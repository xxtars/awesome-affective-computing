      "abstract": "Face forgery detection encompasses multiple critical tasks, including identifying forged images and videos and localizing manipulated regions and temporal segments. Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications. The source code is made available at https://github.com/haotianll/OmniFD.",

      "abstract": "Organic photochromic compounds represent a crucial class of smart-responsive materials, widely utilized in the fields comprising information storage and anti-counterfeiting. However, their practical applications are often hindered by intrinsic limitations, including lack of multifunctionality and poor stability. These shortcomings impede the realization of versatile performances, restrict compatibility with various anti-counterfeiting strategies, and consequently narrow their application prospects. Therefore, aiming at effectively keeping information security, it is imperative to develop novel materials capable of adapting to a broad range of encryption techniques. Herein this study, a thiophene-stilbene-based optical switching system was successfully developed in the solid state, based on three newly synthesized photochromic molecules: 3,3'-(2,2-diphenylethene-1,1-diyl)bis(benzo[b]thiophene) (2PBS), 3,3'-(2-phenylethene-1,1-diyl)bis(benzo[b]thiophene) (HPBS), and (Z)-1,2-bis(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)-1,2-diphenylethene (2PSF), whose reversible and high-contrast photochromic properties were found along with bright fluorescence emission. Upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, the system suffered a rapid photochromic process from white to vivid red or violet, while quickly reverting to the original color under visible light, whereas this ideal material may effectively address practical application barriers required for time-dependent color changes and high sensitivity. In order to enhance its versatility, such a system is seamlessly integrated with various encryption mechanisms, e.g. temperature- and time-based strategies, based on the combination of an aryl vinyl backbone with photoactive thiophene moiety, in addition of integrating logic gates and computational base conversions, while embedding key decryption parameters into complex program logic to promote data protection. Surprisingly, this approach enables to simply achieve near-unlimited information storage by increasing the sample size, suggested by theoretical analysis.",

      "abstract": "Remote physiological measurement enables the capture of vital signals in a non-contact way, which offers significant potential for various applications. Monitoring these signals is achieved through video cameras or radio frequency (RF) sensors, with recent few methods attempting to fuse both sources to leverage complementary patterns for enhanced accuracy. However, these two modalities operate on distinct principles, where video-based methods detect subtle facial color changes from blood volume variations, while RF-based methods capture subtle body vibration due to heartbeats. In practical applications, they may encounter interference at different occasions. Treating these modalities as equally reliable in all situations can lead to suboptimal fusion. To address this issue, we propose an evidential video-RF fusion framework for robust remote physiological signal measurement. We design an uncertainty regression head for each uni-modality, which estimates uncertainty features together with the corresponding physiological signal in each branch. Then an evidential multi-modal fusion module is employed to dynamically fuse the two modalities according to their uncertainty. Extensive experiments carried on public and self-collected datasets show that the proposed method not only achieves superior fusion performance on easy data collected under well-controlled environment, it also generalizes well to unseen data which represents challenging practical conditions that one or both sensors are disturbed.",

      "abstract": "Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.",

Although the topic has attracted considerable research interest, progress has been hindered by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets. To address this gap, the Micro-Action Analysis Grand Challenge (MAC) is organized annually. This paper presents an overview of the 2nd Micro-Action Analysis Grand Challenge, held in conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2025. We provide a comprehensive summary of the challenge, including its dataset, evaluation protocol, results, and discussion. The top-ranked solutions are highlighted to offer valuable insights for researchers, and potential future directions are outlined to guide ongoing developments in this area. The goal of this grand challenge is to foster innovative research in micro-action analysis and advance research in the human-centric action understanding community.",

      "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition (OV-MER) aims to predict emotions without being constrained by label spaces, enabling fine-grained emotion understanding. Unlike traditional discriminative methods, OV-MER leverages generative models to capture the full spectrum of emotions and employs emotion wheels (EWs) for metric calculation. Previous approaches (e.g., AffectGPT) primarily rely on token-level loss during training. However, this objective is misaligned with the metrics used in OV-MER, while these metrics cannot be optimized via gradient backpropagation. To address this limitation, we propose AffectGPT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that treats EW-based metrics as a reward function and applies policy optimization to maximize this reward. Additionally, we introduce an explicit reasoning process and examine its necessity in OV-MER. To further guide model behavior, we incorporate auxiliary rewards that regularize both emotion reasoning and emotion prediction. We also apply length penalties to mitigate reward hacking. Experimental results demonstrate that AffectGPT-R1 yields significant performance improvements on OV-MER. Moreover, our approach enhances generalized emotion understanding, achieving state-of-the-art results on MER-UniBench. Our code is provided in the supplementary material and will be released to facilitate future research.",

We first investigate the differences in expressive occurrences, including their frequency, intensity, and duration of the two ethnic groups, and then evaluate the representative computational models on their vulnerability of being impacted by the cross-cultural domain shift.One of our hypotheses is that AU detection models are less affected by the cross-cultural domain shift than the ME recognition models, as the AUs are more rigorously defined according to anatomics by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Experimental results on 4DME, SMIC, and BP4D datasets are supportive of the hypothesis. Future research should work towards building ethnically balanced datasets and developing culturally adaptive models, especially for ME recognition.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a multimodal emotion recognition system, VIsual Spoken Textual Additive Net (VISTANet), to classify emotions reflected by input containing image, speech, and text into discrete classes. A new interpretability technique, K-Average Additive exPlanation (KAAP), has been developed that identifies important visual, spoken, and textual features leading to predicting a particular emotion class. The VISTANet fuses information from image, speech, and text modalities using a hybrid of intermediate and late fusion. It automatically adjusts the weights of their intermediate outputs while computing the weighted average. The KAAP technique computes the contribution of each modality and corresponding features toward predicting a particular emotion class. To mitigate the insufficiency of multimodal emotion datasets labelled with discrete emotion classes, we have constructed the IIT-R MMEmoRec dataset consisting of images, corresponding speech and text, and emotion labels (‘angry,’ ‘happy,’ ‘hate,’ and ‘sad’). The VISTANet has resulted in an overall emotion recognition accuracy of 80.11% on the IIT-R MMEmoRec dataset using visual, spoken, and textual modalities, outperforming single or dual-modality configurations. The code and data can be accessed at github.com/MIntelligence-Group/MMEmoRec.",

Existing methods enforce the model to concentrate on isolating gaze-pertinent features by filtering out irrelevant ones. This paper proposes an advanced generalized framework for gaze estimation, which employs multi-scale gaze zone prediction as an auxiliary task to improve generalization capabilities. Specifically, each facial image is assigned a discrete zone sub-label, alongside the continuous gaze direction label. In addition, we introduce the triplet loss module and the feature consistency branch to ensure that the extracted features within each zone maintain ordered embeddings and robustness to the environmental variations, respectively. The results from comprehensive experiments reveal that the proposed method outperforms all the state-of-the-art generalized gaze estimation methods. The code will be available at github.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by depression's significant impact on global health, this work proposes MultiDepNet, a novel multi-modal interpretable depression detection system integrating visual, physiological, audio, and textual data. Through ded-icated feature extraction methods (MTCNN for video, TS-CAN for physiological, ResNet-18 for audio, and RoBERTa for text modalities) and a strategic fusion of modality-specific networks including CNN-RNN, Transformer, MLP, and ResNet-18, it achieves significant advancements in depression detection. Its performance, evaluated across four benchmark datasets (AVEC 2013, AVEC 2014, DAIC, and E-DAIC), demonstrates average MAE of 5.64, RMSE of 7.15, accuracy of 74.19%, precision of 0.7373, re-call of 0.7378, and F1 of 0.7376. It also implements a Multiviz-based interpretability mechanism that computes each modality's contribution to the model's performance. The results reveal the visual modality to be the most signifi-cant, contributing 37.88% towards depression detection.",

      "abstract": "In order to achieve early screening and assist clinical decision-making, automatic depression assessment based on multimodal data are highly anticipated. However, the existed methods often suffer from semantic gap and information redundancy due to heterogeneity among modalities. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a novel Feature Disentanglement and Fusion Network (FDFNet) for predicting depression severity from audio-visual cues. Firstly, we design the shared and private encoders to disentangle modality-shared and modalityprivate representations. The former representation that acquires joint information is subjected by similarity constraints between modalities to ensure their distributions as close as possible. The latter that can capture unique features of each modality is restrained by independence constraints for keeping their distributions distinct. The decoder is then developed to reconstruct unimodal representation with constraints to minimize information loss. Finally, an efficient fusion strategy through addition and concatenation is ultilized for aggregating information. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed FDFNet consistently outperforms several stateof-the-art methods, with the competitive MAE/RMSE values of 6.22/7.58 on AVEC2013, 5.21/6.49 on AVEC2014, 4.25/5.34 on DAIC-WOZ, and 4.41/5.10 on E-DAIC, indicating that multimodal deep learning based on audio-visual is an attractive solution for objectively evaluating the depression severity.",

      "abstract": "On the technical side, both traditional, shallow feature-based methods (e.g., Support Vector Machines and Random Forest) and deep neural network models (e.g., LSTM and CNN types) have been utilized (Khare et al., 2024;Pepa et al., 2023). A key focus has been the development of multimodal systems that integrate diverse data sources, such as facial expressions, voice tone, dialogue sentiment, and physiological signals (Geetha et al., 2024). Multiple signals enable the aggregation of complementary information, leveraging the strengths of various measurement techniques to enhance robustness and accuracy.Technology is only effective with users; thus, beyond developing methods, fostering adoption among professionals and citizens is essential. Alongside technical advancements, researchers have explored psychological and social factors influencing the acceptance and trust of AI systems, particularly in healthcare and education. Trust has proven pivotal for AI adoption, with studies investigating how to build it and what system attributes ensure trustworthiness (Li et al., 2024). Key trust factors include explainability, transparency in processes and data usage, and the credibility of the institutions behind AI development.This Research Topic explores novel theories, methodologies, and applications of Emotion AI in healthcare and education. The published works address technical aspects, models, and AI acceptance and literacy. Burgess et al. (2023) evaluated automated facial coding software for parent-infant interactions across five studies with fathers and mothers. Automated detection rates were low (~25%) compared to manual coding in naturalistic settings but strongly correlated with manual assessments, particularly for positive expressions, when successful. Key challenges included poor lighting, facial occlusion, and rapid movements, highlighting the need for greater robustness in real-world conditions. Despite these limitations, the study demonstrated the potential of automated systems for analyzing authentic emotional expressions in parent-child interactions. 2023) introduced an innovative semi-supervised learning approach for stress monitoring. Using physiological data from 14 participants across five experiments, they achieved 77% accuracy with label propagation and 76% with deep autoencoders despite utilizing only 17% labeled data. Their method matched the performance of fully supervised approaches while substantially reducing annotation requirements, offering a practical solution for continuous stress monitoring in real-world healthcare applications. Žvanut and Mihelič (2024) identified four distinct attitudes among older adults toward domestic social robots: Cautious Optimists, Skeptical Traditionalists, Positive Optimists, and Technophiles. Through interviews with 24 participants, they highlighted the influence of factors like technology familiarity, privacy concerns, and perceived utility on AI acceptance. Their findings offer valuable insights for designing emotionally intelligent robotic assistants tailored to diverse user needs and concerns. Shen and Cui (2024) investigated the link between psychological needs satisfaction and AI literacy in 445 university students. Their findings revealed that technical and teacher support positively impacted students&#39; autonomy and competence, subsequently improving AI literacy. Notably, satisfying psychological needs proved more critical than direct support in enhancing AI literacy. These insights offer valuable guidance for designing AI-enhanced educational environments that foster better learning and engagement. Gong et al. (2024) examined patients&#39; trust in AI-powered pharmacy intravenous admixture services across five studies. They found that patients generally trusted AI PIVAS less than human services, primarily due to a limited subjective understanding of AI systems. However, informed consent significantly improved trust by enhancing patients&#39; understanding. This study underscores the critical role of transparent communication and psychological factors in adopting AI in healthcare.The articles in this Research Topic advance methods for analyzing real-world datasets and explore how Emotion AI can be effectively integrated into healthcare and education, addressing challenges related to trust, privacy, and user acceptance. While Emotion AI shows promise, its use in these fields raises technical and ethical concerns, including data privacy, surveillance, and potential misuse of personal information. Clinical applications are further constrained by small sample sizes, lack of control groups, limited real-world testing, and methodological variability, which hinder reproducibility and reliability (Pepa et al., 2023). These studies tackle these challenges by developing novel model-training approaches for limited and noisy labeled data and identifying factors influencing AI acceptance and trust.Future research should prioritize enhancing the robustness of emotion recognition in naturalistic settings, developing efficient learning methods to reduce dependence on labeled data, and addressing ethical considerations to support user acceptance of AI. Emphasis on cross-cultural validation and long-term evaluation in real-world applications is crucial. Recent generative AI (GenAI) foundation models, such as GPT-4, offer significant potential for advancing Emotion AI due to their versatility (Cheng et al., 2023). GenAI has already shown promise in recognizing emotional indicators (Elyoseph et al., 2024) and could help alleviate data scarcity challenges that hinder specialized model development. Additionally, there is growing interest in the emotional analysis of groups and crowds, broadening the field&#39;s scope (Veltmeijer et al., 2023;Li et al. 2024).",

In recent years, a growing trend towards deeper understanding of human emotional states has led to a gradual shift in the attention of multimedia and computer vision researchers from macro facial expressions to whole-body micro-actions. Micro-actions are spontaneous body movements that indicate a person's true feelings and potential intentions. Yet, recognizing, distinguishing, and understanding micro-actions is challenging because they are subtle compared to normal actions. This grand challenge aims to foster innovative research in micro-action analysis and provide benchmark evaluations to advance the technology in the human-centric action understanding community.",

A decade after the inception of the widely used CASME II and SMIC datasets, research in computational analysis of MEs has now advanced toward new pathways, exploring problems crucial to model generalization and real-world practicality. It is often challenging to design robust algorithms or models for spotting micro-expressions due to the high variability across diverse cultural backgrounds. Also, treating spotting and recognition as separate tasks is undesirable when handling long-spanning videos under realistic settings. This Grand Challenge comprises two distinct tracks: the Cross-Cultural Spotting (CCS) track, and the Spot-Then-Recognize (STR) track. All participating solutions submitted their results to a leaderboard, and several submissions performed well surpassing their respective baseline results.

      "abstract": "Face forgery detection is crucial in preserving the security and integrity of facial data amidst the rapid developments in face manipulation techniques and deep generative models. Existing methods for video face forgery detection typically assume that all frames in a forged video are manipulated, while identifying partially forged videos with only a subset of altered frames is still a challenge to be solved. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, i.e., the UVIF, that utilizes additional annotated images to provide fine-grained supervision for detecting partial forgeries in videos. The UVIF integrates a unified encoder and a multi-task learning paradigm to model both facial videos and images for boosted video face forgery detection. A 2D backbone with temporal fusion modules is employed for the unified encoder. A pseudo labeling process is also designed for facial video frames to bridge the representation of individual video frames and static images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in detecting partially forged videos while introducing no additional computational overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/haotianll/UVIF.",

Existing works require extra buffers to store old exemplars for maintaining previously learned knowledge. However, it is infeasible when previous data is unavailable due to storage and privacy issues. This paper focuses on a more challenging but practical exemplar-free IDD problem that requests zero old exemplars when updating the model. To address this problem, we design a domain-adaptive module that uses independent adapters to learn domain-specific knowledge for each domain, avoiding using old exemplars. Besides, we introduce an uncertainty optimization strategy to optimize the adapters more efficiently. With excellent scalability, our method can be easily deployed to various models. To simulate the practical scenarios, we designed two new protocols based on diverse deepfake datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. The code is available at https://github.com/woody-panda/EF-IDD.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

      "abstract": "Engagement analysis finds various applications in healthcare, education, advertisement, services. Deep Neural Networks, used for analysis, possess complex architecture and need large amounts of input data, computational power, inference time. These constraints challenge embedding systems into devices for real-time use. To address these limitations, we present a novel two-stream feature fusion \"Tensor-Convolution and Convolution-Transformer Network\" (TCCT-Net) architecture. To better learn the meaningful patterns in the temporal-spatial domain, we design a \"CT\" stream that integrates a hybrid convolutional-transformer. In parallel, to efficiently extract rich patterns from the temporal-frequency domain and boost processing speed, we introduce a \"TC\" stream that uses Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to represent information in a 2D tensor form. Evaluated on the EngageNet dataset, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines, utilizing only two behavioral features (head pose rotations) compared to the 98 used in baseline models. Furthermore, comparative analysis shows TCCT-Net’s architecture offers an order-of-magnitude improvement in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art image-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/vedernikovphoto/TCCT_Net.",

The use of physiological and behavioral features is viable, but the impracticality of traditional physiological measurement arises due to the need for contact sensors. We demonstrate the feasibility of unsupervised remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) as an alternative for contact sensors in deriving heart rate variability (HRV) features, then fusing these with behavioral features to measure engagement in online group meetings. Firstly, a unique Engagement Dataset of online interactions among social workers is collected with granular engagement labels, offering insight into virtual meeting dynamics. Secondly, a pre-trained rPPG model is customized to reconstruct rPPG signals from video meetings in an unsupervised manner, enabling the calculation of HRV features. Thirdly, the feasibility of estimating engagement from HRV features using short observation windows, with a notable enhancement when using longer observation windows of two to four minutes, is demonstrated. Fourthly, the effectiveness of behavioral cues is evaluated when fused with physiological data, which further enhances engagement estimation performance. An accuracy of 94% is achieved when only HRV features are used, eliminating the need for contact sensors or ground truth signals; use of behavioral cues raises the accuracy to 96%. Facial analysis offers precise engagement measurement, beneficial for future applications.",

      "abstract": "In the fields of photolithographic patterning, optical anticounterfeiting, and information encryption, reversible photochromic materials with solid-state fluorescence are emerging as a potential class of systems. A design strategy for reversible photochromic materials has been proposed and synthesized through the introduction of photoactive thiophene groups into the molecular backbone of aryl vinyls, compounds with unique aggregation-induced emission properties, and solid-state reversible photocontrollable fluorescence and color-changing properties. This work develops novel photochromic inks, films, and cellulose hydrogels for enhancing the security of information encryption and anticounterfeiting technologies. They achieve rapid and reversible color change under ultraviolet light irradiation. Dependent upon the rate of color change, higher levels of time-resolved security can be achieved. This feature is important for enhancing the confidentiality of encrypted information and the reliability of security labels. Color-changing cellulose hydrogels, inks, and films consisting of three photochromic fluorescent molecules have quick photoactivity, great photoreversibility and photostability, and good processability, making them ideal for time-delayed anticounterfeiting and smart encryption. Furthermore, specialized algorithms are used to construct convolutional neural networks, and image analysis is performed on these systems, thus solving the current problem of the time-consuming information decryption process. This artificial intelligence method offers new opportunities for enhanced data encryption.",

The method combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The training phase involves normalizing the dataset, segmenting the sample sequence, extracting spatial features using a CNN, mining the temporal pattern using a GRU, and performing fully-connected feature fusion. The model parameters are trained and saved multiple times. In the testing phase, the algorithm verification and testing are conducted using the test set and the trained model to obtain a separated signal. The experimental results are compared with a traditional single-channel blind source separation algorithm and a deep learning blind so10urce separation algorithm with a single network structure. The proposed algorithm demonstrates high accuracy, a low distortion rate, and superior separation performance for complex mixed signals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A method for Underdetermined Blind Source Separation is proposed using third‐order cumulants and tensor compression. To effectively suppress symmetrical distributed noise, the third‐order cumulant is considered. Additionally, the complexity of high‐dimensional tensors can be reduced through high order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) for compression purposes. The method begins by calculating the third‐order cumulant tensor for whitening signals at different time delays, and then stacks several cumulants into a fourth‐order tensor. The HOSVD decomposition is applied to the fourth‐order tensor, compressing the high‐dimensional tensor into a low‐dimensional core tensor. Next, the core tensor is further decomposed using the canonical polyadic decomposition, and the resulting factor matrices are fused to obtain an estimation of the mixed matrix. Finally, leveraging the signal independence, a matrix diagonalisation method is employed to recover the source signals. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses the influence of Gaussian noise, reduces computational complexity, and saves computational time. Moreover, compared with five representative approaches, the proposed method achieves superior separation results. Specifically, for the 3 × 4 mixed model with a signal‐to‐noise ratio of 20 dB, the average relative error of speech signal and radio signal are −11.02 and −6.8 dB respectively.",

The importance of these psychological states has been increasingly recognized due to their implications for mental health and well-being. Stress and depression are interrelated and together they impact engagement in daily tasks, highlighting the need to explore their interplay. This survey is the first to simultaneously explore computational methods for analyzing stress, depression and engagement. We present a taxonomy and timeline of the computational approaches used to analyze them and we discuss the most commonly used datasets and input modalities, along with the categories and generic pipeline of these approaches. Subsequently, we describe state-of-the-art computational approaches, including a performance summary on the most commonly used datasets. Following this, we explore the applications of stress, depression and engagement analysis, along with the associated challenges, limitations and future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Video-based remote physiological measurement utilizes facial videos to measure the blood volume change signal, which is also called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). Supervised methods for rPPG measurements have been shown to achieve good performance. However, the drawback of these methods is that they require facial videos with ground truth (GT) physiological signals, which are often costly and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose Contrast-Phys+, a method that can be trained in both unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings. We employ a 3DCNN model to generate multiple spatiotemporal rPPG signals and incorporate prior knowledge of rPPG into a contrastive loss function. We further incorporate the GT signals into contrastive learning to adapt to partial or misaligned labels. The contrastive loss encourages rPPG/GT signals from the same video to be grouped together, while pushing those from different videos apart. We evaluate our methods on five publicly available datasets that include both RGB and Near-infrared videos. Contrast-Phys+ outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, even when using partially available or misaligned GT signals, or no labels at all. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of our methods in terms of computational efficiency, noise robustness, and generalization.",

      "abstract": "Video-based Photoplethysmography (VPPG) offers the capability to measure heart rate (HR) from facial videos. However, the reliability of the HR values extracted through this method remains uncertain, especially when videos are affected by various disturbances. Confronted by this challenge, we introduce an innovative framework for VPPG-based HR measurements, with a focus on capturing diverse sources of uncertainty in the predicted HR values. In this context, a neural network named HRUNet is structured for HR extraction from input facial videos. Departing from the conventional training approach of learning specific weight (and bias) values, we leverage the Bayesian posterior estimation to derive weight distributions within HRUNet. These distributions allow for sampling to encode uncertainty stemming from HRUNet's limited performance. On this basis, we redefine HRUNet's output as a distribution of potential HR values, as opposed to the traditional emphasis on the single most probable HR value. The underlying goal is to discover the uncertainty arising from inherent noise in the input video. HRUNet is evaluated across 1,098 videos from seven datasets, spanning three scenarios: undisturbed, motion-disturbed, and light-disturbed. The ensuing test outcomes demonstrate that uncertainty in the HR measurements increases significantly in the scenarios marked by disturbances, compared to that in the undisturbed scenario. Moreover, HRUNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in HR accuracy when excluding HR values with 0.4 uncertainty. This underscores that uncertainty emerges as an informative indicator of potentially erroneous HR measurements. With enhanced reliability affirmed, the VPPG technique holds the promise for applications in safety-critical domains.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A novel underdetermined blind separation method is proposed based on signal slice and tensor decomposition to explore effective statistical information and improve separation performance. Firstly, the whitening signal is partitioned into several slices, and the delay covariance matrix of each slice is calculated. These delay covariance matrices are then stacked into third-order tensors and compressed into low-dimensional core tensors using high-order singular value decomposition. Next, the third-order tensors are decomposed using canonical polyadic decomposition through weight nonlinear least square to obtain the mixed matrix. Finally, by leveraging signal independence, a matrix diagonalization method is employed to recover the source signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses the influence of Gaussian noise and improves the estimation accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method achieves superior separation results compared to seven representative approaches.",

      "abstract": "Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. Unfortunately, the small sample problem severely limits the automation of ME analysis. Furthermore, due to the weak and transient nature of MEs, it is difficult for models to distinguish it from other types of facial actions. Therefore, ME in long videos is a challenging task, and the current performance cannot meet the practical application requirements. Addressing these issues, this challenge focuses on ME and the macro-expression (MaE) spotting task. This year, in order to evaluate algorithms' performance more fairly, based on CAS(ME)2, SAMM Long Videos, SMIC-E-long, CAS(ME)3 and 4DME, we build an unseen cross-cultural long-video test set. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard with a baseline result.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are facial movements that are extremely short and not easily detected, which often reflect the genuine emotions of individuals. Micro-expressions are important cues for understanding real human emotions and can be used for non-contact, non-perceptual deception detection, or abnormal emotion recognition. It has broad application prospects in national security, judicial practice, health prevention, and clinical practice. However, micro-expression feature extraction and learning are highly challenging because they are typically short in duration, low intensity, and have local facial asymmetry. In addition, the intelligent micro-expression analysis combined with deep learning technology is also plagued by the problem of relatively small data samples. Not only is micro-expression elicitation very difficult, micro-expression annotation is also very time-consuming and laborious. More importantly, the micro-expression generation mechanism is not yet clear, which shackles the application of micro-expressions in real scenarios. FME'23 is the inaugural workshop in this area of research, with the aim of promoting interactions between researchers and scholars from within this niche area of research. This year we hope to discuss the growing ethical conversations when using face data, and how we can come to a consensus on micro-expression standards within affective computing.",

      "abstract": "The separation of time–frequency mixing signals composed of radar, communication, and jamming is the first step in integrated reception processing, which requires higher accuracy for complex blind source separation (CVBSS). However, traditional CVBSS methods have limitations such as low separation accuracy, a slow convergence speed, and poor robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high jamming-to-signal ratio (JSR) scenarios. To address the above issues, this paper firstly establishes a time delay mixing mathematical model. A robust whitening algorithm is proposed by using the time delay correlation matrix of the observed signal, which is insensitive to noise. Secondly, the joint diagonalized F-parametrization is used as the objective function, and the separation matrix is constructed based on the multiple complex-valued Givens matrices. The complex-valued Givens matrix not only ensures orthogonality in the separation matrix but also effectively reduces the number of parameters to be calculated. This approach guarantees accuracy and simplifies the complexity of the separation process. Finally, the nonlinear chaotic grey wolf optimizer is utilized to search for the optimal rotation angle. The simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm offers higher separation accuracy and requires fewer iterations compared to the traditional algorithm. Additionally, it enhances the accuracy of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, reduces the communication bit error rate, and enables the joint estimation of the target distance and velocity even in the presence of powerful jamming and a low SNR.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have found that blood volume pulse (BVP) in facial videos contains features highly correlated to blood pressure (BP). However, the mapping from BVP features to BP varies from person to person. To address this issue, VidBP has been proposed as a BP detector that can be calibrated based on an individual's data. VidBP is pre-trained on a large dataset to extract BP-related features from BVP. Then, BVP samples and BP labels of an individual are fed into the pre-trained VidBP to create a personal dictionary of BP-related features. When estimating the individual's BP, the current BP-related feature is compared to the features saved in the dictionary, and the BP labels of the similar features are considered as the BP estimate. The performance of VidBP was evaluated on 640 samples of 16 subjects, and it demonstrated significantly lower errors in BP estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods. The personalized calibration of VidBP is a significant advantage, enabling it to better capture the unique mapping from BVP features to BP for each individual.Clinical relevance This study reports a feasible method to estimate BP from facial videos, providing a convenient and cost-effective way for home BP monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression (ME) is an involuntary, fleeting, and subtle facial expression. It may occur in high-stake situations when people attempt to conceal or suppress their true feelings. Therefore, MEs can provide essential clues to people's true feelings and have plenty of potential applications, such as national security, clinical diagnosis, and interrogations. In recent years, ME analysis has gained much attention in various fields due to its practical importance, especially automatic ME analysis in computer vision as MEs are difficult to process by naked eyes. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of ME development in the field of computer vision, from the ME studies in psychology and early attempts in computer vision to various computational ME analysis methods and future directions. Four main tasks in ME analysis are specifically discussed, including ME spotting, ME recognition, ME action unit detection, and ME generation in terms of the approaches, advance developments, and challenges. Through this survey, readers can understand MEs in both aspects of psychology and computer vision, and apprehend the future research direction in ME analysis.",

It introduces a multimodal framework for emotion understanding by fusing the information from visual facial features and rPPG signals extracted from the input videos. An interpretability technique based on permutation feature importance analysis has also been implemented to compute the contributions of rPPG and visual modalities toward classifying a given input video into a particular emotion class. The experiments on IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that the emotion classification performance improves by combining the complementary information from multiple modalities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We explore using body gestures for hidden emotional state analysis. As an important non-verbal communicative fashion, human body gestures are capable of conveying emotional information during social communication. In previous works, efforts have been made mainly on facial expressions, speech, or expressive body gestures to interpret classical expressive emotions. Differently, we focus on a specific group of body gestures, called micro-gestures (MGs), used in the psychology research field to interpret inner human feelings. MGs are subtle and spontaneous body movements that are proven, together with micro-expressions, to be more reliable than normal facial expressions for conveying hidden emotional information. In this work, a comprehensive study of MGs is presented from the computer vision aspect, including a novel spontaneous micro-gesture (SMG) dataset with two emotional stress states and a comprehensive statistical analysis indicating the correlations between MGs and emotional states. Novel frameworks are further presented together with various state-of-the-art methods as benchmarks for automatic classification, online recognition of MGs, and emotional stress state recognition. The dataset and methods presented could inspire a new way of utilizing body gestures for human emotion understanding and bring a new direction to the emotion AI community. The source code and dataset are made available: https://github.com/mikecheninoulu/SMG .",

      "abstract": "Abstract According to studies, electric bicycles are used in large numbers in ancient villages as the main means of transportation. Electric bicycles are the primary source of fire risk in old villages, where the majority of houses are huge, fire-prone timber and brick constructions. In this paper, an electric fire safety device for electric bicycle chargers based on anti-electrode reversal technology is devised in order to avoid electrical fires produced by electric bicycle chargers. First, based on statistical data, the primary reasons why electric bicycle chargers catch fire are introduced. Then, the software design scheme of the system is built, and the architectural form of the electrical fire prevention device for electric bicycle chargers and related circuits is designed for the sources of fire. The created protection device can manage battery charging by observing the charging voltage to prevent the fire produced by thermal runaway of the battery as a result of overcharging. It can also protect the charger from burning caused by battery reversal during charging.",

In this paper, according to the technical content of the draft national standard of current-limited protector, the test methods of short-circuit protection performance, overload protection performance and non-action performance of current-limited protector are proposed. On this basis, this paper develops the current limiting protector test equipment based on thyristor phase control technology, designs the phase analysis control circuit, distribution line voltage sampling and analysis circuit and thyristor drive circuit, analyzes the working principle of each part of the circuit, and proposes the software development process of MCU. This paper proposes a test method for current limiting protectors sufficient to evaluate the performance of current limiting protectors in a scientific and objective manner. The designed test equipment, which realizes the automatic test of current limiting protector, provides an effective means for the performance test of current limiting protector.",

Unfortunately, the small sample problem severely limits the automation of ME analysis. Furthermore, due to the brief and subtle nature of ME, ME spotting is a challenging task, and the performance is still not satisfactory yet. This challenge focuses on two tasks, i.e., the micro- and macro-expression spotting task, and the ME Generation task.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective . Efficient non-contact heart rate (HR) measurement from facial video has received much attention in health monitoring. Past methods relied on prior knowledge and an unproven hypothesis to extract remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals, e.g. manually designed regions of interest (ROIs) and the skin reflection model. Approach . This paper presents a short-time end to end HR estimation framework based on facial features and temporal relationships of video frames. In the proposed method, a deep 3D multi-scale network with cross-layer residual structure is designed to construct an autoencoder and extract robust rPPG features. Then, a spatial-temporal fusion mechanism is proposed to help the network focus on features related to rPPG signals. Both shallow and fused 3D spatial-temporal features are distilled to suppress redundant information in the complex environment. Finally, a data augmentation strategy is presented to solve the problem of uneven distribution of HR in existing datasets. Main results . The experimental results on four face-rPPG datasets show that our method overperforms the state-of-the-art methods and requires fewer video frames. Compared with the previous best results, the proposed method improves the root mean square error (RMSE) by 5.9%, 3.4% and 21.4% on the OBF dataset (intra-test), COHFACE dataset (intra-test) and UBFC dataset (cross-test), respectively. Significance . Our method achieves good results on diverse datasets (i.e. highly compressed video, low-resolution and illumination variation), demonstrating that our method can extract stable rPPG signals in short time.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Blind Source Separation (BSS) of complex signals composed of radar, communication and jamming signals is the first step in an integrated electronic system, which requires higher accuracy of separation. However, the traditional Single‐Channel Blind Source Separation (SCBSS) method has low separation accuracy and poor robustness. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a SCBSS method based on spatial‐temporal fusion deep learning model. This is a deep neural network model, which realizes spatial‐temporal of mixed signals by integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short‐Term Memory Network (BiLSTM). Convolutional Neural Network is used to extract spatial features from input sequences, and BiLSTM is used to mine timing rules of signals. A batch normalisation layer and a dropout layer are added to improve stability and prevent overfitting. The experiments show that the average similarity coefficient of the separated signals is above 0.99 and the Signal‐Distortion Ratio (SDR) is up to 27 dB without noise. When the Signal‐Noise Ratio is 0–20 dB and Jamming‐Signal Ratio is 15 dB, the SDR is 5–30 dB higher than the traditional methods and the single network structure deep learning methods.",

Attaching physiological sensors are used for such stress monitoring and analysis. Such approach is feasible only when the person is physically presented. Due to the transfer of the life from offline to online, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, remote stress measurement is of high importance. This study investigated the feasibility of estimating participants’ stress levels based on remote physiological signal features (rPPG) and behavioral features (facial expression and motion) obtained from facial videos recorded during online video meetings. Remote physiological signal features provided higher accuracy of stress estimation (78.75%) as compared to those based on motion (70.00%) and facial expression (73.75%) features. Moreover, the fusion of behavioral and remote physiological signal features increased the accuracy of stress estimation up to 82.50%.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (ME) are a special form of facial expressions which may occur when people try to hide their true feelings for some reasons. MEs are important clues to reveal people's true feelings, but are difficult or impossible to be captured by ordinary persons with naked-eyes as they are very short and subtle. It is expected that robust computer vision methods can be developed to automatically analyze MEs which requires lots of ME data. The current ME datasets are insufficient, and mostly contain only one single form of 2D color videos. Researches on 4D data of ordinary facial expressions have prospered, but so far no 4D data is available in ME study. In the current study, we introduce the 4DME dataset: a new spontaneous ME dataset which includes 4D data along with three other video modalities. Both micro- and macro-expression clips are labeled out in 4DME, and 22 AU labels and five categories of emotion labels are annotated. Experiments are carried out using three 2D-based methods and one 4D-based method to provide baseline results. The results indicate that the 4D data can potentially benefit ME recognition. The 4DME dataset could be used for developing 4D-based approaches, or exploring fusion of multiple video sources (e.g., texture and depth) for the task of ME analysis in future. Besides, we also emphasize the importance of forming a clear and unified criteria of ME annotation for future ME data collection studies. Several key questions related with ME annotation are listed and discussed in depth, especially about the relationship between AUs and ME emotion categories. A preliminary AU-Emo mapping table is proposed with justified explanations and supportive experimental results. Several unsolved issues are also summarized for future work.",

      "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has lately attracted increasing attention due to its vital role in securing face recognition systems from presentation attacks (PAs). As more and more realistic PAs with novel types spring up, early-stage FAS methods based on handcrafted features become unreliable due to their limited representation capacity. With the emergence of large-scale academic datasets in the recent decade, deep learning based FAS achieves remarkable performance and dominates this area. However, existing reviews in this field mainly focus on the handcrafted features, which are outdated and uninspiring for the progress of FAS community. In this paper, to stimulate future research, we present the first comprehensive review of recent advances in deep learning based FAS. It covers several novel and insightful components: 1) besides supervision with binary label (e.g., '0' for bonafide versus '1' for PAs), we also investigate recent methods with pixel-wise supervision (e.g., pseudo depth map); 2) in addition to traditional intra-dataset evaluation, we collect and analyze the latest methods specially designed for domain generalization and open-set FAS; and 3) besides commercial RGB camera, we summarize the deep learning applications under multi-modal (e.g., depth and infrared) or specialized (e.g., light field and flash) sensors. We conclude this survey by emphasizing current open issues and highlighting potential prospects.",

      "abstract": "The invisible remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals in facial videos can reveal the cardiac rhythm and physiological status. Recent studies show that rPPG is a non-contact way for emotion recognition, disease detection, and biometric identification, which means there is a potential privacy problem about physiological information leakage from facial videos. Therefore, it is essential to process facial videos to prevent rPPG extraction in privacy-sensitive situations such as online video meetings. In this letter, we propose Privacy-Phys, a novel method based on a pre-trained 3D convolutional neural network, to modify rPPG in facial videos for privacy protection. Our experimental results show that our approach can modify rPPG signals in facial videos more effectively and efficiently than the previous baseline. Our method can be applied to process facial videos in online video meetings or video-sharing platforms to prevent rPPG from being captured maliciously.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring physiological changes [e.g., heart rate (HR), respiration, and HR variability (HRV)] is important for measuring human emotions. Physiological responses are more reliable and harder to alter compared to explicit behaviors (such as facial expressions and speech), but they require special contact sensors to obtain. Research in the last decade has shown that photoplethysmography (PPG) signals can be remotely measured (rPPG) from facial videos under ambient light, from which physiological changes can be extracted. This promising finding has attracted much interest from researchers, and the field of rPPG measurement has been growing fast. In this article, we review current progress on intelligent signal processing approaches for rPPG measurement, including earlier works on unsupervised approaches and recently proposed supervised models, benchmark data sets, and performance evaluation. We also review studies on rPPG-based affective applications and compare them with other affective computing modalities. We conclude this article by emphasizing the current main challenges and highlighting future directions.",

Thus, FMEs are very short in duration, an important feature that distinguishes them from ordinary facial expressions. And MEs are considered to be one of the most valuable cues for complex human emotion understanding and lie detection. Since 2014, the computational analysis and automation of MEs have been an emerging area of face research. The workshop will explore various dimensions of the human mind through emotion understanding and FME analysis, as well as extended research based on multi modal approaches.",

      "abstract": "Remote measurement of physiological signals from videos is an emerging topic. The topic draws great interest, but the lack of publicly available benchmark databases and a fair validation platform are hindering its further development. The RePSS Challenge is organized as an annual event for this concern. Here the 2nd RePSS is organized in conjunction with ICCV 2021. The 2nd RePSS contains two competition tracks. Track 1 is to measure inter-beat-intervals (IBI) from facial videos, which requires accurate measurement of each individual pulse peak. Track 2 is about respiration measurement from facial videos, as respiration is another important physiological index related to both health and emotional status. One new dataset is built and shared for Track 2. This paper presents an overview of the challenge, including data, protocol, results, and discussion. We highlighted the top-ranked solutions to provide insight for researchers, and we also outline future directions for this topic and this challenge.",

      "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in securing face recognition systems. Recently, central difference convolution (CDC) has shown its excellent representation capacity for the FAS task via leveraging local gradient features. However, aggregating central difference clues from all neighbors/directions simultaneously makes the CDC redundant and sub-optimized in the training phase. In this paper, we propose two Cross Central Difference Convolutions (C-CDC), which exploit the difference of the center and surround sparse local features from the horizontal/vertical and diagonal directions, respectively. It is interesting to find that, with only five ninth parameters and less computational cost, C-CDC even outperforms the full directional CDC. Based on these two decoupled C-CDC, a powerful Dual-Cross Central Difference Network (DC-CDN) is established with Cross Feature Interaction Modules (CFIM) for mutual relation mining and local detailed representation enhancement. Furthermore, a novel Patch Exchange (PE) augmentation strategy for FAS is proposed via simply exchanging the face patches as well as their dense labels from random samples. Thus, the augmented samples contain richer live/spoof patterns and diverse domain distributions, which benefits the intrinsic and robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets with three testing protocols to demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a sparsity-aware deep network for automatic 3D/4D facial expression recognition (FER). We first propose a novel augmentation method to combat the data limitation problem for deep learning, specifically given 3D/4D face meshes. This is achieved by projecting the input data into RGB and depth map images and then iteratively performing randomized channel concatenation. Encoded in the given 3D landmarks, we also introduce an effective way to capture the facial muscle movements from three orthogonal plans (TOP), the TOP-landmarks over multi-views. Importantly, we then present a sparsity-aware deep network to compute the sparse representations of convolutional features over multi-views. This is not only effective for a higher recognition accuracy but also computationally convenient. For training, the TOP-landmarks and sparse representations are used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for 4D data, and a pre-trained network for 3D data. The refined predictions are achieved when the learned features collaborate over multi-views. Extensive experimental results achieved on the Bosphorus, BU-3DFE, BU-4DFE and BP4D-Spontaneous datasets show the significance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness by reaching a promising accuracy of 99.69% on BU-4DFE for 4D FER.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a new dataset for the emotional artificial intelligence research: identity-free video dataset for Micro-Gesture Understanding and Emotion analysis (iMiGUE). Different from existing public datasets, iMiGUE focuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity information, while the predominant researches of emotion analysis concern sensitive biometric data, like face and speech. Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on micro-gestures, i.e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which are mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore, iMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just recognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is because the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states behind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of imbalanced sample distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method is proposed to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences themselves. We systematically investigate representative methods on this dataset, and comprehensive experimental results reveal several interesting insights from the iMiGUE, e.g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote emotion understanding. We confirm that the new iMiGUE dataset could advance studies of micro-gesture and emotion AI.",

      "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in securing face recognition systems from the presentation attacks (PAs). As more and more realistic PAs with novel types spring up, it is necessary to develop robust algorithms for detecting unknown attacks even in unseen scenarios. However, deep models supervised by traditional binary loss (e.g., `0' for bonafide vs. `1' for PAs) are weak in describing intrinsic and discriminative spoofing patterns. Recently, pixel-wise supervision has been proposed for the FAS task, intending to provide more fine-grained pixel/patch-level cues. In this paper, we firstly give a comprehensive review and analysis about the existing pixel-wise supervision methods for FAS. Then we propose a novel pyramid supervision, which guides deep models to learn both local details and global semantics from multi-scale spatial context. Extensive experiments are performed on five FAS benchmark datasets to show that, without bells and whistles, the proposed pyramid supervision could not only improve the performance beyond existing pixel-wise supervision frameworks, but also enhance the model's interpretability (i.e., locating the patch-level positions of PAs more reasonably). Furthermore, elaborate studies are conducted for exploring the efficacy of different architecture configurations with two kinds of pixel-wise supervisions (binary mask and depth map supervisions), which provides inspirable insights for future architecture/supervision design.",

      "abstract": "3D mask face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays a vital role in securing face recognition systems from emergent 3D mask attacks. Recently, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been developed as an intrinsic liveness clue for 3D mask PAD without relying on the mask appearance. However, the rPPG features for 3D mask PAD are still needed expert knowledge to design manually, which limits its further progress in the deep learning and big data era. In this letter, we propose a pure rPPG transformer (TransRPPG) framework for learning intrinsic liveness representation efficiently. At first, rPPG-based multi-scale spatial-temporal maps (MSTmap) are constructed from facial skin and background regions. Then the transformer fully mines the global relationship within MSTmaps for liveness representation, and gives a binary prediction for 3D mask detection. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the TransRPPG on both intra- and cross-dataset testings. Our TransRPPG is lightweight and efficient (with only 547 K parameters and 763 M FLOPs), which is promising for mobile-level applications.",

MiT incorporates patch and position embeddings from various patches of multi-views and uses them for learning various facial muscle movements to showcase an effective recognition performance. We also propose a multi-view loss function that is not only gradient-friendly, and hence speeds up the gradient computation during back-propagation, but it also leverages the correlation associated with the underlying facial patterns among multi-views. Additionally, we offer multi-view weights that are trainable and learnable, and help substantially in training. Finally, we equip our model with distributed performance for faster learning and computational convenience. With the help of extensive experiments, we show that our model outperform the existing methods on widely-used datasets for 3D/4D FER.",

In the scheme, IM modulation is adopted at the transmitting end to enhance the communication quality of OFDM signal, CS technology is adopted at the radar receiving end to obtain the range-velocity 2-D super resolution image of radar targets, and the method of rapid piecewise reconstruction and second phase-coherent accumulation are further adopted to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional algorithm, this method can significantly improve the processing performance of OFDM-IM RadCom signal and realize ultra-low side lobe in distance, which means the proposed scheme is able to enhance the performance of radar and communication in the same time.",

      "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in securing face recognition systems. Existing methods heavily rely on the expert-designed networks, which may lead to a sub-optimal solution for FAS task. Here we propose the first FAS method based on neural architecture search (NAS), called NAS-FAS, to discover the well-suited task-aware networks. Unlike previous NAS works mainly focus on developing efficient search strategies in generic object classification, we pay more attention to study the search spaces for FAS task. The challenges of utilizing NAS for FAS are in two folds: the networks searched on 1) a specific acquisition condition might perform poorly in unseen conditions, and 2) particular spoofing attacks might generalize badly for unseen attacks. To overcome these two issues, we develop a novel search space consisting of central difference convolution and pooling operators. Moreover, an efficient static-dynamic representation is exploited for fully mining the FAS-aware spatio-temporal discrepancy. Besides, we propose Domain/Type-aware Meta-NAS, which leverages cross-domain/type knowledge for robust searching. Finally, in order to evaluate the NAS transferability for cross datasets and unknown attack types, we release a large-scale 3D mask dataset, namely CASIA-SURF 3DMask, for supporting the new 'cross-dataset cross-type' testing protocol. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed NAS-FAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine FAS benchmark datasets with four testing protocols.",

      "abstract": "The recent emergence of automatic facial micro-expression analysis has attracted a lot of attention in the last five years. Compared to the advances made in micro-expression recognition, the task of micro-expression spotting from long videos is tremendously in need of more effective methods. This paper summarises the 3rd Facial Micro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC 2020) held in conjunction with the 15th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2020. In this workshop, we propose a new challenge of spotting both macro- and micro-expressions from long videos, to spur the community to develop new techniques for micro-expression spotting and also to extend facial micro-expression analysis to more complex real-world scenarios where micro-expressions are likely to be intertwined among normal expressions. In this paper, we outline the evaluation protocols for the challenge task, and describe the datasets involved. Then, we summarize the methods from the accepted challenge papers, present the comparison and analysis of results, as well as future directions.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel landmarks-assisted collaborative end-to-end deep framework for 4D facial expression recognition (FER). Using 4D face scan data, we calculate its various geometrical images, and afterwards use rank pooling to generate their dynamic images encapsulating important facial muscle movements over time. As well, the given 3D landmarks are projected on a 2D plane as binary images and convolutional layers are used to extract sequences of feature vectors for every landmark video. During the training stage, the dynamic images are used to train an end-to-end deep network, while the feature vectors of landmark images are used train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The finally improved set of expression predictions are obtained when the dynamic and landmark images collaborate over multi-views using the proposed deep framework. Performance results obtained from extensive experimentation on the widely-adopted BU-4DFE database under globally used settings prove that our proposed collaborative framework outperforms the state-of-the-art 4D FER methods and reach a promising classification accuracy of 96.7% demonstrating its effectiveness.",

It would directly cause the production of gas wells decreasing, even off production. A number of deliquification techniques have been suggested for solving this kind of problem, but the available techniques are not yet widely applicable. Based on the analysis, the method of deliquification with atomizing nozzle in gas wells was put forward. The test bench was designed for studying the atomization of nozzles and the liquid entrainment of gas flow. The size distribution of atomized droplets was measured by Malvern laser grain size analyzer. The Sauter mean diameters of atomized droplets were analysed under different two-phase flow conditions. The results indicate that the designed nozzles have good atomization performances and show potential application for reducing liquid loading in gas wells.",

In this paper, we revisit this technology via a large video benchmark that includes six categories of practical challenges. We analyze two video properties (i.e. pixel intensity variation and pixel movement) that are essential for respiratory motion analysis and various signal extraction approaches (i.e. from conventional to recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods). We find that pixel movement can better quantify respiratory motion than pixel intensity variation in various conditions. We also conclude that the simple conventional approach (e.g. Zerophase Component Analysis) can achieve better performance than CNN that uses data training to define the extraction of respiration signal, which thus raises a more general question whether CNN can improve video-based physiological signal measurement.",

      "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in face recognition systems. Most state-of-the-art FAS methods 1) rely on stacked convolutions and expert-designed network, which is weak in describing detailed fine-grained information and easily being ineffective when the environment varies (e.g., different illumination), and 2) prefer to use long sequence as input to extract dynamic features, making them difficult to deploy into scenarios which need quick response. Here we propose a novel frame level FAS method based on Central Difference Convolution (CDC), which is able to capture intrinsic detailed patterns via aggregating both intensity and gradient information. A network built with CDC, called the Central Difference Convolutional Network (CDCN), is able to provide more robust modeling capacity than its counterpart built with vanilla convolution. Furthermore, over a specifically designed CDC search space, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is utilized to discover a more powerful network structure (CDCN++), which can be assembled with Multiscale Attention Fusion Module (MAFM) for further boosting performance. Comprehensive experiments are performed on six benchmark datasets to show that 1) the proposed method not only achieves superior performance on intra-dataset testing (especially 0.2% ACER in Protocol-1 of OULU-NPU dataset), 2) it also generalizes well on cross-dataset testing (particularly 6.5% HTER from CASIA-MFSD to Replay-Attack datasets). The codes are available at https://github.com/ZitongYu/CDCN.",

      "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in securing face recognition systems from presentation attacks. Existing multi-modal FAS methods rely on stacked vanilla convolutions, which is weak in describing detailed intrinsic information from modalities and easily being ineffective when the domain shifts (e.g., cross attack and cross ethnicity). In this paper, we extend the central difference convolutional networks (CDCN) [39] to a multimodal version, intending to capture intrinsic spoofing patterns among three modalities (RGB, depth and infrared). Meanwhile, we also give an elaborate study about singlemodal based CDCN. Our approach won the first place in \"Track Multi-Modal\" as well as the second place in \"Track Single-Modal (RGB)\" of ChaLearn Face Antispoofing Attack Detection Challenge@CVPR2020 [20]. Our final submission obtains 1.02±0.59% and 4.84±1.79% ACER in \"Track Multi-Modal\" and \"Track Single-Modal (RGB)\", respectively. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZitongYu/CDCN.",

The topic draws great interests, but the lack of publicly available benchmark databases and a fair validation platform are hindering its further development. For this concern, we organize the first challenge on Remote Physiological Signal Sensing (RePSS), in which two databases of VIPL and OBF are provided as the benchmark for kin researchers to evaluate their approaches. The 1st challenge of RePSS focuses on measuring the average heart rate from facial videos, which is the basic problem of remote physiological measurement. This paper presents an overview of the challenge, including data, protocol, analysis of results and discussion. The top ranked solutions are highlighted to provide insights for researchers, and future directions are outlined for this topic and this challenge.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a sparsity-aware deep network for automatic 4D facial expression recognition (FER). Given 4D data, we first propose a novel augmentation method to combat the data limitation problem for deep learning. This is achieved by projecting the input data into RGB and depth map images and then iteratively performing randomized channel concatenation. Encoded in the given 3D landmarks, we also introduce an effective way to capture the facial muscle movements from three orthogonal plans (TOP), the TOP-landmarks over multi-views. Importantly, we then present a sparsity-aware deep network to compute the sparse representations of convolutional features over multi-views. This is not only effective for a higher recognition accuracy but is also computationally convenient. For training, the TOP-landmarks and sparse representations are used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The refined predictions are achieved when the learned features collaborate over multi-views. Extensive experimental results achieved on the BU-4DFE dataset show the significance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods by reaching a promising accuracy of 99.69% for 4D FER.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a sparsity-aware deep network for automatic 4D facial expression recognition (FER). Given 4D data, we first propose a novel augmentation method to combat the data limitation problem for deep learning. This is achieved by projecting the input data into RGB and depth map images and then iteratively performing randomized channel concatenation. Encoded in the given 3D landmarks, we also introduce an effective way to capture the facial muscle movements from three orthogonal plans (TOP), the TOP-landmarks over multi-views. Importantly, we then present a sparsity-aware deep network to compute the sparse representations of convolutional features over multi-views. This is not only effective for a higher recognition accuracy but is also computationally convenient. For training, the TOP-landmarks and sparse representations are used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The refined predictions are achieved when the learned features collaborate over multi-views. Extensive experimental results achieved on the BU-4DFE dataset show the significance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods by reaching a promising accuracy of 99.69% for 4D FER.",

Existing end-to-end rPPG and heart rate (HR) measurement methods from facial videos are vulnerable to the less-constrained scenarios (e.g., with head movement and bad illumination). In this letter, we explore the reason why existing end-to-end networks perform poorly in challenging conditions and establish a strong end-to-end baseline (AutoHR) for remote HR measurement with neural architecture search (NAS). The proposed method includes three parts: 1) a powerful searched backbone with novel Temporal Difference Convolution (TDC), intending to capture intrinsic rPPG-aware clues between frames; 2) a hybrid loss function considering constraints from both time and frequency domains; and 3) spatio-temporal data augmentation strategies for better representation learning. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testing.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which aims at measuring heart activities without any contact, has great potential in many applications (e.g., remote healthcare). Existing rPPG approaches rely on analyzing very fine details of facial videos, which are prone to be affected by video compression. Here we propose a two-stage, end-to-end method using hidden rPPG information enhancement and attention networks, which is the first attempt to counter video compression loss and recover rPPG signals from highly compressed videos. The method includes two parts: 1) a Spatio-Temporal Video Enhancement Network (STVEN) for video enhancement, and 2) an rPPG network (rPPGNet) for rPPG signal recovery. The rPPGNet can work on its own for robust rPPG measurement, and the STVEN network can be added and jointly trained to further boost the performance especially on highly compressed videos. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets to show that, 1) the proposed method not only achieves superior performance on compressed videos with high-quality videos pair, 2) it also generalizes well on novel data with only compressed videos available, which implies the promising potential for real-world applications.",

In this review, we summarize recent developments of colloidal PCs in the field of anti-counterfeiting from aspects of security strategies, design, and fabrication principles, and identification means. Firstly, an overview of the strategies for constructing PC anti-counterfeiting materials composed of variable color PC patterns, invisible PC prints, and several other PC anti-counterfeiting materials is presented. Then, the synthesis methods, working principles, security level, and specific identification means of these three types of PC materials are discussed in detail. Finally, the summary of strengths and challenges, as well as development prospects in the attractive research field, are presented.",

      "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, which particularly occurs in the elderly individuals with heart disease. Though AF is often asymptomatic during normal activities, it has huge potential risks for stroke and other severe diseases. Thus, early detection of AF has great importance in the field of public health. Currently, electrocardiography (ECG) is the commonly used measure for the diagnosis of AF, which presents the irregular rhythm of waveform for AF patients. However, the measurement of the ECG signal requires special medical acquisition devices, which are not comfortable for practical monitoring in daily life. In this paper, we explore a very promising algorithm to detect AF from remote face videos by analyzing the color variations of face skin. The main challenge is that the current remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technique is rather immature, which causes difficulty in extracting accurate pulse signals for describing the cardiac rhythm. To solve this problem, we first utilize various rPPG algorithms to capture pulse rhythms from different regions on the face video. We then investigate biomedical statistical methods to extract suitable features from each pulse signal. Due to the imprecision of video-extracted pulse signals, some traditional physiological features may lose their utility since they were originally proposed for ECG signals. Furthermore, some of them are very susceptible to the influence of noise. Thus, we propose a feature fusion algorithm to select and combine reasonable information from multiple physiological features, which aims to preserve the discriminability of detecting AF in the presence of the noise and outlier disturbances. The experimental results on a real-world database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing useful information for AF detection.",

      "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing plays a vital role in security systems including face payment systems and face recognition systems. Previous studies showed that live faces and presentation attacks have significant differences in both remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and texture information, we propose a generalized method exploiting both rPPG and texture features for face anti-spoofing task. First, multi-scale long-term statistical spectral (MS-LTSS) features with variant granularities are designed for representation of rPPG information. Second, a contextual patch-based convolutional neural network (CP-CNN) is used for extracting global-local and multi-level deep texture features simultaneously. Finally, weight summation strategy is employed for decision level fusion, which helps to generalize the method for not only print attack and replay attack but also mask attack. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on five databases, namely 3DMAD, HKBU-Mars VI, MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, and OULU-NPU, to show the superior results of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that the average heart rate (HR) can be measured from facial videos based on non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). However for many medical applications (e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF) detection) knowing only the average HR is not sufficient, and measuring precise rPPG signals from face for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is needed. Here we propose an rPPG measurement method, which is the first work to use deep spatio-temporal networks for reconstructing precise rPPG signals from raw facial videos. With the constraint of trend-consistency with ground truth pulse curves, our method is able to recover rPPG signals with accurate pulse peaks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and results demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance on both HR and HRV levels comparing to the state-of-the-art methods. We also achieve promising results of using reconstructed rPPG signals for AF detection and emotion recognition.",

Given a 4D data of face scans, we first compute its geometrical images, and then combine their correlated information in the proposed cross-domain image representations. The acquired set is then used to generate cross-domain dynamic images (CDI) via rank pooling that encapsulates facial deformations over time in terms of a single image. For the training phase, these CDIs are fed into an end-to-end deep learning model, and the resultant predictions collaborate over multi-views for performance gain in expression classification. Furthermore, we propose a 4D augmentation scheme that not only expands the training data scale but also introduces significant facial muscle movement patterns to improve the FER performance. Results from extensive experiments on the commonly used BU-4DFE dataset under widely adopted settings show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art 4D FER methods by achieving an accuracy of 96.5% indicating its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Emotions are central for human intelligence and should have a similar role in AI. When it comes to emotion recognition, however, analysis cues for robots were mostly limited to human facial expressions and speech. As an alternative important non-verbal communicative fashion, the body gesture is proved to be capable of conveying emotional information which should gain more attention. Inspired by recent researches on micro-expressions, in this paper, we try to explore a specific group of gestures which are spontaneously and unconsciously elicited by inner feelings. These gestures are different from common gestures for facilitating communications or to express feelings on ones own initiative and always ignored in our daily life. This kind of subtle body movements is known as `micro-gestures' (MGs). Work of interpreting the human hidden emotions via these specific gestural behaviors in unconstrained situations, however, is limited. It is because of an unclear correspondence between body movements and emotional states which need multidisciplinary efforts from computer science, psychology, and statistic researchers. To fill the gap, we built a novel Spontaneous Micro-Gesture (SMG) dataset containing 3,692 manually labeled gesture clips. The data collection from 40 participants was conducted through a story-telling game with two emotional state settings. In this paper, we explored the emotional gestures with a sign-based measurement. To verify the latent relationship between emotional states and MGs, we proposed a framework that encodes the objective gestures to a Bayesian network to infer the subjective emotional states. Our experimental results revealed that, most of the participants would do `micro-gestures' spontaneously to relieve their mental strains. We also carried out a human test on ordinary and trained people for comparison. The performance of both our framework and human beings was evaluated on 142 testing instances (71 for each emotional state) by subject-independent testing. To authors' best knowledge, this is the first presented MG dataset. Results showed that the proposed MG recognition method achieved promising performance. We also showed that MGs could be helpful cues for the recognition of hidden emotional states.",

With the constraint of trend-consistency with ground truth pulse\\ncurves, our method is able to recover rPPG signals with accurate pulse peaks.\\nComprehensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and results\\ndemonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance on both HR and HRV\\nlevels comparing to the state-of-the-art methods. We also achieve promising\\nresults of using reconstructed rPPG signals for AF detection and emotion\\nrecognition.\\n",

      "abstract": "Physiological signals, including heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and respiratory frequency (RF) are important indicators of our health, which are usually measured in clinical examinations. Traditional physiological signal measurement often involves contact sensors, which may be inconvenient or cause discomfort in long-term monitoring sessions. Recently, there were studies exploring remote HR measurement from facial videos, and several methods have been proposed. However, previous methods cannot be fairly compared, since they mostly used private, self-collected small datasets as there has been no public benchmark database for the evaluation. Besides, we haven't found any study that validates such methods for clinical applications yet, e.g., diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias/disease, which could be one major goal of this technology. In this paper, we introduce the Oulu Bio-Face (OBF) database as a benchmark set to fill in the blank. The OBF database includes large number of facial videos with simultaneously recorded reference physiological signals. The data were recorded both from healthy subjects and from patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common sustained and widespread cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Accuracy of HR, HRV and RF measured from OBF videos are provided as the baseline results for future evaluation. We also demonstrated that the video-extracted HRV features can achieve promising performance for AF detection, which has never been studied before. From a wider outlook, the remote technology may lead to convenient self-examination in mobile condition for earlier diagnosis of the arrhythmia.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are rapid, involuntary facial expressions which reveal emotions that people do not intend to show. Studying MEs is valuable as recognizing them has many important applications, particularly in forensic science and psychotherapy. However, analyzing spontaneous MEs is very challenging due to their short duration and low intensity. Automatic ME analysis includes two tasks: ME spotting and ME recognition. For ME spotting, previous studies have focused on posed rather than spontaneous videos. For ME recognition, the performance of previous studies is low. To address these challenges, we make the following contributions: (i)We propose the first method for spotting spontaneous MEs in long videos (by exploiting feature difference contrast). This method is training free and works on arbitrary unseen videos. (ii)We present an advanced ME recognition framework, which outperforms previous work by a large margin on two challenging spontaneous ME databases (SMIC and CASMEII). (iii)We propose the first automatic ME analysis system (MESR), which can spot and recognize MEs from spontaneous video data. Finally, we show our method outperforms humans in the ME recognition task by a large margin, and achieves comparable performance to humans at the very challenging task of spotting and then recognizing spontaneous MEs.",

      "abstract": "Face biometric systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Such attacks can be performed in many ways, including presenting a falsified image, video or 3D mask of a valid user. A widely used approach for differentiating genuine faces from fake ones has been to capture their inherent differences in (2D or 3D) texture using local descriptors. One limitation of these methods is that they may fail if an unseen attack type, e.g. a highly realistic 3D mask which resembles real skin texture, is used in spoofing. Here we propose a robust anti-spoofing method by detecting pulse from face videos. Based on the fact that a pulse signal exists in a real living face but not in any mask or print material, the method could be a generalized solution for face liveness detection. The proposed method is evaluated first on a 3D mask spoofing database 3DMAD to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting 3D mask attacks. More importantly, our cross-database experiment with high quality REAL-F masks shows that the pulse based method is able to detect even the previously unseen mask type whereas texture based methods fail to generalize beyond the development data. Finally, we propose a robust cascade system combining two complementary attack-specific spoof detectors, i.e. utilize pulse detection against print attacks and color texture analysis against video attacks.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies validated the feasibility of estimating heart rate from human faces in RGB video. However, test subjects are often recorded under controlled conditions, as illumination variations significantly affect the RGB-based heart rate estimation accuracy. Intel newly-announced low-cost RealSense 3D (RGBD) camera is becoming ubiquitous in laptops and mobile devices starting this year, opening the door to new and more robust computer vision. RealSense cameras produce RGB images with extra depth information inferred from a latent near-infrared (NIR) channel. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, that heart rate can be reliably estimated from RealSense near-infrared images. This enables illumination invariant heart rate estimation, extending the heart rate from video feasibility to low-light applications, such as night driving. With the (coming) ubiquitous presence of RealSense devices, the proposed method not only utilizes its near-infrared channel, designed originally to be hidden from consumers; but also exploits the associated depth information for improved robustness to head pose.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are rapid, involuntary facial expressions which reveal emotions that people do not intend to show. Studying MEs is valuable as recognizing them has many important applications, particularly in forensic science and psychotherapy. However, analyzing spontaneous MEs is very challenging due to their short duration and low intensity. Automatic ME analysis includes two tasks: ME spotting and ME recognition.For ME spotting, previous studies have focused on posed rather than spontaneous videos. For ME recognition, the performance of previous studies is low. To address these challenges, we make the following contributions: (i) We propose the first method for spotting spontaneous MEs in long videos (by exploiting feature difference contrast). This method is training free and works on arbitrary unseen videos. (ii) We present an advanced ME recognition framework, which outperforms previous work by a large margin on two challenging spontaneous ME databases (SMIC and CASMEII). (iii) We propose the first automatic ME analysis system (MESR), which can spot and recognize MEs from spontaneous video data. Finally, we show that our method achieves comparable performance to humans at this very challenging task, and outperforms humans in the ME recognition task by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are brief involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions and, thus, help detect lies. Because of their many promising applications, they have attracted the attention of researchers from various fields. Recent research reveals that two perceptual color spaces (CIELab and CIELuv) provide useful information for expression recognition. This paper is an extended version of our International Conference on Pattern Recognition paper, in which we propose a novel color space model, tensor independent color space (TICS), to help recognize micro-expressions. In this paper, we further show that CIELab and CIELuv are also helpful in recognizing micro-expressions, and we indicate why these three color spaces achieve better performance. A micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e., a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture and independent color components achieves a higher accuracy than does that of RGB. In addition, we define a set of regions of interests (ROIs) based on the facial action coding system and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. Experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performances for TICS, CIELab, and CIELuv are better than those for RGB or gray.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Micro-expression is a brief involuntary facial expression which reveals genuine emotions and helps detect lies. It intrigues psychologists and computer scientists&amp;#39; (especially on computer vision and pattern recognition) interests due to its promising applications in various fields. Recent research reveals that color may provide useful information for expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel color space model, Tensor Independent Color Space (TICS), for enhancing the performance of micro-expression recognition. An micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e. a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture in the independent color components can get higher accuracy than that in RGB. In addition, we define a set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. The experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performance in TICS is better than that in RGB or gray.&lt;/p&gt;",

Those methods work well on stationary subjects under well controlled conditions, but their performance significantly degrades if the videos are recorded under more challenging conditions, specifically when subjects' motions and illumination variations are involved. We propose a framework which utilizes face tracking and Normalized Least Mean Square adaptive filtering methods to counter their influences. We test our framework on a large difficult and public database MAHNOB-HCI and demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all previous methods. We also use our method for long term heart rate monitoring in a game evaluation scenario and achieve promising results.",

      "abstract": "A series of asymmetric membranes based on a trifluoromethylphenylated poly(ether ether ketone) (CF 3 -PEEK) were prepared using a dry–wet phase inversion method. To obtain the asymmetric membranes with defect-free skin, the type and concentration of internal nonsolvent and the evaporation time were carefully investigated. The cross-section of membranes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The gas separation performance of asymmetric membranes was tested in terms of gas permeabilities and selectivities for helium, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), oxygen (O 2 ), and nitrogen by the constant volume method. It was found that the permeabilities of asymmetric membranes were obviously higher than that of CF 3 -PEEK dense membrane. The membranes in series 2 showed higher permeability for each gas while the separability for gas pair CO 2 /O 2 increased from 3.78 to about 6 comparing with that of the dense membrane.",

      "abstract": "A robust automatic micro-expression recognition system would have broad applications in national safety, police interrogation, and clinical diagnosis. Developing such a system requires high quality databases with sufficient training samples which are currently not available. We reviewed the previously developed micro-expression databases and built an improved one (CASME II), with higher temporal resolution (200 fps) and spatial resolution (about 280×340 pixels on facial area). We elicited participants' facial expressions in a well-controlled laboratory environment and proper illumination (such as removing light flickering). Among nearly 3000 facial movements, 247 micro-expressions were selected for the database with action units (AUs) and emotions labeled. For baseline evaluation, LBP-TOP and SVM were employed respectively for feature extraction and classifier with the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method. The best performance is 63.41% for 5-class classification.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are short, involuntary facial expressions which reveal hidden emotions. Micro-expressions are important for understanding humans' deceitful behavior. Psychologists have been studying them since the 1960's. Currently the attention is elevated in both academic fields and in media. However, while general facial expression recognition (FER) has been intensively studied for years in computer vision, little research has been done in automatically analyzing micro-expressions. The biggest obstacle to date has been the lack of a suitable database. In this paper we present a novel Spontaneous Micro-expression Database SMIC, which includes 164 micro-expression video clips elicited from 16 participants. Micro-expression detection and recognition performance are provided as baselines. SMIC provides sufficient source material for comprehensive testing of automatic systems for analyzing micro-expressions, which has not been possible with any previously published database.",

The ionic conductivities of the anion exchange membranes were above 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature and the membrane with an IEC = 1.46 mequiv. g−1 attained an ion conductivity of 7.4 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 100 °C, which is higher than many reported results. The membrane series had low water uptake and excellent dimensional stability, even at the highest IEC values. In addition, the membranes were insoluble in organic solvents and concentrated alkaline solutions for many days, even under heating, suggesting their excellent stability. These combined data suggest that the membranes have potential to be used as anion exchange membranes for fuel cells applications.",

Firstly, the paper briefly reviewed the dynamic textures and the analysis method. The fire in the large place is complex and difficult to be detected. In this paper, the fire detecting method adapting dynamic textures in large place is adopted to monitor the fire in the large place on real-time. The model of doing dynamic textures of the fire image using optical flow is built and simulated. In this paper, four types fire images were analyzed with dynamic textures. And the criterion of detecting fire with dynamic textures was established.",

In this paper, emotion recognition by combining physiological signals and facial expressions was studied. Heart rate variability parameters, respiration frequency, and facial expressions were used to classify person's emotions while watching pictures with emotional content. Three classes were used for both valence and arousal. The preliminary results show that, over the proposed channels, detecting arousal seem to be easier compared to valence. While the classification performance of 54.5% was attained with arousal, only 38.0% of the samples were classified correctly in terms of valence. In future, additional modalities as well as feature selection will be utilized to improve the results.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown that the fusiform face area (FFA) in the human brain plays a key role in face perception. Recent studies have found that both the featural information of faces (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth) and the configural information of faces (i.e., spatial relation among features) are encoded in the FFA. However, little is known about whether the featural information is encoded independent of or combined with the configural information in the FFA. Here we used multi-voxel pattern analysis to examine holistic representation of faces in the FFA by correlating spatial patterns of activation with behavioral performance in discriminating face parts with face configurations either present or absent. Behaviorally, the absence of face configurations (versus presence) impaired discrimination of face parts, suggesting a holistic representation in the brain. Neurally, spatial patterns of activation in the FFA were more similar among correct than incorrect trials only when face parts were presented in a veridical face configuration. In contrast, spatial patterns of activation in the occipital face area, as well as the object-selective lateral occipital complex, were more similar among correct than incorrect trials regardless of the presence of veridical face configurations. This finding suggests that in the FFA faces are represented not on the basis of individual parts but in terms of the whole that emerges from the parts.",

To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no previous work that successfully recognises spontaneous facial micro-expressions. In this paper we show how a temporal interpolation model together with the first comprehensive spontaneous micro-expression corpus enable us to accurately recognise these very short expressions. We designed an induced emotion suppression experiment to collect the new corpus using a high-speed camera. The system is the first to recognise spontaneous facial micro-expressions and achieves very promising results that compare favourably with the human micro-expression detection accuracy.",

We propose a new spatiotemporal local texture descriptor (CLBP-TOP) that outperforms other descriptors. We demonstrate that our temporal interpolation and visual/near-infrared fusion methods improve the differentiation performance. Finally, we propose a new generic facial expression recognition framework that subdivides the facial expression recognition problem into a cascade of smaller tasks that are simpler to tackle. The system is the first to differentiate spontaneous from posed facial expressions with a realistic corpus and achieves promising results.",

In this paper, with advantages of dynamic programming, we presents a stereo matching algorithm using double dynamic programming with correlation of row and column, which uses improved adaptive support-weight approach and energy minimization model to solve the optimization problem. In the solving process, different constructed values of data items given based on characters of variation in the column direction using row dynamic programming and the values of smoothness item in the column direction, to reduce apparent defective stripes, are used to get the final result using column dynamic programming. Experimental results used Middlebury database show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the overall matching error rates and apparent defective stripes and get a better stereo matching effect.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a new model for suppressing jammers to GPS receivers is proposed. In the model, circular antenna arrays combining minimum norm (min-norm) and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) algorithms have been used for signal anti-jamming. Six GPS signals' and two jammers' original incident direction were assumed respectively. The simulation was performed with a variation of the power of the two jammers and the element number of the circular antenna array. The simulation result indicates that by utilizing this new signal suppression model, nulls depths assigned to the jammer reach -238dBW when the number of element of circular antenna array is assumed to be 30. It also indicates that the stronger power of the jammer, the deeper nulls depths can be assigned with this new signal processing structure.",
