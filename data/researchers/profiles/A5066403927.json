      "abstract": "Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.",

In this project, we utilize the CO2 generated from the Allam cycle as feedstock for a newly envisioned industrial complex dedicated to producing renewable hydrocarbons. The industrial complex (FAAR) comprises four subsystems: (i) a Fischer–Tropsch synthesis plant (FTSP), (ii) an alkaline water electrolysis plant (AWEP), (iii) an Allam power cycle plant (APCP), and (iv) a reverse water-gas shift plant (RWGSP). Through effective material, heat, and power integration, the FAAR complex, utilizing 57.1% renewable energy for its electricity needs, can poly-generate sustainable hydrocarbons (C1–C30), pure hydrogen, and oxygen with near-zero emissions from natural gas and water. Economic analysis indicates strong financial performance of the development, with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 18%, a discounted payback period of 8.7 years, and a profitability index of 2.39. The complex has been validated through rigorous modeling and simulation using Aspen Plus version 14, including sensitivity analysis.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, YouTube, and Reddit have become rich sources of data for understanding public sentiment and emotional trends. This paper presents a hybrid machine learning approach for the analysis and prediction of emotions in social media content. This approach focuses on analyzing Englishlanguage text related to the COVID-19 pandemic collected from popular social media, i.e., X (formerly Twitter), and classifying them into seven emotion categories: “Happy,” “Sad,” “Angry,” “Annoyed,” “Fear,” “Surprise,” and “Neutral”. It integrates Lexical-based algorithm, Conventional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Hyperparameter Tuning technique to achieve better performance. To address the imbalance of X (formerly Twitter) data, we adopt oversampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and CV-SMOTE, ensuring effective learning across all seven emotion categories. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach outperforms traditional models, making it a promising solution for large-scale emotion prediction tasks in dynamic social media environments.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, subtle facial expressions that reveal concealed emotions, offering key behavioral cues for social interaction. Characterized by short duration, low intensity, and spontaneity, MEs have been mostly studied through subjective coding, lacking objective, quantitative indicators. This paper explores ME characteristics using facial electromyography (EMG), analyzing data from 147 macro-expressions (MaEs) and 233 MEs collected from 35 participants. First, regarding external characteristics, we demonstrate that MEs are short in duration and low in intensity. Precisely, we proposed an EMG-based indicator, the percentage of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC%), to measure ME intensity. Moreover, we provided precise interval estimations of ME intensity and duration, with MVC% ranging from 7% to 9.2% and the duration ranging from 307 ms to 327 ms. This research facilitates fine-grained ME quantification. Second, regarding the internal characteristics, we confirm that MEs are less controllable and consciously recognized compared to MaEs, as shown by participants' responses and self-reports. This study provides a theoretical basis for research on ME mechanisms and real-life applications. Third, building on our previous work, we present CASMEMG, the first public ME database including EMG signals, providing a robust foundation for studying micro-expression mechanisms and movement dynamics through physiological signals.",

      "abstract": "Mental health is a global issue in modern society. Social media has become an integral part of people's lives, where users share moments and feelings through posts rich in emotional content. Social content has been widely used to study mental health issues. Social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter provide anonymous space for users to discuss stigmatic topics and self-report personal issues. In this paper, we introduced a comprehensive evaluation of several large language models (LLMs) for mental health analysis based on social media data, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), robustly optimized BERT (RoBERT), MentalBERT, Microsoft/Phi-2, and MentalLLAMa, etc. We discussed their capabilities to categorize mental health conditions and provided insights into mental health analysis based on the corpus collected from social forums. Our experiments were conducted on the Reddit Suicide Watch and Mental Health (SWMH) data collected from several Reddit mental health communities. The results suggest that fine-tuning and instruction fine-tuning have significant potential for advancing mental health analysis using LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements critical for detecting lies, drawing growing interest in psychology and computer science. However, annotating ME can burden human coders with excessive time commitment and overwhelming information that compromises coding reliability and efficiency. Such difficulties in data annotation also led to the small sample size problem and hindered the development of ME analysis. Specifically, our psychological research highlights the complexities involved in human annotation of key frames. To facilitate the annotating process of ME, we proposed the Micro-Expression Key Frame Inference (ME-KFI) problem, aiming to identify MEs’ temporal locations from a single frame, reducing manual annotation effort. We propose a Micro-Expression Contrastive Identification Annotation (MECIA) method as a solution to ME-KFI, including three modules: a contrastive module, an identification module, and an annotation module, corresponding to the three steps of manual annotation. The network’s outputs infer the key frame of ME clips. MECIA demonstrates superior performance over random baselines on SAMM and CAS(ME)<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> databases and maintains comparable recognition accuracy with ground-truth clips.",

The challenges associated with obtaining samples suitable for single-crystal diffraction, coupled with the limitations inherent in classical structure determination methods that primarily utilize powder diffraction for most polycrystalline materials, underscore an urgent need to develop alternative approaches for elucidating the structures of commonly encountered crystalline compounds. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence-directed leapfrog model capable of accurately determining the structures of both organic and inorganic-organic hybrid crystalline solids through direct analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data. This model not only offers a comprehensive solution that effectively circumvents issues related to insoluble challenges in conventional structure solution methodologies but also demonstrates applicability to crystal structures across all conceivable space groups. Furthermore, it exhibits notable compatibility with routine powder diffraction data typically generated by standard instruments, featuring rapid data collection and normal resolution levels.",

      "abstract": "Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary spontaneous movements of the face that typically appear in high-stakes situations where a person attempts to conceal a certain emotion from being known. A decade after the inception of the widely used CASME II and SMIC datasets, research in computational analysis of MEs has now advanced toward new pathways, exploring problems crucial to model generalization and real-world practicality. It is often challenging to design robust algorithms or models for spotting micro-expressions due to the high variability across diverse cultural backgrounds. Also, treating spotting and recognition as separate tasks is undesirable when handling long-spanning videos under realistic settings. This Grand Challenge comprises two distinct tracks: the Cross-Cultural Spotting (CCS) track, and the Spot-Then-Recognize (STR) track. All participating solutions submitted their results to a leaderboard, and several submissions performed well surpassing their respective baseline results. More details are available at: https://megc2024.github.io.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Identifying pediatric eye diseases at an early stage is a worldwide issue. Traditional screening procedures depend on hospitals and ophthalmologists, which are expensive and time-consuming. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to assess children’s eye conditions from mobile photographs could facilitate convenient and early identification of eye disorders in a home setting. OBJECTIVE To develop an AI model to identify myopia, strabismus, and ptosis using mobile photographs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital from October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, and included children who were diagnosed with myopia, strabismus, or ptosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A deep learning–based model was developed to identify myopia, strabismus, and ptosis. The performance of the model was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC), positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), positive likelihood ratios (P-LR), negative likelihood ratios (N-LR), and the F1-score. GradCAM++ was utilized to visually and analytically assess the impact of each region on the model. A sex subgroup analysis and an age subgroup analysis were performed to validate the model’s generalizability. RESULTS A total of 1419 images obtained from 476 patients (225 female [47.27%]; 299 [62.82%] aged between 6 and 12 years) were used to build the model. Among them, 946 monocular images were used to identify myopia and ptosis, and 473 binocular images were used to identify strabismus. The model demonstrated good sensitivity in detecting myopia (0.84 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87]), strabismus (0.73 [95% CI, 0.70-0.77]), and ptosis (0.85 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87]). The model showed comparable performance in identifying eye disorders in both female and male children during sex subgroup analysis. There were differences in identifying eye disorders among different age subgroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, the AI model demonstrated strong performance in accurately identifying myopia, strabismus, and ptosis using only smartphone images. These results suggest that such a model could facilitate the early detection of pediatric eye diseases in a convenient manner at home.",

      "abstract": "Plant microbiota are an important factor impacting plant cadmium (Cd) uptake. However, little is known about how plant microbiota affects the Cd uptake by plants under the influence of microplastics (MPs) with different particle sizes. In this study, bacterial structure and assembly in the rhizosphere and endosphere in pakchoi were analyzed by amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes under the influence of different particle sizes of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) combined with Cd treatments. Results showed that there were no significant differences observed in the shoot endophytes among different treatments. However, compared to Cd treatment, larger-sized PS-MPs (2 and 20 μm) significantly increased community diversity and altered the structural composition of rhizosphere bacteria and root endophytes, while smaller-sized PS-MPs (0.2 μm) did not. Under the treatment of larger-sized PS-MPs, the niche breadth of rhizosphere bacteria and root endophytes were significantly increased. And larger-sized PS-MPs also maintained stability and complexity of bacterial co-occurrence networks, while smaller-sized PS-MPs reduced them. Furthermore, compared to Cd treatment, the addition of larger particle size PS-MPs decreased the proportion of homogeneous section, while increased the proportion of drift in root endophytic bacterial community assembly. The role of larger-sized MPs in the community assembly of rhizosphere bacteria was opposite. Using random forest and structural equation models, the study found that larger-sized PS-MPs can promote the colonization of specific bacterial taxa, such as Brevundimonas, AKAU4049, SWB02, Ellin6055, Porphyrobacter, Sphingorhabdus, Rhodobacter, Erythrobacter, Devosia and some other bacteria belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, in the rhizosphere and root endosphere. The colonization of these taxa can may induce the formation of biofilms in the roots, immobilize heavy metals through oxidation processes, and promote plant growth, thereby reducing Cd uptake by pakchoi. The findings of this study provide important insights into the microbial mechanisms underlying the influence of MPs with different particle sizes on plant Cd uptake.",

      "abstract": "We conducted an experiment of planting a dead cow and a metal-framed cage with cameras on the 1629 m deep sea floor off the southeast coast of Hainan Island in the northwestern South China Sea, using ROV diving and setting up a video camera on the cage to observe animals who came to eat the bait. The deep-sea cameras captured footage of eight Pacific sleeper sharks (Somniosus pacificus) swimming and feeding around the dead cow. To our knowledge, this is the first time the occurrence of such a shark species has been reported in the South China Sea. Eight individuals were differentiated based on the characteristic differences displayed in the images, with lengths of 1.9 to 5.1 m estimated. The video camera also recorded the predators’ behavior of tearing at the dead cow on the seabed. It was discovered that Pacific sleeper sharks are not strictly solitary and exhibit queue-feeding behavior. This study is significant as it documents a record of a data-scarce shark species, for which little information is available in the literature. It also documents an expansion of the species’ known habitat from the north Pacific Ocean into the South China Sea. Such sharks diving into the deep sea to predate on dead animals also suggests that occurrences of large chunks of dead organic bodies falling onto the deep sea might have been more frequent than we previously thought in the South China Sea. The findings have implications for understanding the geographic connectivity of large swimming animals between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean and provide scientific evidence for formulating conservation and management strategies for sharks and other large animals in the oceans.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies proposed above-the-neck gestures for people with upper-body motor impairments interacting with mobile devices without finger touch, resulting in an appropriate user-defined gesture set. However, many gestures involve sustaining eyelids in closed or open states for a period. This is challenging for people with dystonia, who have difficulty sustaining and intermitting muscle contractions. Meanwhile, other facial parts, such as the tongue and nose, can also be used to alleviate the sustained use of eyes in the interaction. Consequently, we conducted a user study inviting 16 individuals with dystonia to design gestures based on facial muscle movements for 26 common smartphone commands. We collected 416 user-defined head gestures involving facial features and shoulders. Finally, we obtained the preferred gestures set for individuals with dystonia. Participants preferred to make the gestures with their heads and use unnoticeable gestures. Our findings provide valuable references for the universal design of natural interaction technology.",

      "abstract": "An efficient and precise time-frequency analysis method for real-time ocean bottom seismometer (RTOBS) data in the South China Sea (SCS) is presented. Overcoming the limitations of conventional methods, the method involves temporal segmentation, unique frequency octaves, and Fourier transforms to generate power spectral density (PSD) and probability density function profiles. The method demonstrates superior precision, computational efficiency, and full-bandwidth (0 to Nyquist) capability compared to traditional techniques, as validated through theoretical and empirical evaluations. Applied to SCS RTOBS data, it unveils temporal PSD variations, shedding light on underwater noise sources like earthquakes, offshore blasting, ship-induced disturbances, and tidal effects. Establishing background noise levels in the SCS supports noise source categorization and ocean environment monitoring. Furthermore, comparing onshore and offshore seismic stations advances interdisciplinary research, fostering a comprehensive understanding of acoustics and seismology in the region.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Denoising is a critical step in signal processing. We develop a method for random noise reduction in active source seismic data using spectrum reconstruction. Two methods are developed for modifying the observed data’s amplitude spectrum: one substitutes it with the source wavelet’s amplitude spectrum, whereas the other involves multiplying the source wavelet’s amplitude spectrum with the observed data’s amplitude spectrum. By reconstructing the modified amplitude spectrum while preserving the observed data’s phase spectrum, noise suppression is achieved. Extensive testing with theoretical models, synthetic shot gathers, and field data indicate a notable improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) compared with the traditional band-pass filtering method. This method proves particularly effective for enhancing the S/N in the context of active source wide-angle seismic data used in offshore structural studies, eliminating the need for data segmentation based on offset, and thereby improving processing efficiency. Our method relies solely on a single complete cycle of the source wavelet, making it a purely data-driven solution. It has broad applications in processing active source or controlled source data with consistent source wavelets, including but not limited to seismic exploration, acoustic detection, and signal denoising in various ground-penetrating radars used on Mars, the moon, and earth.",

      "abstract": "The seafloor observation network can perform all-weather, long-term, continuous, real-time, and in-situ observation of the ocean by combining various observation methods including cabled seafloor nodes and self-contained nodes, as well as mobile platforms, where reliable and long-term high-speed underwater wireless communication becomes an essential requirement. Recently, underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has emerged as a highly promising solution and is rapidly becoming a research hotspot for meeting this requirement. In this article, we demonstrate an experiment with the application of a high-speed UWOC system for the deep sea seafloor observation network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first long-term real-time deep-sea UWOC link with bitrate as high as 125 Mb/s. Between two nodes of 30 m distance and at a depth of 1650 m, two-way Ethernet UWOC links are achieved with 125 Mb/s direction-adjustable green light link and 6.25 Mb/s nonline-of-sight (NLOS) blue light link. High quality video transmission of 8K 30 FPS and 4K 120 FPS are achieved through a high-speed 125 Mb/s green light link, with 100 percent peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) agreement, showing the capability of transmitting high-quality lossless videos. Our 30-day long-term measurement results show that the BER performance of both 125 Mb/s and 6.25 Mb/s links is lower than 10– <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup> , proving the stability and reliability of this UWOC system at a depth of 1650 m. By measuring the light attenuation of a deep-sea water sample, the maximum transmission distance for the green and blue light links are estimated to be 117.7 and 128.3 m with geometry loss, which can be extended to 231.6 and 337.5 m without geometry loss. With the first long-term and real-time UWOC system in the deep sea, we believe this demonstration can provide valuable experience for further UWOC studies and converged ocean observation networking with cabled and cable-less observation platforms.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a portable wireless transmission system for the multi-channel acquisition of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. Because EMG signals have great application value in psychotherapy and human–computer interaction, this system is designed to acquire reliable, real-time facial-muscle-movement signals. Electrodes placed on the surface of a facial-muscle source can inhibit facial-muscle movement due to weight, size, etc., and we propose to solve this problem by placing the electrodes at the periphery of the face to acquire the signals. The multi-channel approach allows this system to detect muscle activity in 16 regions simultaneously. Wireless transmission (Wi-Fi) technology is employed to increase the flexibility of portable applications. The sampling rate is 1 KHz and the resolution is 24 bit. To verify the reliability and practicality of this system, we carried out a comparison with a commercial device and achieved a correlation coefficient of more than 70% on the comparison metrics. Next, to test the system’s utility, we placed 16 electrodes around the face for the recognition of five facial movements. Three classifiers, random forest, support vector machine (SVM) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), were used for the recognition of the five facial movements, in which random forest proved to be practical by achieving a classification accuracy of 91.79%. It is also demonstrated that electrodes placed around the face can still achieve good recognition of facial movements, making the landing of wearable EMG signal-acquisition devices more feasible.",

      "abstract": "Parabens (PBs), a class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are extensively used as additives in personal care products (PCPs); however, distinguishing between endogenous and exogenous contamination from PCPs in hair remains a challenge. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the levels, distribution patterns, impact factors, and sources of PBs in 119 human hair samples collected from Changchun, northeast China. The detection rates of methylparaben (MeP), propylparaben (PrP), and ethylparaben (EtP) in hair samples were found to be 100%. The concentration of PBs in hair followed the order of MeP (57.48 ng/g) > PrP (46.40 ng/g) > EtP (6.80 ng/g). The concentration of PrP in female hair was significantly higher (65.38 ng/g) than that observed in male hair (7.82 ng/g) (p < 0.05). The levels of excretion rates of MeP (ER<sub>MeP</sub>) and excretion rates of PrP (ER<sub>PrP</sub>) in the hair-dying samples (ER<sub>MeP</sub>: 17.89 ng/day; ER<sub>PrP</sub>: 14.15 ng/day) were found to be 2.52 and 2.40 times higher, respectively, compared to the non-hair-dying samples (ER<sub>MeP</sub>: 7.09 ng/day; ER<sub>PrP</sub>: 6.05 ng/day). However, the system exposure dosage (SED) results revealed that although hair dyes exhibited higher PBs, human exposure was found to be lower than certain PCPs. The results of the correlation analysis revealed that toner, face cream, body lotion, and hair conditioner were identified as the primary sources of PBs in male hair. Furthermore, the human exposure resulting from the utilization of female hair dye and serum exhibited a positive correlation with hair ER<sub>MeP</sub> and ER<sub>PrP</sub> levels, indicating in the screening of samples, excluding hair samples using hair dye and haircare essential oil can effectively avoid the interference caused by exogenous contamination from PCPs.",

      "abstract": "Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. Unfortunately, the small sample problem severely limits the automation of ME analysis. Furthermore, due to the weak and transient nature of MEs, it is difficult for models to distinguish it from other types of facial actions. Therefore, ME in long videos is a challenging task, and the current performance cannot meet the practical application requirements. Addressing these issues, this challenge focuses on ME and the macro-expression (MaE) spotting task. This year, in order to evaluate algorithms' performance more fairly, based on CAS(ME)2, SAMM Long Videos, SMIC-E-long, CAS(ME)3 and 4DME, we build an unseen cross-cultural long-video test set. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard with a baseline result.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are facial movements that are extremely short and not easily detected, which often reflect the genuine emotions of individuals. Micro-expressions are important cues for understanding real human emotions and can be used for non-contact, non-perceptual deception detection, or abnormal emotion recognition. It has broad application prospects in national security, judicial practice, health prevention, and clinical practice. However, micro-expression feature extraction and learning are highly challenging because they are typically short in duration, low intensity, and have local facial asymmetry. In addition, the intelligent micro-expression analysis combined with deep learning technology is also plagued by the problem of relatively small data samples. Not only is micro-expression elicitation very difficult, micro-expression annotation is also very time-consuming and laborious. More importantly, the micro-expression generation mechanism is not yet clear, which shackles the application of micro-expressions in real scenarios. FME'23 is the inaugural workshop in this area of research, with the aim of promoting interactions between researchers and scholars from within this niche area of research. This year we hope to discuss the growing ethical conversations when using face data, and how we can come to a consensus on micro-expression standards within affective computing.",

      "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents our design of teaching computer programming for middle and high school students during an one-week Summer camp for the past five years, with an interruption in the Summer of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many researchers believe that good Summer camps can improve many students' educational and career development outcomes. Teachers and administrators are increasingly promoting Summer camp opportunities for introducing programming skills to middle and high school students. The motivation of our program is to offer hands-on projects for middle and high school students to increase their interests and knowledge in computing to meet the growing demand. Like some Summer coding camps, we picked Scratch as the programming language (designed and offered for free by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for the students to learn important mathematical and computer programming concepts. In addition, the students learn how to think and reason creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively, while also having fun during the one-week Summer camp. For the students already familiar with Scratch, the instructor exposed students to basic concepts of Java programming language, such as Java virtual machine, computer memory, data representation, primitive data types, casting, arithmetic, and relational operators, as well as the assignment, selection and printing statements. This article presents our findings from Summer camps organized in 2018 and 2022. Our conclusion is that all students showed a better understanding of programming concepts and confidence in computing. In the upcoming paper sections, we will describe details about how we made one-week camps to be unique compared to other similar camps. One element of our own approach is to teach in an effective and innovative using an interactive teaching approach. For example, when we designed the lecture notes, we imagine that we are students taking for the first time a computer programming course. In addition, we designed simple programming exercises for the students to solve immediately. The instructors and Teaching Assistants promptly checked the solution and award the students with stars for completing the work. This environment was very well received because it was viewed as a student collegiate competition instead of a race against time. Besides learning about computer programming, we adopted during Summer camps several strategies like those enumerated earlier to enrich our camps, as well as social events, career and professional development, and academic exposure. Our findings indicate that these additional activities proved to be beneficial to our students attending the Summer camps.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions may occur in high-stake situations when people attempt to conceal or suppress their true feelings. Nowadays, intelligent micro-expression analysis has long been focused on videos captured under constrained laboratory conditions. This is due to the relatively small number of publicly available datasets. Moreover, micro-expression characteristics are subtle and brief, and thus very susceptible to interference from external factors and difficult to capture. In particular, head movement is unavoidable in unconstrained scenarios, making micro-expression spotting highly challenging. This paper proposes a simple yet effective method for avoiding the interference of head movement on micro-expression spotting in natural scenarios by considering three-dimensional space. In particular, based on the head pose, which can be mapped to two-dimensional vectors (translations and rotations) for representation, long and complex videos could be divided into short video segments that basically exclude head movement interference. Following that, segmented micro-expression spotting is realized based on an effective short-segment-based micro-expression spotting algorithm. Experimental results on in-the-wild databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in avoiding head movement interference. Additionally, due to the simplicity of this method, it creates opportunities for spotting micro-expressions in real-world scenarios, possibly even in real-time. Furthermore, it helps alleviate the small sample size problem in micro-expression analysis by boosting the spotting performance in massive unlabeled videos.",

Using robotics is a great way to introduce engineering and computing concepts in a fun and interactive way. There are several popular educational robotic kits available, e.g., Lego EV3, VEX robotics, SparkFun Inventor's Kit, Raspberry Pi, SeaPerch underwater robotics, etc. All these robotics are great options for creating fun and engaging projects that encourage creativity and problem-solving skills for middle school and high school students. While they all have their unique features and benefits, there are some similarities and differences that can help with choosing the right tool for a specific group of students at different ages and skill levels. The motivation of this study is to provide detailed information and a comparative study of utilizing several popular educational robotics to teach engineering and computing concepts to middle school and high school students for those who are interested in organizing similar programs at their institutions to prompt the effort to increase participation in engineering and computing fields. Studies have proved that by introducing engineering and computing concepts early on, students can develop an interest in these fields and pursue them in the future.",

      "abstract": "A novel adsorbent was synthesized for the capture of heavy metals mixture in water by encapsulating hydroxyapatite-modified wood ear mushroom sticks biochar in calcium alginate beads (CA-HAPMB). The surface structure and adsorption mechanism of the CA-HAPMB were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Under different conditions, CA-HAPMB for Cd2+ and Pb2+ were investigated for their adsorption properties in water and their competition. The adsorption capacities of Cd2+ and Pb2+ on the aerogel spheres reached 302.2 mg g−1 (2.69 mmol g−1) and 564.5 mg g−1 (2.73 mmol g−1), respectively (based on Langmuir). The aerogel spheres are easier to collect than biochar materials. The results show that CA-HAPMB composite aerogel spheres have a good application prospect in capturing heavy metal ions from water.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (MER) is challenging due to the difficulty of capturing the instantaneous and subtle motion changes of micro-expressions (MEs). Early works based on hand-crafted features extracted from prior knowledge showed some promising results, but have recently been replaced by deep learning methods based on the attention mechanism. However, with limited ME sample sizes, features extracted by these methods lack discriminative ME representations, in yet-to-be improved MER performance. This paper proposes the Dual-branch Attention Network (Dual-ATME) for MER to address the problem of ineffective single-scale features representing MEs. Specifically, Dual-ATME consists of two components: Hand-crafted Attention Region Selection (HARS) and Automated Attention Region Selection (AARS). HARS uses prior knowledge to manually extract features from regions of interest (ROIs). Meanwhile, AARS is based on attention mechanisms and extracts hidden information from data automatically. Finally, through similarity comparison and feature fusion, the dual-scale features could be used to learn ME representations effectively. Experiments on spontaneous ME datasets (including CASME II, SAMM, SMIC) and their composite dataset, MEGC2019-CD, showed that Dual-ATME achieves better, or more competitive, performance than the state-of-the-art MER methods.",

      "abstract": "Microexpression recognition (MER) has wide applications in the financial industry. MER is based on machine learning or deep learning algorithm to establish a classification model to capture the subtle expression changes of the face from the video. We propose a hybrid intelligent marketing scheme (HIMS). In the HIMS, firstly, the system automatically recommends products to customers according to the Big data analysis results, while monitoring the emotional changes of customers in real-time. When the system detects that customers have negative emotions, the marketing scheme turns to manual mode. The key step of HIMS is to monitor the emotional changes of customers through the MER model. The advantage of HIMS is that it can reduce marketing costs while ensuring a larger marketing scale, higher marketing efficiency, and lower complaint rate. Based on the real marketing scenario, we deduce the profit function and give the analysis results. The experimental results show that under multiple parameter configurations, the profit of HIMS is greater than that of the Big data marketing scheme with an increase of 8.8-12.8 times. For products with more customer complaints, this advantage becomes significant and is insensitive to commodity value and has strong robustness.",

      "abstract": "Facial expression spotting is the preliminary step for micro- and macro-expression analysis. The task of reliably spotting such expressions in video sequences is currently unsolved. Current best systems depend upon optical flow methods to extract regional motion features, before categorisation of that motion into a specific class of facial movement. Optical flow is susceptible to drift error, which introduces a serious problem for motions with long-term dependencies, such as high frame-rate macro-expression. We propose a purely deep learning solution which, rather than tracking frame differential motion, compares via a convolutional model, each frame with two temporally local reference frames. Reference frames are sampled according to calculated micro- and macro-expression duration. As baseline for MEGC2021 using leave-one-subject-out evaluation method, we show that our solution performed better in a high frame-rate (200 fps) SAMM long videos dataset (SAMM-LV) than a low frame-rate (30 fps) (CAS(ME)2) dataset. We introduce a new unseen dataset for MEGC2022 challenge (MEGC2022-testSet) and achieves F1-Score of 0.1531 as baseline result.",

Unfortunately, the small sample problem severely limits the automation of ME analysis. Furthermore, due to the brief and subtle nature of ME, ME spotting is a challenging task, and the performance is still not satisfactory yet. This challenge focuses on two tasks, i.e., the micro- and macro-expression spotting task, and the ME Generation task.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are facial movements that are extremely short and not easily detected, which often reflect the genuine emotions of individuals. Micro-expressions are important cues for understanding real human emotions and can be used for non-contact non-perceptual deception detection, or abnormal emotion recognition. It has broad application prospects in national security, judicial practice, health prevention, clinical practice, etc. However, micro-expression feature extraction and learning are highly challenging because micro-expressions have the characteristics of short duration, low intensity, and local asymmetry. In addition, the intelligent micro-expression analysis combined with deep learning technology is also plagued by the problem of small samples. Not only is micro-expression elicitation very difficult, micro-expression annotation is also very time-consuming and laborious. More importantly, the micro-expression generation mechanism is not yet clear, which shackles the application of micro-expressions in real scenarios. FME'22 is the inaugural workshop in this area of research, with the aim of promoting interactions between researchers and scholars from within this niche area of research and also including those from broader, general areas of expression and psychology research.

      "abstract": "This innovative Practice Full Paper establishes two one-week summer camps to introduce fundamental engineering and programming concepts to middle-school and high-school students using the SparkFun Inventor’s Kit, Scratch, Makers Empire 3D Design Software, and Java. The SparkFun Inventor’s Kit is a great way to introduce electronics and programming concepts to students who have little, no previous programming, or circuit construction experience. During the one-week summer camp, students were introduced to the Arduino-based SparkFun Inventor’s Kit as the hardware platform, along with Arduino’s Integrated Design Environment (IDE) for programming. Scratch was used to teach fundamental programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, strings, conditional statements, and loops. The motivation of our program is to offer hands-on engineering and programming experiences for middle-school and high-school students to increase their interests and knowledge in engineering and computing to promote student participation to meet the growing demand. Our program is unique in several ways: First, we developed several hands-on projects to integrate topics related to engineering and computing to help students develop and build skills of critical thinking, problem-solving, and invention. Second, we used several teaching tools, e.g., SparkFun Inventor’s Kit, Scratch, Makers Empire 3D Design Software, and Java to enrich students’ learning experience, while other programs used only one of those teaching tools. Third, we adopted several strategies to enrich our program, such as social encouragement, academic exposure, career perception, and social learning, which have shown beneficial effects on student learning in the literature to improve learning outcomes. Fourth, we also provided students the opportunity of a campus tour to help students get familiar with college life. Fifth, we organized team-building activities outside the classroom to build skills of effective collaboration and communication. Participants obtained a better understanding of principle programming, engineering concepts, and confidence in engineering and computing. The assessment results showed a significant increase in knowledge and interest in engineering and computing. This paper introduces the detailed information about our program organization, coordination, core curriculum design, and program assessment for organizing similar summer camps at other institutions and further prompts the effort to increase participation in engineering and computing fields.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are facial expressions that individuals reveal when trying to hide their genuine emotions. It has potential applications in areas such as lie detection and national security. It is generally believed that micro-expressions have three essential characteristics: short duration, low intensity, and local asymmetry. Most previous studies have investigated micro-expressions based on the characteristic of short duration. To our knowledge, no empirical studies have been conducted on the low-intensity characteristic. In this paper, we use facial EMG for the first time to study the characteristic of low intensity for micro-expression. In our experiment, micro-expressions were elicited from subjects and simultaneously collected their facial EMG through the second-generation micro-expression elicitation paradigm. We collected and annotated 33 macro-expressions and 48 micro-expressions. By comparing the two indicators of EMG :(1) the percentage of apex value in maximum voluntary contraction (MVC%) and (2) the area under EMG signal curve (integrated EMG, iEMG), we found that the MVC% and iEMG of micro-expression were significantly smaller than that of macro-expression. The result demonstrates that the intensity of micro-expression is significantly smaller than that of macro-expression.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression (ME) is an extremely quick and uncontrollable facial movement that lasts for 40–200 ms and reveals thoughts and feelings that an individual attempts to cover up. Though much more difficult to detect and recognize, ME recognition is similar to macro-expression recognition in that it is influenced by facial features. Previous studies suggested that facial attractiveness could influence facial expression recognition processing. However, it remains unclear whether facial attractiveness could also influence ME recognition. Addressing this issue, this study tested 38 participants with two ME recognition tasks in a static condition or dynamically. Three different MEs (positive, neutral, and negative) at two attractiveness levels (attractive, unattractive). The results showed that participants recognized MEs on attractive faces much quicker than on unattractive ones, and there was a significant interaction between ME and facial attractiveness. Furthermore, attractive happy faces were recognized faster in both the static and the dynamic conditions, highlighting the happiness superiority effect. Therefore, our results provided the first evidence that facial attractiveness could influence ME recognition in a static condition or dynamically.",

      "abstract": "PM2.5 can deposit and partially dissolve in the pulmonary region. In order to be consistent with the reality of the pulmonary region and avoid overestimating the inhalation human health risk, the bioaccessibility of PM2.5 heavy metals and the deposition fraction (DF) urgently needs to be considered. This paper simulates the bioaccessibility of PM2.5 heavy metals in acidic intracellular and neutral extracellular deposition environments by simulating lung fluid. The multipath particle dosimetry model was used to simulate DF of PM2.5. According to the exposure assessment method of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the inhalation exposure dose threshold was calculated, and the human health risk with different inhalation exposure doses was compared. The bioaccessibility of heavy metals is 12.1–36.2%. The total DF of PM2.5 in adults was higher than that in children, and children were higher than adults in the pulmonary region, and gradually decreased with age. The inhalation exposure dose threshold is 0.04–14.2 mg·kg−1·day−1 for the non-carcinogenic exposure dose and 0.007–0.043 mg·kg−1·day−1 for the carcinogenic exposure dose. Cd and Pb in PM2.5 in the study area have a non-carcinogenic risk to human health (hazard index &lt; 1), and Cd has no or a potential carcinogenic risk to human health. A revised inhalation health risk assessment may avoid overestimation.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has dramatically changed peoples' lives over the past two years. The goal of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University for the USA, Brazil, India, and Iran between January 23, 2020 and January 21, 2022, and to develop prediction models for the new daily cases and new daily deaths related to COVID-19 for these four countries. Two supervised learning techniques, i.e., Holt's double exponential smoothing and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA), were developed to generate the prediction models for each country. Based on the results of this project, both Holt's double exponential smoothing and ARIMA techniques can produce good models that fit the data well for all four countries and help to predict the patterns of the spread of COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "A micro-expression is a subtle, local and brief facial movement. It can reveal the genuine emotions that a person tries to conceal and is considered an important clue for lie detection. The micro-expression research has attracted much attention due to its promising applications in various fields. However, due to the short duration and low intensity of micro-expression movements, micro-expression recognition faces great challenges, and the accuracy still demands improvement. To improve the efficiency of micro-expression feature extraction, inspired by the psychological study of attentional resource allocation for micro-expression cognition, we propose a deep local-holistic network method for micro-expression recognition. Our proposed algorithm consists of two sub-networks. The first is a Hierarchical Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (HCRNN), which extracts the local and abundant spatio-temporal micro-expression features. The second is a Robust principal-component-analysis-based recurrent neural network (RPRNN), which extracts global and sparse features with micro-expression-specific representations. The extracted effective features are employed for micro-expression recognition through the fusion of sub-networks. We evaluate the proposed method on combined databases consisting of the four most commonly used databases, i.e., CASME, CASME II, CAS(ME)2, and SAMM. The experimental results show that our method achieves a reasonably good performance.",

      "abstract": "Our poster covers the organization, curriculum design, and assessment of two summer camps we organized in Summer 2021 to teach middle school students fundamental programming concepts to increase their knowledge and interests in computer science. We designed several hands-on projects using the SparkFun Inventor's Kit, Scratch, and Makers Empire 3D Design Software. Scratch was used to teach fundamental programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, strings, conditional statements, and loops. The SparkFun Inventor's Kit provides a powerful and in-depth programming experience for middle school students. The Mission to Mars Design Challenge Activity utilized Makers Empire 3D Design Software and Scratch and allowed students to explore and determine the specific needs of a mission to Mars while challenging them to brainstorm, design, and create an invention or new tool. Those hands-on programming experiences helped students to develop and build creative confidence, design thinking skills, and problem-solving skills. Our program assessment results showed that camp participants increased their knowledge and interests in subjects related to programming and computer science. Our poster provides detailed information about organizing similar summer camps at other institutions to increase general participation in computer science.",

      "abstract": "Due to their toxicity, non-biodegradability, and biological amplification in the food chain, heavy metal accumulation in humans via the consumption of fishes has become a problem. In this study, we analyzed the concentrations of six trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) in 12 marine fish species collected from Liaodong Bay, China, from 2015 to 2020, to understand the pollution status of the bay and evaluate the impact of fish consumption on human health. In addition, 5 fish species with the potential to serve as bioindicators of metal contamination were identified. In general, the average concentrations were Zn &amp;gt; Pb ≈ Cr &amp;gt; Ni ≈ Cu &amp;gt; Cd. There were significant differences in the concentrations in the muscle tissues of fish with different feeding strategies. The total target hazard quotient values of some fish were greater than 1 in 2015, suggesting that people were susceptible to high health risks. The year 2017 had the lowest values, which suggests that metal pollution in Liaodong Bay may have been decreasing at that time. Monitoring of metal concentrations in marine fish from Liaodong Bay warrants more study.",

      "abstract": "Effective unit maintenance is critically important for the front-end crude transfer process (FCTP) to ensure production reliability and safe operations in refineries. It should be prioritized based on risk ratings of all maintenance tasks and constrained by the availability of various maintenance resources, such as budget, manpower, equipment, and supplies, as well as having minimal impact on the normal production of refineries. In this paper, a new methodology for the simultaneous production and maintenance scheduling for refinery FCTP systems has been developed. It can generate optimal schedules for both crude movement and unit maintenance plans with considerations of dynamic risk management and resource availability constraints. As such, a new multiobjective and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (M-MINLP) model has been developed to minimize the total FCTP operating cost, as well as to minimize the total risk from all maintenance tasks. The scheduling model can handle multiunit maintenance assignments with optimal determination of when to isolate a unit to perform its maintenance and how to resume its service after maintenance under the satisfaction of all strict constraints for crude storage, blending and movements, unit maintenance requirements, and resource limitations. The efficacy of the development has been demonstrated by multiple large-scale case studies.",

      "abstract": "Facial expressions are a vital way for humans to show their perceived emotions. It is convenient for detecting and recognizing expressions or micro-expressions by annotating a lot of data in deep learning. However, the study of video-based expressions or micro-expressions requires that coders have professional knowledge and be familiar with action unit (AU) coding, leading to considerable difficulties. This paper aims to alleviate this situation. We deconstruct facial muscle movements from the motor cortex and systematically sort out the relationship among facial muscles, AU, and emotion to make more people understand coding from the basic principles: We derived the relationship between AU and emotion based on a data-driven analysis of 5,000 images from the RAF-AU database, along with the experience of professional coders. We discussed the complex facial motor cortical network system that generates facial movement properties, detailing the facial nucleus and the motor system associated with facial expressions. The supporting physiological theory for AU labeling of emotions is obtained by adding facial muscle movements patterns. We present the detailed process of emotion labeling and the detection and recognition of AU. Based on the above research, the video's coding of spontaneous expressions and micro-expressions is concluded and prospected.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression (ME) is a significant non-verbal communication clue that reveals one person's genuine emotional state. The development of micro-expression analysis (MEA) has just gained attention in the last decade. However, the small sample size problem constrains the use of deep learning on MEA. Besides, ME samples distribute in six different databases, leading to database bias. Moreover, the ME database development is complicated. In this article, we introduce a large-scale spontaneous ME database: CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup>. The contribution of this article is summarized as follows: (1) CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> offers around 80 hours of videos with over 8,000,000 frames, including manually labeled 1,109 MEs and 3,490 macro-expressions. Such a large sample size allows effective MEA method validation while avoiding database bias. (2) Inspired by psychological experiments, CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> provides the depth information as an additional modality unprecedentedly, contributing to multi-modal MEA. (3) For the first time, CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> elicits ME with high ecological validity using the mock crime paradigm, along with physiological and voice signals, contributing to practical MEA. (4) Besides, CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> provides 1,508 unlabeled videos with more than 4,000,000 frames, i.e., a data platform for unsupervised MEA methods. (5) Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of depth information by the proposed depth flow algorithm and RGB-D information.",

      "abstract": "Facial micro-expressions (FMEs) are involuntary facial movements that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but tries to suppress or repress the facial expression and usually occur in high-risk situations. Thus, FMEs are very short in duration, an important feature that distinguishes them from ordinary facial expressions. And MEs are considered to be one of the most valuable cues for complex human emotion understanding and lie detection. Since 2014, the computational analysis and automation of MEs have been an emerging area of face research. The workshop will explore various dimensions of the human mind through emotion understanding and FME analysis, as well as extended research based on multi modal approaches.",

Moreover, a large amount of annotated data facilitates the performance of deep learning for the spotting and recognition of expressions or micro-expressions. However, the study of video-based expressions or micro-expressions requires coders to have expertise while also familiar with action unit (AU) coding. This paper systematically sorts out the relationship between facial muscles and AU to make more people understand AU coding from the principle. For this purpose, we have made a brief guide to get started as quickly as possible for the beginner to code.",

The goal of this project is to utilize advanced machine learning models to analyze the global COVID-19 data and predict the future patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 data were downloaded from John Hopkins University and Worldometer between January 23, 2020, and April 26, 2021. Advanced machine learning techniques including polynomial regression, support vector regression, and Holt's double exponential smoothing were developed to predict the daily cases for three countries: the USA, India, and Brazil. Based on our experimental results, the USA and Brazil were predicted to decline in the total number of daily cases. However, the daily COVID-19 cases in India were predicted to increases as a new variant of the virus was massively spreading throughout the country. In conclusion, advanced machine learning techniques were efficient and effective to analyze and predict the global COVID-19 data. Our models show good prediction results for all three countries.

The purpose of offering this camp is to increase female participation in the computing and engineering fields to close the gender gap. This summer camp focused its efforts on teaching incoming 8 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> -grade female students the fundamentals of programming skills and engineering concepts. We taught our camp participants to use Raspberry Pi to build systems that explore fundamental programming and engineering concepts and develop engineering skills. Raspberry Pi provides a general programming environment with numerous interfaces to allow direct control of the hardware. This paper describes the organization, coordination, and core curriculum instructions that integrate programming and engineering concepts taught in each hands-on session and discusses the program assessment results. Our program assessment results showed that all camp participant cohorts increased their knowledge and interests in computing and engineering. This paper intends to provide all the information needed to host similar summer camps at other institutions, and further prompt the effort to increase female participation in computing and engineering fields.",

      "abstract": "In this study, PM2.5 was analyzed for heavy metals at two sites in industrial northeast China to determine their sources and human health risks during heating and non-heating periods. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model determined sources, and US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and entropy weight methods were used to assess human health risk. PM2.5 heavy metal concentrations were higher in the heating period than in the non-heating period. In the heating period, coal combustion (59.64%) was the primary heavy metal source at Huagong Hospitals, and the contribution rates of industrial emissions and traffic emissions were 21.06% and 19.30%, respectively. Industrial emissions (42.14%) were the primary source at Xinqu Park, and the contribution rates of coal combustion and traffic emissions were 34.03% and 23.83%, respectively. During the non-heating period, coal combustion (45.29%) and industrial emissions 45.29% and 44.59%, respectively, were the primary sources at Huagong Hospital, and the traffic emissions were 10.12%. Industrial emissions (43.64%) were the primary sources at Xinqu Park, where the coal combustion and traffic emissions were 25.35% and 31.00%, respectively. In the heating period, PM2.5 heavy metals at Xinqu Park had noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, and the hazard index of children (5.74) was higher than that of adult males (5.28) and females (4.49). However, adult males and females had the highest lifetime carcinogenic risk (1.38 × 10−3 and 1.17 × 10−3) than children (3.00 × 10−4). The traditional USEPA and entropy weight methods both produced reasonable results. However, when there is a difference between the two methods, the entropy weight method is recommended to assess noncarcinogenic health risks.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Improving the total-factor carbon emission efficiency of the power industry (TCEPI) is of great significance for realizing the low-carbon development of power industry and promoting the transformation of society to green development. Considering the technological heterogeneity of different regions in China, this paper adopted the Meta-frontier Global Malmquist-Luenberger (MGML) index to measure TCEPI in 30 provinces from 2003 to 2017, and then analyzed the dynamic evolution and regional differences of TCEPI. Finally, the two-step system GMM model was used to explore the influencing factors of TCEPI. The results showed that: (1) During the survey period, the average annual growth rate of TCEPI in China was 4.2%, and average values of TCEPI in all provinces were greater than 1. The innovation effect was the key to TCEPI growth, while the catch-up effect and leading effect were not significant. (2) There was obvious technological heterogeneity in the three regions of China. TCEPI showed a decreasing trend from the western to eastern and central regions, with average annual growth rates of 5.69%, 3.66% and 2.89%, respectively, and the driving factors of each region were different. Moreover, the technology gap among the regions was constantly narrowing. (3) Both the economic development level and the R&amp;D level had played a significant role in promoting TCEPI, while the intensity of power consumption had hindered the rise of TCEPI to a large extent. Based on the conclusions of this article, relevant policy recommendations were put forward to improve TCEPI in China.",

      "abstract": "SARM1 regulates axonal degeneration through its NAD-metabolizing activity and is a drug target for neurodegenerative disorders. We designed and synthesized fluorescent conjugates of styryl derivative with pyridine to serve as substrates of SARM1, which exhibited large red shifts after conversion. With the conjugates, SARM1 activation was visualized in live cells following elevation of endogenous NMN or treatment with a cell-permeant NMN-analog. In neurons, imaging documented mouse SARM1 activation preceded vincristine-induced axonal degeneration by hours. Library screening identified a derivative of nisoldipine (NSDP) as a covalent inhibitor of SARM1 that reacted with the cysteines, especially Cys311 in its ARM domain and blocked its NMN-activation, protecting axons from degeneration. The Cryo-EM structure showed that SARM1 was locked into an inactive conformation by the inhibitor, uncovering a potential neuroprotective mechanism of dihydropyridines.",

We designed and synthesized fluorescent conjugates of styryl derivative with pyridine to serve as substrates of SARM1, which exhibited large red shifts after conversion. With the conjugates, SARM1 activation was visualized in live cells following elevation of endogenous NMN or treatment with a cell-permeant NMN-analog. In neurons, imaging documented mouse SARM1 activation preceded vincristine-induced axonal degeneration by hours. Library screening identified a derivative of nisoldipine (NSDP) as a covalent inhibitor of SARM1 that reacted with the cysteines, especially Cys311 in its ARM domain and blocked its NMN-activation, protecting axons from degeneration. The Cryo-EM structure showed that SARM1 was locked into an inactive conformation by the inhibitor, uncovering a potential neuroprotective mechanism of dihydropyridines. Introduction Axon degeneration (AxD) occurs in most neurodegenerative disorders (Coleman and Höke, 2020). Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif–containing 1 (SARM1) acts as a main effector in this process (Osterloh et al., 2012) and its depletion significantly attenuates AxD (Geisler et al., 2016; Osterloh et al., 2012; Turkiew et al., 2017). SARM1 controls AxD through its enzymatic activity (Essuman et al., 2017). It is self-inhibitory and is activated by nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (Zhao et al., 2019), resulting in depletion of the intracellular NAD-pool (Essuman et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019). However, recent studies suggest that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) itself is an inhibitor of SARM1 activation and the balance between NMN and NAD controls the activation of SARM1 (Figley et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020; Sporny et al., 2020). It should be noted that SARM1 is not just a simple NADase activated to deplete the cellular NAD. We have documented that SARM1 is a multifunctional enzyme with properties similar to CD38, a universal signaling enzyme possessing not only NADase activity but also catalyzing both the cyclization of NAD to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and the exchange of nicotinamide in NADP with nicotinic acid to produce nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (Zhao et al., 2019). Both cADPR and NAADP are messengers regulating calcium mobilization in the endoplasmic reticulum and the endo-lysosomes, respectively (reviewed in Galione, 1994; Lee, 2012; Lee and Zhao, 2019). The catalytic similarities and its ubiquitous presence in non-neuronal cells suggest that SARM1 may be a calcium signaling enzyme as well. Since SARM1 is important in axon degeneration and potentially other physiological processes as well, we thus aim to design and synthesize probes for visualizing SARM1 activation in live cells and to screen drug library for potent inhibitors. Results Probe design, synthesis, and characterization We focused on its base-exchange reaction for designing specific probes for SARM1 and had shown that pyridyl derivatives can readily serve as substrates (Graeff et al., 2006; Lee and Aarhus, 1997). We thus conjugated various styryl derivatives to pyridine to produce a series of conjugates (PCs) as fluorescent probes for SARM1 activity (Figure 1A). We reasoned that conjugating the electron-rich styryl derivative with pyridine should provide a donor-π-acceptor framework (Pawlicki et al., 2009; Figure 1B). The positive charge of the pyridinium moiety of the product should delocalize over the conjugated π-system and lead to fluorescence changes (Figure 1A). Pyridine conjugates (PC1-9, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 11A) were synthesized using the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling strategy with yields ranging from 33.5 to 85.0%. The synthesis details are in the 'Materials and methods' section and product characterizations are shown in Figure 1—figure supplements 2–10.

As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 12, significant shifts in UV-vis spectra were observed in the reactions with the oxygenated derivatives (PC5-8, O-series), but not the nitrogenated derivatives (PC1–4, N-series), nor PC9 with diene as linker. The emission spectra of the reactive O-series showed steady increase as the reaction progressed (Figure 1—figure supplement 13, spectra; Figure 1D, kinetics; Figure 1—figure supplement 11C, initial rate), with PC6, the chemical structure shown in Figure 1C, exhibiting the largest fluorescence increase (Figure 1D). The time course study for the reaction involving PC6 showed that the UV absorption decreases at 330 nm but increases at 400 nm with an isosbestic point at 350 nm (Figure 1—figure supplement 12; Figure 1E). Corresponding to the absorbance change was the red shift in the fluorescence spectra, from the emission maximum at 430 nm of PC6 to 520 nm of PAD6 (Figure 1E). The conversion of PC6 to the exchange product, PAD6, was verified by purifying it using HPLC and characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Figure 1F). The remarkably large spectral changes are anticipated from our design, as the pyridine ring becomes positively charged after its exchange into NAD (Figure 1F, inlet), a much stronger electron acceptor in the D−π−A structure, thereby increasing intramolecular charge transfer and shifting the emission maximum by over 100 nm. The conversion-induced spectral changes were consistent with the spectra of the HPLC-purified products, PAD6 (Figure 1G). The observed spectral changes showed a linear dependence on NMN, with as low as 10 μM being effective (Figure 1H), confirming that SARM1 is an auto-inhibitory enzyme activated by NMN (Zhao et al., 2019). The fluorescence increase was also proportional to the amount of NMN-activated SARM1 (Figure 1I), with a detection limit of 48 ng/mL. As an in vitro assay for SARM1, PC6 provides more than 100-fold higher sensitivity over other commonly used probes, such as εNAD, NGD, or NHD (Figure 1J). In addition to sensitivity, PC6 also shows exquisite selectivity toward SARM1 versus CD38 and N. crassa NADase (Graeff et al., 1994). All three possess NADase activity as detected by εNAD (Figure 1K), but only SARM1 could produce large fluorescence increase with PC6. Imaging SARM1 activation in live cells PC6 was added to HEK293 cells overexpressing either wildtype SARM1 or the enzymatically inactive mutant, E642A (Essuman et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Figure 2A). Green fluorescence was clearly seen evenly distributed in the whole cells in the wildtype, but not in the mutant cells (Figure 2B), indicating active SARM1 was required. Intracellular production of PAD6 was confirmed in extracts of wildtype but not the E642A cells (Figure 2C). CZ-48, a cell-permeant mimetic of NMN and activator of SARM1 (Zhao et al., 2019), dramatically increased the PAD6 fluorescence (Figure 2B, right column) and none in E642A-cells. These results indicate that PC6 is cell-permeant and can be exchanged into the cytosolic NAD by the activated SARM1 to produce PAD6 having a large red shift in fluorescence. PAD6 was also cell-impermeant because of its charged ADP-ribose moiety and accumulated in the cytosol, greatly increased its detection sensitivity in live cells.

CZ-48 activated the endogenous SARM1 and produced increase of cytosolic PAD6 signal (Figure 2D, upper right), but none in the SARM1-knockout cells (Figure 2D, right lower), confirming the specificity of PC6 for SARM1. An HEK293 cell line carrying doxycycline (Dox)-inducible SARM1 (Zhao et al., 2019) was used to further substantiate that the PAD6 fluorescence was derived from SARM1 activity. Without induction, only basal SARM1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) with minimal activity was detected (Figure 2E, green dots), while activated by CZ-48, resulting in increase in PAD6-fluorescence (orange triangles). Induction of SARM1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) produced minimal signal also (Figure 2E, purple squares), confirming SARM1 is auto-inhibitory. With CZ-48, both the basal and the induced SARM1 were activated, resulting in the largest signal (Figure 2E, black triangles). In SARM1-knockout cells, no signal was detected (Figure 2D, SARM1-KO; Figure 2E, blue and red dots). Endogenous NMN can be increased by ablating NMN-adenylytransferase (NMNAT1) (Zhao et al., 2019) to activate SARM1. Correspondingly, NMNAT1 knockout in HEK293T cells also resulted in increasing PAD6 fluorescence (Figure 2F) in a time-dependent manner (Figure 2G). Consistent with the in vitro results showing that PC6 is highly selective for SARM1 over CD38 in live cells, cells expressing either wildtype or Type III mutant CD38 (Liu et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2012) did not show PAD6-signal after 48 hr incubation with PC6 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B), even though the expressed enzymes readily increased cellular cADPR (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Imaging SARM1 activation during AxD Vincristine (VCR)-induced AxD in peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of chemotherapy (Essuman et al., 2017) and is thought to be due to SARM1-activation (Gerdts et al., 2013). Mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were infected with lentivirus carrying TdTomato for visualizing the axons (Figure 3A and C, orange), and with either a non-targeting (Figure 3A) or Sarm1-specific shRNA (Figure 3C). In the non-targeting group, VCR elevated PAD6-fluorescence (Figure 3A, green), indicating activation of SARM1, by as early as 4–8 hr and reaching a maximum by 16 hr (Figure 3A and D, blue). AxD started at about 20 hr (Figure 3F, blue; Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), temporally consistent with a causal role for SARM1. Another measure of SARM1 activation is the elevation of cellular cADPR (Zhao et al., 2019), which occurred (Figure 3E, blue) by 12 hr, peaking at 24 hr. Neurons not treated with VCR showed neither SARM1-activation nor AxD (Figure 3A,D,E,F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, CTRL). Figure 3 with 1 supplement see all Download asset Open asset SARM1 activation in mouse DRG upon vincristine treatment. (A, C) Confocal imaging of SARM1 activation in DRG neuronal axons. The neurons were infected with virus expressing TdTomato to provide easy imaging of the axons.

CZ-48 induced SARM1-activation more rapidly (Figure 3A and D, red) and elevated cADPR higher (Figure 3E, red), confirming its direct action. Intriguingly, CZ-48 did not induce massive AxD as VCR (Figure 3F, CZ-48; S5A). These results indicate SARM1-activation is a necessary and causal factor, but not a sufficient one for AxD. Other critical factors and downstream events of microtubular dysfunction might contribute to the degeneration. Dehydronitrosonisodipine (dHNN) is an inhibitor of SARM1 activation Another prompt application of PC6 is library screening for inhibitors of SARM1. The feasibility was verified by measuring the IC50 of a reported inhibitor of SARM1, nicotinamide (Nam) (Essuman et al., 2017). The measured IC50 value of Nam was around 140 μM, which is consistent with the reported value (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Next, we utilized this assay to screen for SARM1 inhibitors. NMN-activated SARM1 was incubated with drugs of the library (Figure 4A) and its activity measured with PC6 in the presence of NAD (Figure 1). Out of 2015 drugs, 34 had more than 80% inhibition (Figure 4B), which were further tested for inhibition of the SARM1-NADase activity using HPLC. Figure 4C shows the plot the IC50-values of these drugs measured with both the PC6 and the NADase/HPLC assays. Twenty-four drugs are in the middle sector, indicating they inhibited both reactions similarly. Two inhibited the PC6 activity five fold less than the NADase (Figure 4C, left sector), and eight in the right sector (seven have IC50s higher than 40 μM) inhibited NADase less than the base-exchange. These remarkable differences underscore the importance of using more than one assay for drug screening (see Discussion).

Peculiarly, its inhibition of SARM1 varied widely among batches. Investigations indicated the active compound was not NSDP but its derivative. Figure 4D shows fresh NSDP had an IC50-value of about 150 μM (squares), but its potency increased 75-fold after exposure to UV (Figure 4D, triangles, IC50 = 2.36 ± 0.3 μM). Also, fresh NSDP had an HPLC-elution peak at 12.2 min (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), but was completely converted by UV to a compound having a peak at 9.8 min that strongly inhibited SARM1 (Figure 4E, red). HRMS showed that the active compound had a mass of 370.15205 Da (Figure 4E, inset) identical to a known derivative of NSDP, dehydronitrosonisoldipine (dHNN) (Marinkovic et al., 2003). The HPLC-elution profile of the active compound was also the same as dHNN (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, purple line and green dash). Indeed, authentic dHNN was active and could not be further activated by UV (Figure 4F, red line and dash), which also indicates that it is photostable. Another derivative of NSDP, dehydronisoldipine (dHN, elution peak at 8.7 min, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), showed no inhibition before or after UV (Figure 4F, black line and dash), indicating that the nitroso group is essential for the effect. dHNN inhibits SARM1 and AxD by covalently modifying cysteines The dHNN-induced inhibition of SARM1 was irreversible by washing (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, red bars), while that by Nam was reversible.

      "abstract": "Unlike the conventional facial expressions, micro-expressions are involuntary and transient facial expressions capable of revealing the genuine emotions that people attempt to hide. Therefore, they can provide important information in a broad range of applications such as lie detection, criminal detection, etc. Since micro-expressions are transient and of low intensity, however, their detection and recognition is difficult and relies heavily on expert experiences. Due to its intrinsic particularity and complexity, video-based micro-expression analysis is attractive but challenging, and has recently become an active area of research. Although there have been numerous developments in this area, thus far there has been no comprehensive survey that provides researchers with a systematic overview of these developments with a unified evaluation. Accordingly, in this survey paper, we first highlight the key differences between macro- and micro-expressions, then use these differences to guide our research survey of video-based micro-expression analysis in a cascaded structure, encompassing the neuropsychological basis, datasets, features, spotting algorithms, recognition algorithms, applications and evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches. For each aspect, the basic techniques, advanced developments and major challenges are addressed and discussed. Furthermore, after considering the limitations of existing micro-expression datasets, we present and release a new dataset - called micro-and-macro expression warehouse (MMEW) - containing more video samples and more labeled emotion types. We then perform a unified comparison of representative methods on CAS(ME) <sup>2</sup> for spotting, and on MMEW and SAMM for recognition, respectively. Finally, some potential future research directions are explored and outlined.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression spotting is a fundamental step in the micro-expression analysis. This paper proposes a novel network based convolutional neural network (CNN) for spotting multi-scale spontaneous micro-expression intervals in long videos. We named the network as Micro-Expression Spotting Network (MESNet). It is composed of three modules. The first module is a 2+1D Spatiotemporal Convolutional Network, which uses 2D convolution to extract spatial features and 1D convolution to extract temporal features. The second module is a Clip Proposal Network, which gives some proposed micro-expression clips. The last module is a Classification Regression Network, which classifies the proposed clips to micro-expression or not, and further regresses their temporal boundaries. We also propose a novel evaluation metric for spotting micro-expression. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the two long video datasets: CAS(ME)<sup>2</sup> and SAMM, and the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation is used to evaluate the spotting performance. Results show that the proposed MESNet effectively enhances the F1-score metric. And comparative results show the proposed MESNet has achieved a good performance, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially in the SAMM dataset.",

In this paper, a comprehensive study to characterize the sloshing phenomenon for an offshore 3D vessel has been performed. The study integrates the computational fluid dynamics for rigorous sloshing simulations, the setup and measurement for a pilot-scale experimental testbed for simulation validation, as well as the employment of an artificial neural network method for effective sloshing impact prediction. Based on this comprehensive study, the sloshing impacts such as the maximum height of the free surface, the average cross-sectional pressure, and the maximum forces on the vessel wall have been systematically studied under various parameter changes of liquid filling level, frequency of the imposed waves, and amplitudes of different sea-state conditions. This study demonstrates its efficacy in characterizing and predicting general sloshing impacts, which would be helpful for future industrial applications.",

Both macro-and micro-expression intervals in CAS(ME) <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and SAMM Long Videos are spotted by employing the method of Main Directional Maximal Difference Analysis (MDMD). The MDMD method uses the magnitude maximal difference in the main direction of optical flow features to spot facial movements. The single-frame prediction results of the original MDMD method are post-processed into reasonable video intervals. The metric F1-scores of baseline results are evaluated: for CAS(ME) <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> , the F1-scores are 0.1196 and 0.0082 for macro-and micro-expressions respectively, and the overall F1-score is 0.0376; for SAMM Long Videos, the F1-scores are 0.0629 and 0.0364 for macro-and micro-expressions respectively, and the overall F1-score is 0.0445.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to construct a spotting framework automatically. It is still a great challenge to spot micro-expression(ME) intervals accurately due to short duration, low intensity, and shaking. Under the uncontrolled condition, the transformation is caused by head shaking. In order to remove the global movement caused by head shaking, we propose a simple yet effective method to disentangle local movement vector from the global optical flow field by the estimation of mean optical flow in the nose region. After preprocessing, we extract the completed specific pattern(SP) of ME in each region of interest(ROI). The pattern consists of two sub-patterns: magnitude and angle. However, influenced by frame rate and different intensities of micro- and macro- expressions, we propose to use a multi-scale filter to improve the ability to spot both micro- and macro-expressions. The spotting result performed on $CAS(ME)^{2}$ and SAMM shows that our proposed method outperforms the basline method.",

      "abstract": "The recent emergence of automatic facial micro-expression analysis has attracted a lot of attention in the last five years. Compared to the advances made in micro-expression recognition, the task of micro-expression spotting from long videos is tremendously in need of more effective methods. This paper summarises the 3rd Facial Micro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC 2020) held in conjunction with the 15th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2020. In this workshop, we propose a new challenge of spotting both macro- and micro-expressions from long videos, to spur the community to develop new techniques for micro-expression spotting and also to extend facial micro-expression analysis to more complex real-world scenarios where micro-expressions are likely to be intertwined among normal expressions. In this paper, we outline the evaluation protocols for the challenge task, and describe the datasets involved. Then, we summarize the methods from the accepted challenge papers, present the comparison and analysis of results, as well as future directions.",

      "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Full Paper discusses a STEM academy that used SeaPerch and Scratch as engaging hands-on approaches to teach seventh grade middle school girls engineering skills, scientific principles, and programming concepts to increase their knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Adding diversity to the STEM workforce and increasing enrollment in STEM degrees is critical for fulfilling the needs of our modern economy. Today, many organizations/institutions are preparing future workers for the modern workforce by implementing summer camps/academies to engage students in STEM disciplines at a young age. Exposing young students to the critical thinking and reasoning skills that are intrinsic to STEM disciplines can help to alleviate or even combat the decline of students in STEM careers. We have developed an academy to demonstrate STEM concepts to 7th grade girls. Our STEM academy differs from others in several ways: First, it was for 7th grade girls only, creating a non-competitive social learning opportunity, to improve female participation. Second, we hired female instructors and invited female professionals from local industries to assist the academy by serving as mentors and role models for the participants. Third, it introduced STEM concepts and principles to the girls. Fourth, it adopted social learning, e.g., buddy system, to help the girls to learn better. A formal assessment of the 2018 academy found that the academy's participants experienced a significant increase in knowledge and interest in STEM. This paper describes the organization, coordination, content, and assessment of the STEM academy. It describes how the academy was organized and taught, which includes a brief description of the instructional materials, the concepts taught in each hands-on session, how the academy was assessed, the assessment results, the first-year experience of conducting the STEM academy, and lessons learned. This paper provides all the information needed for others to host similar academies and motivate the effort to increase female participation in STEM careers.",

      "abstract": "The exposure to combinations of heavy metals can affect the genes of vegetables and heavy metals would accumulate in vegetables and thereby indirectly affecting human health. Exploring the links between genetic changes and phenotypic changes of carrot under the combined pollution of Cd and Cu is of great significance for studying the mechanism of heavy metal pollution. Therefore, this study examined the effects of mixtures of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) on physiological measures (malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, and antioxidant enzyme) and expression of growth-related genes (gibberellin gene, carotene gene, and glycogene) in carrot under greenhouse cultivation. The results showed in the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu at higher concentration, the MDA content increased significantly (p < 0.05), whereas the proline content was not significantly different from those in the control. In the mixed treatments with high Cd concentrations, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower than that in the control (p < 0.05); whereas the activity of peroxidase (POD) increased to different degrees compared to the control. In the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu, compared with the control, the expression of the gibberellin gene was downregulated from 1.97 to 20.35 times (not including the 0.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Cd and 20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Cu mixture, the expression of gibberellin gene in this treatment was upregulated 1.29 times), which lead to decreases in the length and dry weight of carrots. The expression of the carotene gene in mixed treatments downregulated more than that in single treatments, which could reduce the ability of carrots to resist oxidative damage, as suggested by the significant increase in the MDA content. In the addition with mixtures of Cd and Cu, compared with the control, the expression of the glycogene was downregulated by 1.42-59.40 times, which can cause a significant reduction in the sugar content in carrots and possibly further reduce their ability to resist heavy metal damage. A cluster analysis showed that in the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu, the plant phenotype was affected first, and then with increases in the added concentration, the expression of genes was also affected. In summary, in the additions with mixtures of Cd and Cu, plants were damaged as Cd and Cu concentrations increased.",

Efficient clustering algorithms and implementation techniques are keys to cope with the scalability and performance requirements of big data analysis. This paper introduces the design and implementation of a density-based clustering algorithm that can deal with big data efficiently and effectively. We present a parallel Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) clustering algorithm using the k-dimensional tree (k-d tree) to reduce search time to improve efficiency. The proposed algorithm is implemented in a distributed environment using the Spark framework. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated through a case study involving four data sets, Bristol Crime Stats, 911 call, Complex9, and TLC Trip datasets.",

      "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Full Paper discusses a coding/programming academy that used games and robotic programming as engaging hands-on approaches to teach 6 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> grade (the first grade in secondary education in USA) females coding/programming concepts to increase their knowledge and interest in computer science. Careers in computer science continue to grow, but fewer women than men are even considering these careers. Increasing participation of women in coding/programming is necessary to meet the growing demand for computing professionals to develop a diverse workforce. Today, many organizations are implementing programming coding/programming academies/camps that attempt to engage students in computer science, at an early age, by exposing them to fun and interesting computer science skills in coding/programming. We have developed a coding/programming academy that uses educational robotics and hands-on game applications to demonstrate computing concepts to young females. To address pressing equity issues of the lack of females in computer science careers, the goal of this summer coding/programming academy was to educate and empower young females, at an early age, to discover computer science careers, which has been one of the first attempts to establish a coding/programming academy for females in our region. Our coding/programming academy differs from others in several ways. First, it was for 6 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> -grade females only, to take advantage of preferences of noncompetitive and social learning opportunities, in order to improve female participation. Second, we hired female instructors and invited female professionals from local industries to assist the academy by serving as mentors. Third, it introduced both robotic and game coding/programming to the females. Fourth, it adopted social learning, e.g., pair programming. A formal assessment of the 2018 academy found that the academy's female participants experienced a significant increase in knowledge and interest in computer science. This paper describes the organization, coordination, content, and assessment of the coding/programming academy. It describes how the academy was organized and taught, which includes a brief description of the instructional materials, the concepts taught in each hands-on session, how the academy was assessed and the assessment results, and the first-year experience of conducting the coding/programming academy, and lessons learned. The intent of this paper is to provide all the information needed for others to host similar academies and further prompt the effort to increase female participation in computer science careers.",

In this paper, a time-window based MINLP (mixed-integer nonlinear programming) model has been developed for the simultaneous planning of berth and yard allocation problems at container-vessel oriented ports. It can simultaneously optimize the spatial berthing schedule of each vessel as well as container transshipment schedule at the port yard, so as to minimize the overall port operating cost subject to various port resource limits and operating constraints. A detailed case study has also been utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed model.",

      "abstract": "A typical front-end crude supply process of refineries encompasses many units, such as vessels, port-side storage tanks, long-distance pipeline, refinery-side charging tanks, and crude distillation units. In reality, the performance of these units will inevitably decay; thus, unit maintenance plans should be well integrated with normal crude movement schedules. In this paper, a novel methodology has been proposed to dynamically and simultaneously determine the optimal schedule of crude movement and unit maintenance operations. Specifically, both proactive scheduling for multiple preventive maintenance tasks and reactive scheduling for emergent corrective maintenance tasks are systematically integrated. Accordingly, the developed mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model will optimize the operation schedule for the front-end crude supply process via minimizing the total operating cost during the scheduling time horizon. Meanwhile, it can also determine the optimal unit maintenance schedule, which will identify the best opportunities of not only isolating units from process system to perform maintenance but also resuming their services after maintenance. The model can simultaneously handle multiple unit maintenance tasks while satisfying all strict constraints for crude transferring, storing, blending, and processing operations. The efficacy of the developed methodology and the MINLP model has been demonstrated through various case studies.",

      "abstract": "Ocean bottom electromagnetometer (OBEM) is used for picking and recording electromagnetic signals on seafloor. However, most of them are large, heavy, costly and low operational efficiency. Therefore, to improve these problems, we have developed a compact ocean bottom electromagnetometer. In order to reduce cost and deck space, we integrated acquisition system, acoustic transducer, fluxgate sensor and batteries into a 17-inch glass sphere; assembled other components including anchor, electrodes and electric dipole arms outside. An ARM Cortex-M microcontroller is used as the control unit. By combining with other low power design, the total power consumption is only 400mW at 250Hz sampling frequency, the lithium batteries can supply OBEM running for more than 3 months. In order to evaluate the reliability of OBEM, a number of ocean experiments were carried out in South China Sea, Mariana Trench and Antarctic Peninsula. All instruments were recovered successfully and high quality magnetotelluric data was obtained.",

      "abstract": "Because of the complexity and diversity of marine creatures, there are tremendous difficulties in the study on ocean. The underwater camera deployed on these platforms has increased the capacity to study marine creatures. Many redundant data in these videos from the underwater camera result in excessive waste of storage resources and difficulties in valid information retrieval. This paper proposed a seafloor video processing method combining computer algorithm and public participation. This method consists of valid video clips extraction and an analysis of the species of marine creatures. Four videos were selected to verify this method, the results showed that the valid frames clips of four videos were extracted properly with the accuracies of higher than 80%, and all creatures in video were identified.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Automatic facial micro-expression (ME) analysis is a growing field of research that has gained much attention in the last five years. With many recent works testing on limited data, there is a need to spur better approaches that are both robust and effective. This paper summarises the 2nd Facial Micro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC 2019) held in conjunction with the 14th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2019. In this workshop, we proposed challenges for two micro-expression (ME) tasks-spotting and recognition, with the aim of encouraging rigorous evaluation and development of new robust techniques that can accommodate data captured across a variety of settings. In this paper, we outline the evaluation protocols for the two challenge tasks, the datasets involved, and an analysis of the best performing works from the participating teams, together with a summary of results. Finally, we highlight some possible future directions. &amp;copy; 2019 IEEE.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms used by millions of users daily to post their opinions and emotions. Consequently, Twitter tweets have become a valuable knowledge source for emotion analysis. In this paper, we present a new framework, K2, for tweet emotion mapping and emotion change analysis. It introduces a novel, generic spatio-temporal data analysis and storytelling framework that can be used to understand the emotional evolution of a specific section of population. The input for our framework is the location and time of where and when the tweets were posted and an emotion assessment score in the range [Formula: see text], with [Formula: see text] representing a very high positive emotion and [Formula: see text] representing a very high negative emotion. Our framework first segments the input dataset into a number of batches with each batch representing a specific time interval. This time interval can be a week, a month or a day. By generalizing existing kernel density estimation techniques in the next step, we transform each batch into a continuous function that takes positive and negative values. We have used contouring algorithms to find the contiguous regions with highly positive and highly negative emotions belonging to each member of the batch. Finally, we apply a generic, change analysis framework that monitors how positive and negative emotion regions evolve over time. In particular, using this framework, unary and binary change predicate are defined and matched against the identified spatial clusters, and change relationships will then be recorded, for those spatial clusters for which a match occurs. We also propose animation techniques to facilitate spatio-temporal data storytelling based on the obtained spatio-temporal data analysis results. We demo our approach using tweets collected in the state of New York in the month of June 2014.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Public datasets are valuable for the development of the learning-based algorithms. In the field of autonomous driving, almost all the existing public datasets are collected by manually driving cars, and most of them are contributed by American and European researchers and represent the traffic scenarios typical for these countries. To diversify the public driving datasets and to provide data support for researches on the self-driving vehicles moving on bike lanes, such as wheelchairs, bikes, and some robots, we present the Chinese Driving from a Bike View (CDBV), which is a driving dataset collected by a bike in Beijing, China. The CDBV dataset contains annotated images, raw videos, and code tools. The annotations are for the object detection tasks and especially focus on the categories with Chinese characteristics, including the express tricycles, the motorbikes specializing in takeouts, the bicycle landmarks, the zebra crossings, and the traffic lights. We totally annotated 40 064 traffic elements in 13 427 images. The CDBV dataset is publicly available at http://sujingwang.name/CDBV.html.&lt;/p&gt;",

Our current research uses Twitter tweets as the knowledge source for emotion analysis. The inputs for the emotion mapping and change analysis system, we are currently developing, are the location and time of the tweets and their corresponding emotion assessment score falling in the range [-1, +1], with +1 representing a very positive emotion and -1 representing a very negative emotion. We start by identifying spatial clusters that capture positive and negative emotion regions for batches of the dataset with each batch corresponding to a specific time interval, e.g. a single day. These obtained spatial clusters and their statistical summaries are then used as the input for Aconcagua which monitors change of emotions with respect to a set of unary and binary change predicates that are evaluated with respect to the set of spatial clusters; as the result of this process an emotion change graph is obtained whose nodes are spatial clusters and whose edges capture different types of temporal relationships between spatial clusters. An implementation of the change monitoring process is discussed which operates on top of a relational database and uses SQL queries to specify change predicates. To obtain more aggregated change summaries and ultimately change stories, the change graph further must be mined and summarized based on what aspects of change the analyst is interested in. To support such capabilities, our approach supports several types of change analysis templates called story types. We demo our approach using tweets collected in the state of New York in June 2014.",

      "abstract": "Public transportation systems, in particular, bus systems, play an essential role in the process of urbanization. Typically more bus stops enable more people to access the bus whereas lower the efficiency of bus system. This study uses a Spatial Interaction Coverage (SIC) model to identify and remove redundant bus stops while maintain the overall success of the whole bus system. The SIC model aims to model the relationship between demand points and bus stops. It takes factors such as the distance and the attractiveness of each bus stop into consideration. The simulated annealing algorithm is then applied with the SIC model to find the optimal combination of bus stops. By applying the SIC model to the iXpress 202 route in Kitchener-Waterloo region, it can effectively identify the number of stops to maintain and remove redundant stops. The bus operation efficiency can be increased by 7.28% after optimization. The SIC model provides a reliable method of modelling the interaction between facilities and demands. The ability of considering the attractiveness of stops and including distance decay into the model can help the transportation agency better plan bus routes. The relationships between bus ridership and the socioeconomic variables (population, income, and age) in the study area are also analyzed.",

      "abstract": "Twitter is one of the most popular social media platform where users post their views and emotions on a regular basis. Consequently, Twitter tweets have become a valuable knowledge source for emotion analysis. In this paper, we present a new framework for tweet emotion mapping and emotion change analysis. It introduces a novel, generic spatio-temporal data analysis and storytelling framework and its architecture. The input for our approach are the location and time were and when the tweets were posted and an emotion assessment score in [-1, +1], with +1 denoting a very positive emotion and -1 a very negative emotion. Our first step is to segment the input dataset into batches with each batch containing tweets that occur in a specific time interval, for example weekly, monthly or daily. Next, by generalizing existing kernel density estimation techniques, we transform each batch into a continuous function that takes positive and negative values. Next, we use contouring algorithms to find contiguous regions with highly positive and highly negative emotions for each of the batch. After that, we apply a generic, change analysis framework that monitors how positive and negative emotion regions evolve over time. In particularly, using this framework unary and binary change predicate are defined and matched against the identified spatial clusters, and change relationships will then be recorded, for those spatial clusters for which a match occurred. Finally, we propose animation techniques to facilitate spatio-temporal data storytelling based on the obtained spatio-temporal data analysis results. We demo our approach using tweets collected in the state of New York in June 2014.",

      "abstract": "Chemical hazardous material (Hazmat) transportation has become a very important safety issue to human society and the environment. Great attention has been drawn to reduce potential risks and incidents. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for the dynamic routing optimization of the chemical Hazmat transportation, which includes four major stages: (i) information collection and preparation; (ii) modeling and solving individual and system routing models; (iii) reactive routing optimization under uncertainties; and (iv) trade-off study for potential shipping delays. A novel MILP model has been developed to determine the optimal shipping path with the minimal transportation risk. This model consists of two parts: the individual and system routing models, which are designed to explore the optimal shipping path for each shipping pair and all transportation tasks, respectively. When uncertainties occur, reactive routing optimization will be performed for handling the leftover transportation tasks. In particular, if some preset shipping time limits are violated due to severe uncertainties, optimal solutions subject to different allowable shipping time (AST) will be iteratively identified, so that the relation between AST and the corresponding transportation risk can be figured out. The efficacy of the developed model has been demonstrated by three case studies. Through the developed model, a reduction of 46% and 34% on system transportation risks of studied transportation tasks can be accomplished when dealing with uncertainties. The obtained relation can be used to trade off AST and the transportation risk, so that stakeholders can be advised on their decision-making for shipping path selection.",

      "abstract": "Objective To analyze the status and influencing factors of job satisfaction of nurses at public hospitals, providing references for the teambuilding strategy of nurses. Methods Questionnaire survey method was used, in October 2017, to study job satisfaction of 1, 047 nurses at 13 public general hospitals, for a countermeasure study. Results Job satisfaction of the nurses was found at a medium level. Specifically, their overall job satisfaction score was 3.68, and the satisfaction scores of the following dimensions from high to low were: on-the-job training (3.91), hierarchical nurse use (3.79), performance appraisal (3.68), promotion evaluation (3.67), and remuneration (3.62) respectively. Contents of the five dimensions are strongly related to the overall job satisfaction (r>0.6). Job satisfaction scores of nurses with their differences in positions, annual income, and hospital level were significantly different (P< 0.05). The three main influencing factors for talent turnover rate are remuneration, workplace pressure and work environment.

      "abstract": "This paper summarises the Facial Micro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC 2018) held in conjunction with the 13th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) 2018. In this workshop, we aim to stimulate new ideas and techniques for facial micro-expression analysis by proposing a new cross-database challenge. Two state-of-the-art datasets, CASME II and SAMM, are used to validate the performance of existing and new algorithms. Also, the challenge advocates the recognition of micro-expressions based on AU-centric objective classes rather than emotional classes. We present a summary and analysis of the baseline results using LBP-TOP, HOOF and 3DHOG, together with results from the challenge submissions. © 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Recently, micro-expression recognition has obtained more and more attention due to its spontaneity. Moreover, how to extract feature from these subtle image sequences is still a hard issue. Currently, a lot of local patterns have been applied to describe these micro-changes, but in essence they are seldom specialized to capture fine structure changes in video clips and often need tens of frames to generate a descriptor through interpolation between frames. To make up for these deficiencies, this paper proposes a novel local pattern i.e. Local Two-Order Gradient Pattern (LTOGP) to describe the subtle changes in micro-expression sequences. Using this pattern, we can not only capture subtle changes in videos, but also only make use of 5 frames to generate a descriptor of a micro-expression clip rather than tens or hundreds of frames in related literatures. Experiments are conducted on two databases of CASME and CASME2 and the results show that our proposed method gains promising performance for micro-expression recognition with proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Increasing student retention rates in higher education is an important goal because of its pertinence to the institution's core mission and its financial well-being. However, the consistent low graduation rates during the past half-century demonstrate the persistence of this challenge. Online programs in higher educations are generally afflicted with even lower retention rates than on-campus programs. With increasing availability of institutional data in the past decade, we can apply data mining approaches to analyze those data to help with the retention problems. In the context of retaining more students in online programs, we develop an educational data mining framework to analyze the institutional data and predict the potential students who might leave online programs before the new term begins. Our goal of this project is to provide our administrators, instructors, and staff members an opportunity to take actions to intervene in the students' dropout process before it takes place to improve the online program retention rate. The performance evaluations of the proposed predictive models are discussed. Performance comparison with other methods in the literature is conducted as well. The outcome of this project has been adopted by our institution to increase the retention rate for distance education.",

      "abstract": "Clustering is one of the most commonly used data mining techniques. Shared nearest neighbor clustering is an important density-based clustering technique that has been widely adopted in many application domains, such as environmental science and urban computing. As the size of data becomes extremely large nowadays, it is impossible for large-scale data to be processed on a single machine. Therefore, the scalability problem of traditional clustering algorithms running on a single machine must be addressed. In this paper, we improve the traditional density-based clustering algorithm by utilizing powerful programming platform (Spark) and distributed computing clusters. In particular, we design and implement Spark-based shared nearest neighbor clustering algorithm called SparkSNN, a scalable density-based clustering algorithm on Spark for big data analysis. We conduct our experiments using real data, i.e., Maryland crime data, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm with respect to speed-up and scale-up. The experimental results well confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SparkSNN clustering algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Crude oil planning and scheduling is crucial to petroleum refineries because of the potential for significant economic benefits. In reality, however, crude oil scheduling activities are highly vulnerable to disruptions caused by various uncertainties. In this paper, a new proactive scheduling methodology simultaneously covering crude unloading, transferring, and processing (CUTP) has been developed. The CUTP scheduling methodology is to maximize the total profit subject to various inventory, operation, transportation, and production constraints, while maintaining the refinery normal operating conditions under the uncertainty of crude shipping delays. To quantify shipping delay uncertainties, a combined feasibility index has been developed and embedded into the developed continuous-time mixed-integer nonlinear programming scheduling model, which is solved by the global solver of ANTIGONE. In addition, the relationship between the total profit and the minimum flexibility threshold is also given. The efficacy of this study has been demonstrated by industrial-scale case studies.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Recently, there have been increasing interests in inferring mirco-expression from facial image sequences. Due to subtle facial movement of micro-expressions, feature extraction has become an important and critical issue for spontaneous facial micro-expression recognition. Recent works used spatiotemporal local binary pattern (STLBP) for micro-expression recognition and considered dynamic texture information to represent face images. However, they miss the shape attribute of face images. On the other hand, they extract the spatiotemporal features from the global face regions while ignore the discriminative information between two micro-expression classes. The above-mentioned problems seriously limit the application of STLBP to micro-expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a discriminative spatiotemporal local binary pattern based on an integral projection to resolve the problems of STLBP for micro-expression recognition. First, we revisit an integral projection for preserving the shape attribute of micro-expressions by using robust principal component analysis. Furthermore, a revisited integral projection is incorporated with local binary pattern across spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, we extract the novel spatiotemporal features incorporating shape attributes into spatiotemporal texture features. For increasing the discrimination of micro-expressions, we propose a new feature selection based on Laplacian method to extract the discriminative information for facial micro-expression recognition. Intensive experiments are conducted on three availably published micro-expression databases including CASME, CASME2 and SMIC databases. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves promising performance for micro-expression recognition.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Spatial-temporal clustering is very useful unsupervised learning technique and can be used to identify interesting distribution patterns from geo-located data. It is one of the most commonly used data mining techniques in many application domains, e.g. geographic information science, health science, and environmental science. In this paper, we propose a density-based spatial-temporal clustering algorithm for geo-located data points, based on an extension of the SNN (Shared Nearest Neighbor) clustering. The proposed algorithm allows the integration of location, time and other semantic attributes in the clustering process. This algorithm can find clusters of different sizes, shapes, and densities in noisy data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm through a case study involving a New York City taxi cab pickup data and Maryland crime data. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can discover interesting patterns and useful information from spatial-temporal data.",

      "abstract": "Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Clustering is a well-established density based clustering algorithm, which can find clusters of different sizes, shapes, and densities. SNN has been widely adopted in numerous applications. As the size of dataset becomes extremely large nowadays, it is inefficient or even impossible for large-scale data to be stored and processed on a single machine. Therefore, the scalability problem of clustering algorithm running on a single machine has to be addressed. In this paper, we improve the traditional SNN clustering algorithm by utilizing high-performance computing clusters and powerful programming platform (MapReduce) for big data analysis. In particular, we design the MapReduce-based Shared Nearest Neighbor clustering algorithm called MR-SNN for big data analysis.",

      "abstract": "Deception is a very common phenomenon and its detection can be beneficial to our daily lives. Compared with other deception cues, micro-expression has shown great potential as a promising cue for deception detection. The spotting and recognition of micro-expression from long videos may significantly aid both law enforcement officers and researchers. However, database that contains both micro-expression and macro-expression in long videos is still not publicly available. To facilitate development in this field, we present a new database, Chinese Academy of Sciences Macro-Expressions and Micro-Expressions (CAS(ME)(2)), which provides both macro-expressions and micro-expressions in two parts (A and B). Part A contains 87 long videos that contain spontaneous macro-expressions and micro-expressions. Part B includes 300 cropped spontaneous macro-expression samples and 57 micro-expression samples. The emotion labels are based on a combination of action units (AUs), self-reported emotion for every facial movement, and the emotion types of emotion-evoking videos. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) was employed for the spotting and recognition of macro-expressions and micro-expressions and the results were reported as a baseline evaluation. The CAS(ME)(2) database offers both long videos and cropped expression samples, which may aid researchers in developing efficient algorithms for the spotting and recognition of macro-expressions and micro-expressions.",

      "abstract": "The scheduling of an ethylene cracking furnace system should not only focus on the plant profitability but also address the concern of environmental sustainability. On the basis of the previous study (Zhao et al.1), this Article has developed a new scheduling model for the optimal operation of the cracking furnace system in ethylene plants by considering more practical operating features, such as nonhomogeneous last-batch ending times and furnace load makeups, as well as the background air-quality conscious decoking. With the newly developed model, the simultaneous furnace shutdown can be successfully avoided at the end of the scheduling time horizon; meanwhile, certain manufacturing capacity losses and upsets can be alleviated during furnace decoking operations. Furthermore, the obtained scheduling solution will be responsible for background air-quality concerns by wisely allocating furnace decoking emission peaks into time windows that would cause less adverse environmental impacts. The efficacy of the developed model has been demonstrated by a comprehensive case study.",

      "abstract": "Flaring emissions during abnormal operating conditions such as plant start-ups, shut-downs, and upsets in chemical process industries (CPI) are usually significant. Flare minimization can help to save raw material and energy for CPI plants, and to improve local environmental sustainability. In this paper, a systematic methodology based on plant-wide dynamic simulation is presented for CPI plant flare minimizations under abnormal operating conditions. Since off-specification emission sources are inevitable during abnormal operating conditions, to significantly reduce flaring emission in a CPI plant, they must be either recycled to the upstream process for online reuse, or stored somewhere temporarily for future reprocessing, when the CPI plant manufacturing returns to stable operation. Thus, the off-spec products could be reused instead of being flared. This can be achieved through the identification of viable design and operational strategies during normal and abnormal operations through plant-wide dynamic scheduling, simulation, and optimization. The proposed study includes three stages of simulation works: (i) developing and validating a steady-state model of a CPI plant; (ii) transiting the obtained steady-state plant model to the dynamic modeling environment; and refining and validating the plant dynamic model; and (iii) developing flare minimization strategies for abnormal operating conditions of a CPI plant via a validated plant-wide dynamic model. This cost-effective methodology has two main merits: (i) employing large-scale dynamic modeling and simulations for industrial flare minimization, which involves various unit models for modeling hundreds of CPI plant facilities; (ii) dealing with critical abnormal operating conditions of CPI plants such as plant start-up and shut-down. Two virtual case studies on flare minimizations for start-up operation (over 50% of emission savings) and shut-down operation (over 70% of emission savings) of an ethylene plant have been employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed study.",

      "abstract": "Ground-level ozone is a pervasive air pollutant, which could be formed from substantial flare emissions during chemical plant startup operations. Especially in regions where chemical plants are concentrated, the regional air quality (i.e., the ozone concentration) might be aggravated by simultaneous startup emissions from multiple chemical plants. Thus, it is environmentally important and cost-effective for optimal scheduling of multiplant startups under their manufacturing allowances to minimize possible adverse air-quality impacts. In this paper, a systematic methodology has been developed for air-quality conscious multiplant startups. Through case studies, they demonstrate that multiplant startups without any coordination could result in significant air-quality impacts (15.4 ppb increment). However, an optimal scheduling plan with several-hour tuning on the starting time of their startup operations would significantly reduce such adverse air-quality impacts (only 3.2 ppb increment). Another important finding is that the plant with the most emissions may not be the key player in the optimal scheduling to reduce adverse air-quality impacts. The study couples dynamic process simulation for industrial flare emissions with regional air-quality modeling and explores cost-effective and environmentally benign air-quality control strategies. It can provide valuable and quantitative support for all relevant stakeholders, including environmental agencies, regional plants, and local communities.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there are increasing interests in inferring mirco-expression from facial image sequences. Due to subtle facial movement of micro-expressions, feature extraction has become an important and critical issue for spontaneous facial micro-expression recognition. Recent works usually used spatiotemporal local binary pattern for micro-expression analysis. However, the commonly used spatiotemporal local binary pattern considers dynamic texture information to represent face images while misses the shape attribute of face images. On the other hand, their works extracted the spatiotemporal features from the global face regions, which ignore the discriminative information between two micro-expression classes. The above-mentioned problems seriously limit the application of spatiotemporal local binary pattern on micro-expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a discriminative spatiotemporal local binary pattern based on an improved integral projection to resolve the problems of spatiotemporal local binary pattern for micro-expression recognition. Firstly, we develop an improved integral projection for preserving the shape attribute of micro-expressions. Furthermore, an improved integral projection is incorporated with local binary pattern operators across spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, we extract the novel spatiotemporal features incorporating shape attributes into spatiotemporal texture features. For increasing the discrimination of micro-expressions, we propose a new feature selection based on Laplacian method to extract the discriminative information for facial micro-expression recognition. Intensive experiments are conducted on three availably published micro-expression databases. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves promising performance for micro-expression recognition.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there are increasing interests in inferring mirco-expression from facial image sequences. For micro-expression recognition, feature extraction is an important critical issue. In this paper, we proposes a novel framework based on a new spatiotemporal facial representation to analyze micro-expressions with subtle facial movement. Firstly, an integral projection method based on difference images is utilized for obtaining horizontal and vertical projection, which can preserve the shape attributes of facial images and increase the discrimination for micro-expressions. Furthermore, we employ the local binary pattern operators to extract the appearance and motion features on horizontal and vertical projections. Intensive experiments are conducted on three available published micro-expression databases for evaluating the performance of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the new spatiotemporal descriptor can achieve promising performance in micro-expression recognition.",

      "abstract": "A new reactive scheduling model in the form of FRS (full rescheduling strategy) for front-end crude oil operations has been developed. The reactive rescheduling model is triggered off across all the units at the time that tank malfunction is detected. As compared to the previous work (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.. 2014, 53, 12502–12518) more practical features have been addressed on tank failure handling solutions: (i) failure tank leftover inventory will be first evacuated to a backup tank, and later on directed to downstream units, and (ii) failure tank leftover inventory will be immediately directed to its downstream units. Furthermore, comprehensive strategy analyses have been conducted on partial rescheduling strategy (PRS) and FRS to validate their respective pros and cons. It is found out from case studies that although FRS results in more operational costs than PRS due to an increased number of time events, FRS is more flexible and less susceptible to current scheduling results, which ensures more robust solution identification as compared to the rigid solution space defined by PRS which sometimes leads to operational infeasibility.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are brief involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions and, thus, help detect lies. Because of their many promising applications, they have attracted the attention of researchers from various fields. Recent research reveals that two perceptual color spaces (CIELab and CIELuv) provide useful information for expression recognition. This paper is an extended version of our International Conference on Pattern Recognition paper, in which we propose a novel color space model, tensor independent color space (TICS), to help recognize micro-expressions. In this paper, we further show that CIELab and CIELuv are also helpful in recognizing micro-expressions, and we indicate why these three color spaces achieve better performance. A micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e., a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture and independent color components achieves a higher accuracy than does that of RGB. In addition, we define a set of regions of interests (ROIs) based on the facial action coding system and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. Experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performances for TICS, CIELab, and CIELuv are better than those for RGB or gray.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are brief facial movements characterized by short duration, involuntariness and low intensity. Recognition of spontaneous facial micro-expressions is a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Main Directional Mean Optical-flow (MDMO) feature for micro-expression recognition. We apply a robust optical flow method on micro-expression video clips and partition the facial area into regions of interest (ROIs) based partially on action units. The MDMO is a ROI-based, normalized statistic feature that considers both local statistic motion information and its spatial location. One of the significant characteristics of MDMO is that its feature dimension is small. The length of a MDMO feature vector is 36 x 2 = 72, where 36 is the number of ROIs. Furthermore, to reduce the influence of noise due to head movements, we propose an optical-flow-driven method to align all frames of a micro-expression video clip. Finally, a SVM classifier with the proposed MDMO feature is adopted for micro-expression recognition. Experimental results on three spontaneous micro-expression databases, namely SMIC, CASME and CASME II, show that the MDMO can achieve better performance than two state-of-the-art baseline features, i.e., LBP-TOP and HOOF.",

In this paper, a general methodology with multiobjective and deterministic optimization for AQMN design and redesign is developed. Generally, a Gaussian dispersion model is employed to create spatial pollution distributions according to historical meteorological conditions and updated emission source profiles. Then, a multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to optimally design an AQMN, which allows the relocation of existing monitoring stations and/or the addition of new monitoring stations. The optimization will maximize the detectable air-quality threshold violation frequency (AQTVF) for potential pollution events in the studied industrial zone as well as minimize the total budget cost for the AQMN implementation with considerations of existing monitoring station relocation, new station construction, and land use with different prices at different locations. The Pareto frontier of AQTVF versus total budget cost will also be provided for final decision making. The proposed methodology can be used to design a new AQMN or to retrofit an existing AQMN to monitor regional air quality more effectively. Multiple case studies are employed to demonstrate the method's efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Impellers of centrifugal compressors are generally loaded by fluctuating aerodynamic pressure in operations. Excessive vibration of the impellers can be induced by unsteady airflows and lead to severe fatigue failures. Traditional transient stress analyses implemented in time domain generally require multiple load-step, very time-consuming computations using input of temporal pneumatic force previously obtained from Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. For quick evaluation of structural integrity of impellers, it is necessary to develop random vibration models and solution approaches defined in frequency domain. In this paper, the Pseudo-Excitation Method (PEM) is used to obtain power spectral density of three-dimensional, dynamic displacement and stress of impellers. A finite element model of an unshrouded impeller of a centrifugal compressor is generated based on the result of unsteady CFD analysis. Compared with the direct transient stress analyses in time domain, the pseudo-excitation method provides accurate and fast estimation of dynamic response of the impeller, making it an applicable and efficient method for analyzing random vibration of impellers.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Micro-expression is a brief involuntary facial expression which reveals genuine emotions and helps detect lies. It intrigues psychologists and computer scientists&amp;#39; (especially on computer vision and pattern recognition) interests due to its promising applications in various fields. Recent research reveals that color may provide useful information for expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel color space model, Tensor Independent Color Space (TICS), for enhancing the performance of micro-expression recognition. An micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e. a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture in the independent color components can get higher accuracy than that in RGB. In addition, we define a set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. The experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performance in TICS is better than that in RGB or gray.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Mining multi-source enriched geo-spatial data is an important task in many application domains, such as environmental science, geographic information science, and social networks. In this paper, we propose a new density-based spatio-temporal clustering algorithm called Poly-ST-SNN and a post-processing analysis technique to extract interesting patterns and useful knowledge from multi-source enriched geo-spatial data. Poly-ST-SNN extends the well-established density-based Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) clustering algorithm. In contrast to previous works in this area, our approaches can cluster and analyze dynamically evolved complex enriched geo-spatial objects, i.e., polygons. We evaluate the effectiveness of our techniques through a challenging real case study involving ozone pollution events in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area. The experimental results show that our approaches can discover interesting spatio-temporal patterns and useful information from multi-source enriched ozone pollution data.",

      "abstract": "A robust automatic micro-expression recognition system would have broad applications in national safety, police interrogation, and clinical diagnosis. Developing such a system requires high quality databases with sufficient training samples which are currently not available. We reviewed the previously developed micro-expression databases and built an improved one (CASME II), with higher temporal resolution (200 fps) and spatial resolution (about 280×340 pixels on facial area). We elicited participants' facial expressions in a well-controlled laboratory environment and proper illumination (such as removing light flickering). Among nearly 3000 facial movements, 247 micro-expressions were selected for the database with action units (AUs) and emotions labeled. For baseline evaluation, LBP-TOP and SVM were employed respectively for feature extraction and classifier with the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method. The best performance is 63.41% for 5-class classification.",

      "abstract": "As a general framework, Laplacian embedding, based on a pairwise similarity matrix, infers low dimensional representations from high dimensional data. However, it generally suffers from three issues: 1) algorithmic performance is sensitive to the size of neighbors; 2) the algorithm encounters the well known small sample size (SSS) problem; and 3) the algorithm de-emphasizes small distance pairs. To address these issues, here we propose exponential embedding using matrix exponential and provide a general framework for dimensionality reduction. In the framework, the matrix exponential can be roughly interpreted by the random walk over the feature similarity matrix, and thus is more robust. The positive definite property of matrix exponential deals with the SSS problem. The behavior of the decay function of exponential embedding is more significant in emphasizing small distance pairs. Under this framework, we apply matrix exponential to extend many popular Laplacian embedding algorithms, e.g., locality preserving projections, unsupervised discriminant projections, and marginal fisher analysis. Experiments conducted on the synthesized data, UCI, and the Georgia Tech face database show that the proposed new framework can well address the issues mentioned above.",

      "abstract": "Spatiotemporal clustering is a process of grouping a set of objects based on their spatial and temporal similarities. In this paper we propose two new spatiotemporal clustering algorithms, called Spatiotemporal Shared Nearest Neighbor clustering algorithm (ST-SNN), and Spatiotemporal Separated Shared Nearest Neighbor clustering algorithm (ST-SEP-SNN), to cluster overlapping polygons that can change their locations, sizes and shapes over time. Both ST-SNN and ST-SEP-SNN are based on well established generic density-based clustering algorithm Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN), which can find clusters of different sizes, shapes, and densities in high dimensional data. New similarity functions are proposed for computing spatiotemporal similarities between spatiotemporal polygons as well. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in a case study involving ozone pollution events in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area. The experimental results show that both ST-SNN and ST-SEP-SNN algorithms can find interesting spatiotemporal patterns from ozone pollution data.",

      "abstract": "Tensor subspace transformation, a commonly used subspace transformation technique, has gained more and more popularity over the past few years because many objects in the real world can be naturally represented as multidimensional arrays, i.e. tensors. For example, a RGB facial image can be represented as a three-dimensional array (or 3rd-order tensor). The first two dimensionalities (or modes) represent the facial spatial information and the third dimensionality (or mode) represents the color space information. Each mode of the tensor may express a different semantic meaning. Thus different transformation strategies should be applied to different modes of the tensor according to their semantic meanings to obtain the best performance. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing tensor subspace transformation algorithm which implements different transformation strategies on different modes of a tensor accordingly. In this paper, we propose a fusion tensor subspace transformation framework, a novel idea where different transformation strategies are implemented on separate modes of a tensor. Under the framework, we propose the Fusion Tensor Color Space (FTCS) model for face recognition.",

      "abstract": "Chemical facilities, where large amounts of chemicals and fuels are processed, manufactured, and housed, are at high risk to originate air emission events, including intensive flaring and toxic gas release caused by various uncertainties such as equipment failure, false operation, natural disaster, or terrorist attack. Based on an available air-quality-monitoring network, to detect the possible emission sources (chemical plants) for an observed emission event, so as to support diagnostic and prognostic decisions in a timely and effective manner, a systematic method for abnormal emission identifications should be employed. In this article, a systematic methodology for such applications has been developed. It includes two stages of modeling and optimization work: (1) the determination of background normal emission rates from multiple emission sources and (2) multiobjective optimization for emission-source identification and quantification. This method not only can determine emission source location, starting time, and time duration responsible for an observed emission event, but can also estimate in reverse the dynamic emission rate and total emission amount from an accidental emission source. It provides valuable information for investigations of accidents and root-cause analysis for emission events; meanwhile, it helps evaluate the regional air-quality impact caused by such emission events as well. Case studies including the detection of a real SO2 emission event are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed methodology.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are facial expressions which are fleeting and reveal genuine emotions that people try to conceal. These are important clues for detecting lies and dangerous behaviors and therefore have potential applications in various fields such as the clinical field and national security. However, recognition through the naked eye is very difficult. Therefore, researchers in the field of computer vision have tried to develop micro-expression detection and recognition algorithms but lack spontaneous micro-expression databases. In this study, we attempted to create a database of spontaneous micro-expressions which were elicited from neutralized faces. Based on previous psychological studies, we designed an effective procedure in lab situations to elicit spontaneous micro-expressions and analyzed the video data with care to offer valid and reliable codings. From 1500 elicited facial movements filmed under 60fps, 195 micro-expressions were selected. These samples were coded so that the first, peak and last frames were tagged. Action units (AUs) were marked to give an objective and accurate description of the facial movements. Emotions were labeled based on psychological studies and participants' self-report to enhance the validity.",

      "abstract": "Due to the fact that many objects in the real world can be naturally represented as tensors, tensor subspace analysis has become a hot research area in pattern recognition and computer vision. However, existing tensor subspace analysis methods cannot provide an intuitionistic nor semantic interpretation for the projection matrices. In this paper, we propose Sparse Tensor Principal Component Analysis (STPCA), which transforms the eigen-decomposition problem to a series of regression problems. Since its projection matrices are sparse, STPCA can also address the occlusion problem. Experiment on Georgia tech database and AR database showed that the proposed method outperforms the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) in terms of accuracy and robustness.",

      "abstract": "As one of the fundamental features, color provides useful information and plays an important role for face recognition. Generally, the choice of a color space is different for different visual tasks. How can a color space be sought for the specific face recognition problem? To address this problem, we propose a sparse tensor discriminant color space (STDCS) model that represents a color image as a third-order tensor in this paper. The model cannot only keep the underlying spatial structure of color images but also enhance robustness and give intuitionistic or semantic interpretation. STDCS transforms the eigenvalue problem to a series of regression problems. Then one spare color space transformation matrix and two sparse discriminant projection matrices are obtained by applying lasso or elastic net on the regression problems. The experiments on three color face databases, AR, Georgia Tech, and Labeled Faces in the Wild face databases, show that both the performance and the robustness of the proposed method outperform those of the state-of-the-art TDCS model.",

      "abstract": "Abstract—Human action can be naturally represented as multidimensional arrays known as tensors. In this paper, a simple and efficient algorithm based on tensor subspace learning is proposed for human action recognition. An action is represented as a 3th-order tensor first, then tensor principal component analysis is used to reduce dimensionality and extract the most useful features for action recognition. So the spatial and temporal correlations of the action are preserved. After then, a nearest neighbor classifier based on tensor distance is used to recognize action, in other words, measuring the similarity between actions using tensor distance in tensor subspace. The proposed method is assessed by using a public video database, namely Weizmann human action data sets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method performs very well on that data sets, and robustness test has been carried out to testify the effectiveness.

LPP is a widely used manifold reduced dimensionality technique. But it suffers two problem: (1) Small Sample Size problem; (2)the performance is sensitive to the neighborhood size k. In order to address the problems, this paper proposed a Matrix Exponential LPP. To void the singular matrix, the proposed algorithm introduced the matrix exponential to obtain more valuable information for LPP. The experiments were conducted on two face database, Yale and Georgia Tech. And the results proved the performances of the proposed algorithm was better than that of LPP.",

      "abstract": "Recent research efforts reveal that color may provide useful information for face recognition. For different visual tasks, the choice of a color space is generally different. How can a color space be sought for the specific face recognition problem? To address this problem, this paper represents a color image as a third-order tensor and presents the tensor discriminant color space (TDCS) model. The model can keep the underlying spatial structure of color images. With the definition of n-mode between-class scatter matrices and within-class scatter matrices, TDCS constructs an iterative procedure to obtain one color space transformation matrix and two discriminant projection matrices by maximizing the ratio of these two scatter matrices. The experiments are conducted on two color face databases, AR and Georgia Tech face databases, and the results show that both the performance and the efficiency of the proposed method are better than those of the state-of-the-art color image discriminant model, which involve one color space transformation matrix and one discriminant projection matrix, specifically in a complicated face database with various pose variations.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a pest control model with natural enemy releases. The mathematical problem involves a predator-prey system with periodic coefficients and pulse conditions. First, we show that the system has a unique pest-free periodic solution, which is globally asymptotically stable under certain condition. Furthermore, we prove that the system is permanent if the pest-free periodic solution is unstable. The results generalize some conclusions in [8,9] for the system with constant coefficients. Some computer simulations are made to demonstrate the main results.",

      "abstract": "Polygons can serve an important role in the analysis of geo-referenced data as they provide a natural representation for particular types of spatial objects and in that they can be used as models for spatial clusters. This paper claims that polygon analysis is particularly useful for mining related, spatial datasets. A novel methodology for clustering polygons that have been extracted from different spatial datasets is proposed which consists of a meta clustering module that clusters polygons and a summary generation module that creates a final clustering from a polygonal meta clustering based on user preferences. Moreover, a density-based polygon clustering algorithm is introduced. Our methodology is evaluated in a real-world case study involving ozone pollution in Texas; it was able to reveal interesting relationships between different ozone hotspots and interesting associations between ozone hotspots and other meteorological variables.",

      "abstract": "Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have an increasingly appreciated role in cardiac injury and protection. To investigate novel tasks for members of the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in cardiac phenotype, we examined the behavior of the Tec isoform in myocardial ischemic injury. Ischemia-reperfusion, but not cardiac protective agents, induced altered intracellular localization of Tec, highlighting distinct actions of this protein compared with other isoforms, such as Bmx, in the same model. Tec is abundantly expressed in cardiac myocytes and assumes a diffuse intracellular localization under basal conditions but is recruited to striated structures upon various stimuli, including ATP. To characterize Tec signaling targets in vivo, we performed an exhaustive proteomic analysis of Tec-binding partners. These experiments expand the role of the Tec family in the heart, identifying the Tec isoform as an ischemic injury-induced isoform, and map the subproteome of its interactors in isolated cells.",

A series of silhouettes are transformed to a Serials-Frame image, from which the multi-scale features are extracted to construct the eigenSpace of a tensor, which named Serials-Frame Tensor(SF-Tensor). The SF-Tensor subspace analysis is applied to separate the variable views and people information to recognize different actions. Experiment results obtained show that the proposed method attains a good recognition rate and improves the efficiency significantly.",

The existing methods on sign language recognition are limited to certain view. In this paper, we use tensor subspace analysis to model a multi-view hand gesture to recognize 26 manual alphabetical letters. In our experiment, each hand gesture is captured from 5 different views. Two experiments are conducted on gray-scale images and binary images, respectively. The results show the proposed method has a good performance on multi-view.",

To determine whether Bmx participates in cardiac growth, we subjected mice deficient in the molecule (Bmx knockout mice) to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). In comparison with wild-type mice, which progressively developed massive hypertrophy following TAC, Bmx knockout mice were resistant to TAC-induced cardiac growth at the organ and cell level. Loss of Bmx preserved cardiac ejection fraction and decreased mortality following TAC. These findings are the first to demonstrate a necessary role for the Tec family of tyrosine kinases in the heart and reveal a novel regulator (Bmx) of pressure overload–induced hypertrophic growth.",

      "abstract": "Association rule discovery is one of kernel tasks of data mining. Concept lattice, induced from a binary relation between objects and features, is a very useful formal analysis tool. It represents the unification of concept intension and extension. It reflects the association between objects and features, and the relationship of generalization and specialization among concepts. There is a one-to-one correspondence between concept intensions and closed frequent itemsets. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for mining association rules based concept lattice called Area (Association Rule based Concept lAttice). Area algorithm uses concept-matrix to build a part of concept lattice, in which the intension of every concept be put into one-to-one correspondence with a closed frequent itemset. Then all association rules are discovered by 4 operators which are defined in this paper performed on these concepts.",

It is useful to study algorithms of building concept lattice in practical applications. There are several of algorithms of building concept lattice which have been developed. This paper presents an efficient algorithm named CMCG (concept- matrix based concepts generation) for building concept lattice and corresponding Hasse graph based on concept- matrix which is a novel notion. The Algorithm CMCG finds all lower neighbors of concept by using the rank of attribute in concept-matrix and generate corresponding Hasse graph. The validity of the algorithm was proved in theory and by experiment. The pseudo codes of CMCG Algorithm are given and that performance of CMCG is superior to one of Lattice Algorithm is proved at end.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia, a reduction in arterial blood flow to the heart muscle, often results in cell death and is critically mediated by both the angiogenic capacity of the myocardium and the ability of the target tissue itself to resist injury. Recent evidence has suggested a novel role for the non‐receptor tyrosine kinase Bmx in growth factor dependent angiogenesis and response to ischemia. However, the role of this protein in myocardial injury is unknown. In the present study, we used CD31 and lectin staining of endothelial cells in the adult mouse to reveal capillary density in the normal and ischemic heart. To evaluate the role of Bmx in the myocardium, immunoblotting of whole heart lysates as well as of isolated myocytes was used to detect protein expression in the adult animal. Likewise, confocal imaging was used to detect the presence of Bmx within the anatomical context of the heart and to localize it with specific associating proteins. In the isolated myocyte setting, the effects of hypoxia/reoxygenation on mRNA expression, total protein expression and phosphorylation of Bmx and its associated family members was examined along with an evaluation of the involvement of potential regulatory proteins. Coupled with studies of cell viability, these data provide the first glimpse at the role of Bmx signaling in the normal and ischemic myocardium. These studies were supported by AHA and NIH/NHLBI grant funding.",

      "abstract": "Focal adhesions are anatomical structures in cardiac cells at the juxtaposition of the extracellular matrix and the sarcolemma and are involved in mechanotransduction, or the transmission of mechanical forces to enact intracellular responses. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is thought to mediate signaling between the membrane and intracellular organelles (e.g. nucleus), however, the proteins involved in FAK signaling at different subcellular locations remain unknown. Therefore, we examined specific subsets of FAK interacting proteins by optimized immunoprecipitation (IP). To identify robust interactions, we examined those that were retained when the IP procedure was conducted in 2% Triton X-100, followed by SDS-PAGE separation and identification by LC/MS/MS. This stringency of wash conditions retained interactions of FAK primarily with structural proteins including integrins, actin, myosin, vimentin and SERCA. We are repeating these analyses following isolation with less detergent (0.5% NP-40) to identify proteins more transiently interacting with FAK and therefore potentially involved in intracellular signaling. We are also using proteomics and confocal microscopy to evaluate the proteins involved in FAK signaling specifically at the nucleus. Together these studies will provide important insights into the signaling microenvironment of FAK in cardiac cells. Supported by AHA and NIH/NHLBI.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects joints. During the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, the synovial lining becomes dramatically thickened and hyperplastic. This highly aggressive tissue invades and destroys articular cartilage and bone. Several lines of evidence suggest that the proliferation of the synovial tissue may be due to disruption in the control of the cell cycle or apoptotic pathways. In particular, mutations in the tumor suppressor protein p53 have been found in synovial tissue from RA joints. We have examined the effects of overexpression of p53 by adenoviral infection in synovial cells in culture and in synovial tissue in vivo in a rabbit model of arthritis. Here we demonstrate that p53 overexpression resulted in significant apoptosis in human and rabbit synovial cells in culture. Furthermore, intraarticular injection of Ad-p53 resulted in extensive and rapid induction of synovial apoptosis in the rabbit knee without affecting cartilage metabolism. Interestingly, a significant reduction in the leukocytic infiltrate was observed within 24 h postinfection of Ad.p53. These results suggest that intraarticular gene transfer of p53 is able to induce synovial apoptosis as well as reduce inflammation and thus may be useful clinically for the treatment of RA.",
