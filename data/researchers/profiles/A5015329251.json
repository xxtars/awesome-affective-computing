    "trend_summary": "Xiaolan Fu’s research centers on the computational and neuroscientific foundations of human emotion, with a strong emphasis on nonverbal affect—especially micro-expressions—as objective, quantifiable signals bridging psychology, AI, and clinical applications. Her work integrates multimodal measurement (EMG, ERP, MEG, fNIRS), deep learning for sparse behavioral cues, and cross-cultural validation, increasingly converging toward human-centered affective AI: systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to covert or contextually modulated emotion (e.g., masked faces, moral surprise, pandemic-related agency loss). A unifying thread is translational rigor—building databases (CASME series, CFBD, MFED), benchmarking affective models (e.g., EmotionHallucer), and grounding AI in psychological theory (e.g., agency, moral conscience, time perception under threat).",

      "abstract": "Background: Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are at heightened risk of delayed or missed vaccinations because of clinical complexity and provider uncertainty. Although China has issued expert consensus guidelines and established immunization advisory services, little is known about vaccination decision-making within routine district-level immunization services. This study examined vaccination recommendation patterns and factors associated with deferral or non-recommendation among CSHCN in these settings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between 1 April 2023, and 31 March 2024, in Changshou District, Chongqing, China, encompassing 18 primary health centers, five general hospitals and one special hospital. Children aged 0–18 years identified by physicians as having conditions potentially affecting vaccination decisions and with at least one documented vaccination-related consultation were included. Clinical characteristics and physician recommendations (“recommended,” “temporarily deferred,” “not recommended”) were recorded via the national Epidemiological Dynamic Data Collection (EDDC) system; subsequent vaccination uptake was verified using the Chongqing Immunization Information Management System. Logistic regression identified factors associated with deferral or non-recommendation. Results: A total of 761 participants were included in the analysis, with a median age of 12 months (IQR: 1–47). Among all vaccine-specific recommendations, 55.2% were classified as “recommended,” 43.4% as “temporarily deferred,” and 1.5% as “not recommended”. Deferral proportions varied markedly, highest in respiratory (73.6%) and immunologic (42.1%) conditions and lowest in neonatal disorders (4.0%). Compared with 0–6-month-olds, children aged 7–12 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.26, 95% CI 2.30–12.33) and &gt;13 months (aOR = 13.48, 95% CI 6.69–28.34) were more likely to receive deferral or non-recommendation; multimorbidity also increased odds (aOR = 20.68, 95% CI 11.26–40.10). Consultations at primary health centers were associated with a lower likelihood of deferral or non-recommendation (aOR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.15–0.45). Conclusion: Vaccination recommendations for CSHCN vary considerably across clinical profiles and facility types in routine immunization settings. Despite national initiatives, many vaccine doses remain deferred or not recommended. Disease-specific guidelines, enhanced provider training, and context-adapted decision-support tools are needed to promote timely and equitable immunization for this medically vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "Face perception research typically focuses on identity differences, primarily using White subjects. This approach often neglects how appearances can change across images and the diversity of other racial groups. We aim to develop a dataset to address these gaps and to assess the effectiveness of the dataset in facilitating the exploration of within-model variability under a range of conditions. The Chinese Face and Body Dataset (CFBD) offers a publicly accessible collection of 2,195 images from 117 Asian models. This dataset includes both standardized lab photos and personal photos taken in natural settings at various times. Each image was manually annotated for eight objective attributes: facial expressions, face views, body views, postures, photo types, environments, image quality, and accessories. Participants rated cropped face images from the CFBD for two social traits (attractiveness, trustworthiness) and one identity-relevant trait (distinctiveness). Attractiveness and distinctiveness showed higher within-model variability than between-model variability, as indicated by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (W = 5733, p = .022 for attractiveness; W = 7137, p < .001 for distinctiveness), whereas trustworthiness did not (W = 11700, p = .547). Personal photos received higher ratings than lab photos for attractiveness (t(88) = 9.676, p < .001), distinctiveness (t(88) = 9.618, p < .001), and trustworthiness (t(88) = 6.993, p < .001), underscoring the impact of type of photos on face perceptions. These findings suggest that perceived attractiveness and distinctiveness are more dependent on cues that vary across images, whereas trustworthiness is relatively dependent on cues that remain consistent. By enabling the exploration of within-model variability under diverse conditions, the CFBD significantly enhances face perception research, particularly for a previously underrepresented group in face perception.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, subtle facial expressions that reveal concealed emotions, offering key behavioral cues for social interaction. Characterized by short duration, low intensity, and spontaneity, MEs have been mostly studied through subjective coding, lacking objective, quantitative indicators. This paper explores ME characteristics using facial electromyography (EMG), analyzing data from 147 macro-expressions (MaEs) and 233 MEs collected from 35 participants. First, regarding external characteristics, we demonstrate that MEs are short in duration and low in intensity. Precisely, we proposed an EMG-based indicator, the percentage of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC%), to measure ME intensity. Moreover, we provided precise interval estimations of ME intensity and duration, with MVC% ranging from 7% to 9.2% and the duration ranging from 307 ms to 327 ms. This research facilitates fine-grained ME quantification. Second, regarding the internal characteristics, we confirm that MEs are less controllable and consciously recognized compared to MaEs, as shown by participants' responses and self-reports. This study provides a theoretical basis for research on ME mechanisms and real-life applications. Third, building on our previous work, we present CASMEMG, the first public ME database including EMG signals, providing a robust foundation for studying micro-expression mechanisms and movement dynamics through physiological signals.",

      "abstract": "Mind wandering attenuates widespread sensory and motor processing, both of which are mediated by phase coherence. However, it remains unclear i) whether mind wandering impacts both sensory input and motor output processing by modulating ii) neural entrainment to external stimuli, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC), and specifically iii) whether task difficulty with different degrees of attentional demands moderates the impact of mind wandering on phase coherence. Using the thought-probe method, we assessed participants’ attentional states during different sensory and motor tasks with varying task difficulty. We found that mind wandering decreased ITPC exclusively in less demanding tasks but not in difficult ones, regardless of whether the tasks involved visual input or motor output processing. Our results suggest that external task difficulty may modulate the balance between external and internal cognitive processing (e.g., mind wandering), with simpler tasks facilitating internally oriented cognition and increasing mind wandering. This balance between internal mind wandering and external task difficulty is mediated, in part, by phase coherence, which serves as an underlying neural mechanism. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that phase coherence and its dynamics (ITPC) play a key role in mediating the reciprocal balance of internal and external cognition—this suggests their partly shared cognitive-executive resources as entailed by the recently proposed Baseline model of cognition.",

      "abstract": "Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations, generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation, we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct, these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected models.

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements critical for detecting lies, drawing growing interest in psychology and computer science. However, annotating ME can burden human coders with excessive time commitment and overwhelming information that compromises coding reliability and efficiency. Such difficulties in data annotation also led to the small sample size problem and hindered the development of ME analysis. Specifically, our psychological research highlights the complexities involved in human annotation of key frames. To facilitate the annotating process of ME, we proposed the Micro-Expression Key Frame Inference (ME-KFI) problem, aiming to identify MEs’ temporal locations from a single frame, reducing manual annotation effort. We propose a Micro-Expression Contrastive Identification Annotation (MECIA) method as a solution to ME-KFI, including three modules: a contrastive module, an identification module, and an annotation module, corresponding to the three steps of manual annotation. The network’s outputs infer the key frame of ME clips. MECIA demonstrates superior performance over random baselines on SAMM and CAS(ME)<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> databases and maintains comparable recognition accuracy with ground-truth clips.",

      "abstract": "A person’s body shape spontaneously elicits first impressions of personality traits (e.g., lazy, extraverted). Previous research on Americans identified a trait space structured by valence (positive vs. negative) and agency (active vs. passive) (Hu et al., 2018). Here, we explore the generalizability of this structure for Chinese participants. American (41 females, 39 males) and Chinese (40 females, 40 males) participants rated 140 three-dimensional bodies across 30 personality traits, categorized by the Big Five domains (Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Openness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism). For Americans, dimensionality reduction analyses of trait ratings replicated Hu et al. (2018)’s valence (explained variance: 60.73% for female bodies, 53.71% for male bodies) and agency (female: 8.23%, male: 8.82%) dimensions. The trait space for Chinese participants, however, exhibited dimensions of valence (female: 61.34%, male: 59.26%) and Extraversion (female: 10.32%, male: 9.01%). Multiple linear regression with cross validation showed that body shape parameters predicted the pattern of trait inferences, as well as specific traits for both cultures. Conscientiousness and Extraversion were best predicted for Americans; Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neuroticism were best predicted for Chinese. Cross-culture correlations on same bodies showed large-scale correlations (⍴ ranges: 0.24 to 0.81) that were higher for Conscientiousness and Openness than for Extraversion. Americans associated skinnier bodies with both Conscientiousness and Extraversion, whereas Chinese individuals associated skinnier bodies with Conscientiousness and sturdier body shapes with Extraversion. These findings underscore the cultural similarities in valence/Conscientiousness inferences and the cultural differences in agency and Extraversion inferences. Valence/Conscientiousness generalized across culture, suggesting its adaptive function for selecting healthy and successful partners. Conversely, agency and Extraversion varied culturally, showing social motivation in selecting higher agency and more extraverted partners for social exchange in Americans compared to Chinese individuals. This study pioneers the exploration of cultural influences on body trait impressions, contributing to the development of a theory with broader global applicability.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of facial expression recognition is to recognize the corresponding emotions. However, people tend to hide their emotions by displaying facial expressions that differ from those evoked by emotions. These inconsistent facial expressions are referred to as masked facial expressions (MFEs). The automatic recognition of hidden emotions within an MFE using image data is challenging. In this study, we find distinctive movement patterns in the facial action units (AUs) of MFE sequences through a detailed analysis. Considering our findings, we propose handcrafted features called dynamic AU intensity features (DAIFs) to represent AU movement. Furthermore, we develop a decoupled AU transformer (DAUT) model for recognition, where the decoupled convolution operators ensure that the temporal information in the DAIF is not damaged. To further improve the recognition performance, we design self-supervised clip prediction for pretraining of DAUT. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs exceptionally well across all tasks in the MFE dataset, particularly improving accuracy by nearly double on the most challenging 36-class task. This suggests that leveraging temporal information from facial AU movements is a reliable and effective technique for recognizing MFEs.",

      "abstract": "Sense of agency refers to the subjective perception of initiating and controlling one's actions and their consequences within both individual and social contexts. It encompasses not only self-agency, where individuals feel in control of their actions from a first-person perspective, but also other-agency, where individuals comprehend the control exerted by others over their actions through mentalizing. This study explores the characteristics of implicit self-agency and other-agency in social interaction contexts using an interval estimation paradigm. The results indicate that voluntary actions lead to a temporal binding effect in individual contexts. Moreover, the reported intervals generated by the self in individual contexts are shorter than those in human-human and human-robot interaction contexts, suggesting a reduction in self-agency within social interaction contexts. Conversely, temporal intervals in human-human interactions are reported to be shorter than those in individual and human-robot interactions, indicating that other-agency remains unaffected. These findings highlight the distinct effects of social interaction contexts on self-agency and other-agency, offering novel empirical insights into human interaction behavior.",

      "abstract": "It has been found that mind wandering can impair motor control. However, it remains unclear whether the impact of mind wandering on motor control is modulated by movement difficulty and its associated neural mechanisms. To address this issue, we manipulated movement difficulty using handedness and finger dexterity separately in two signal-response tasks with identical experiment designs, in which right-handed participants performed key-pressing and key-releasing movements with the specified fingers, and they had to intermittently report whether their attention was \"On task\" or \"Off task.\" Key-releasing with the right index finger (RI) had a faster reaction time and stronger contralateral delta-theta (1-7 Hz) functional connectivity than with the left index (LI) in Experiment 1, and mind wandering only reduced the contralateral delta-theta functional connectivity and midfrontal delta-theta activity for key-releasing with RI. Key-pressing with right index and middle fingers (RIR) had a faster reaction time and stronger midfrontal delta-theta activity than with right index and ring fingers (RIR) in Experiment 2, and mind wandering only reduced the midfrontal delta-theta activity for key-pressing with RIM. Theta oscillations are vital in motor control. These findings suggest that mind wandering only impairs the motor control of relatively simple movements without affecting the difficult ones. It supports the notion that mind wandering competes for executive resources with the primary task. Moreover, the quantity of executive resources recruited for a task and how these resources are allocated is contingent upon the task difficulty, which may determine whether mind wandering would interfere with motor control.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The accurate estimation of time‐to‐collision (TTC) is essential for the survival of organisms. Previous studies have revealed that the emotional properties of approaching stimuli can influence the estimation of TTC, indicating that approaching threatening stimuli are perceived to collide with the observers earlier than they actually do, and earlier than non‐threatening stimuli. However, not only are threatening stimuli more negative in valence, but they also have higher arousal compared to non‐threatening stimuli. Up to now, the effect of arousal on TTC estimation remains unclear. In addition, inconsistent findings may result from the different experimental settings employed in previous studies. To investigate whether the underestimation of TTC is attributed to threat or high arousal, three experiments with the same settings were conducted. In Experiment 1, the underestimation of TTC estimation of threatening stimuli was replicated when arousal was not controlled, in comparison to non‐threatening stimuli. In Experiments 2 and 3, the underestimation effect of threatening stimuli disappeared when compared to positive stimuli with similar arousal. These findings suggest that being threatening alone is not sufficient to explain the underestimation effect, and arousal also plays a significant role in the TTC estimation of approaching stimuli. Further studies are required to validate the effect of arousal on TTC estimation, as no difference was observed in Experiment 3 between the estimated TTC of high and low arousal stimuli.",

Our study explores how people instinctively turn to the fundamental principles of the physical world to overcome communication barriers. Specifically, through the Tacit Communication Game, we investigate how participants develop novel strategies for conveying messages without relying on common linguistic signals. We developed a new computational model built from the principle of expectancy violations of a set of common universal priors derived from movement kinetics. The model closely resembles the Sender’s messages, with its core variable – the information-theoretic surprise – explaining the Receiver’s physiological and neural responses. This is evidenced by a significant correlation with the pupil diameter, indicating cognitive effort, and neural activity in brain areas related to expectancy violations. This work highlights the adaptability of human communication, showing how surprise can be a powerful tool in forming new communicative strategies without relying on common language.",

      "abstract": "<p indent=\"0mm\">Currently, the \"eyeball economy\" is developing rapidly. Facial attractiveness plays an important role in social transactions and the labor market. Biases in favor of attractive faces have been documented in research on attention, memory and other cognitive processes. Many researchers have investigated the influence of facial attractiveness on economic decision-making in recent years. Previous studies have shown that people make different decisions about attractive partners than about unattractive partners. However, the effect of facial attractiveness has been inconsistent across different studies. A large number of studies have confirmed the beauty premium effect such that people show preferences for attractive faces, while other research has revealed the beauty penalty or ugliness premium effect. Three different explanations have been proposed for the effect of facial attractiveness on decision-making, including explanations by economists, explanations by social psychologists, and evolutionary explanations. Economists developed a taste-based discrimination model and a statistical discrimination model. The former assumes that people prefer attractive faces regardless of their personality traits or behavioral performance, while the latter suggests that good-looking people usually perform better at their work and have a greater ability to negotiate higher wages with their employers. Like what the statistical discrimination model proposes, social psychologists suggest that attractive individuals often have more positive traits, that is, the \"beauty is good\" stereotype. For example, good-looking individuals are perceived as friendlier, more generous, more trustworthy, more competent, etc. However, explanations by economists and social psychologists are descriptive and indirect. Both of these explanations ignore the impact of sex on the bias toward facial attractiveness. Evolutionary explanations propose a more direct and comprehensive perspective that the bias of facial attractiveness in economic decision-making occurs because of the genetic and mating value of attractiveness. A beautiful appearance is usually a sign of good genes, which represents high mate value. The theory also offers possible explanations for the different decisions made toward same-sex versus opposite-sex attractive individuals (i.e., intrasexual competition versus intersexual selection). Although the explanations from different disciplines reflect a difference between levels of analyses and mechanisms, they do not completely conflict with each other. These factors are compatible with each other in explaining the bias of facial attractiveness when predicting the phenomenon of beauty premiums without considering sex. However, the evolutionary explanation provides a more comprehensive hypothesis for the greater effect of opposite-sex facial attractiveness on decision-making than that of same-sex faces. Nonetheless, the influence of facial attractiveness on economic decision-making is complex and multifaceted; therefore, it can be fully understood only by considering and integrating multiple perspectives, which are difficult to explain through the use of a single theoretical system. Electrophysiological studies have further revealed the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the cognitive processing of facial attractiveness and the perception of fairness and risk during decision-making and revealed that attractive faces induce a greater late positive component and activate brain regions related to reward processing, such as the nucleus accumbens, orbital frontal cortex, and ventral striatum. Although cognitive neuroscience studies have demonstrated the neurobiological mechanisms by which facial attractiveness affects economic decision-making, they do not provide strong evidence for the above three theoretical explanations because psychological factors such as preferences, stereotypes, and mating motives were not measured. Future research should investigate the interaction of multimodal attractiveness information such as voice and smell information in real economic decision-making situations, integrate electrophysiological studies with the existing theoretical system to comprehensively understand the underlying neural mechanism, and establish a comprehensive and systematic theoretical model to provide a theoretical basis for controlling appearance bias in the labor market and other social transactions.",

      "abstract": "People sometimes intentionally change their facial expressions to mask their real emotions. Currently, there is relatively little research on the recognition of masked expressions. The effective identification of masked expressions helps to identify deception and lies and has important application value. Traditional machine learning methods require the manual design of feature extraction algorithms and have poor performance in facial expression recognition. This study performs masked expression recognition based on convolutional neural networks, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and MobileNet. Data augmentation and regularization are used to improve the performance of the network. The recognition rate of masked expressions has been significantly improved. Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, the recognition accuracy is 63.62% for required expressions (6R), 39.97% for experienced emotions evoked by video clips (6E), and 22.11% for 36 mixed expressions (6Ex6R), which is improved by 33.19%, 48.99%, and 96.52% compared to traditional methods, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Facial expression recognition is currently one of the research hotspots in the field of artificial intelligence. In addition to normal natural expressions, people sometimes intentionally change their facial expressions to mask their real emotions. Masked expressions are more complex than ordinary expressions, and the number of masked expression datasets that can be used for model training is limited. The automatic recognition of masked expressions will be a new challenge. Traditional machine learning requires the manual design of feature extraction algorithms, resulting in low expression recognition rates. Deep learning requires a large amount of labeled data and has poor model performance on small sample datasets. This paper proposes a method based on transfer learning, which transfers the pre-trained weights to the model, reconstructs the classifier to complete new tasks, and combines data augmentation and regularization to improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model. It has achieved good results on the Masked Facial Expression Database (MFED). Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, the recognition accuracy is 64.78% for required expressions (6R), 42.16% for experienced emotions evoked by video clips (6E), and 21.21% for 36 mixed expressions (6Ex6R), which is improved by 35.61%, 57.14%, and 88.52% compared to traditional methods, respectively. The experiment deepens the research on the recognition of masked expressions, providing a possible method for the recognition of deception and lies.",

One disadvantage of them is the using of OTA for standard substances and conjugates, which may trigger exposure risks to operators and environmental contamination without proper handling. In this study, the anti-OTA monoclonal antibody is used as the target molecule, and the mimotope of the OTA is screened from the phage random 7-peptide library. After three rounds of screening, 40 phage clones are selected and verified by the anti-OTA monoclonal antibody 2606, of which 36 can be inhibited by OTA in an ELISA test. DNA of those positive clones is extracted and sequenced, resulting in 18 different amino acid sequences.",

      "abstract": "Zearalenone is one of the most widely distributed mycotoxins in the world. It can lead to hormonal imbalances and various reproductive disorders. In ZEN's research and testing activities, the use of ZEN toxin standards and artificial antigens will affect the health and safety of experiment operators. Therefore, through the phage display technology, the mimetic peptide of ZEN was panned out, which can replace the zearalenone molecule for a series of research and testing activities. An anti-ZEN monoclonal antibody (5G5) was used as the target molecule, and the mimic epitopes of ZEN were screened from the phage random loop-constrained seven peptide library. The competition curve of the 11 positive phages was established by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nine mimotope peptides of the 11 positive phages share the common sequence, which is tryptophan(W)-tyrosine(Y)-arginine(R)-leucine(L). The competition curves of the 11 positive phages were established. The linear range was around 10-1000pg/mL. And the detection limit was about 10 pg/mL. The results suggest that these phage peptides could replace ZEN to establish immunoassays.",

Phage random peptide library technology provides a new means. In this study, an anti-AFB1 monoclonal antibody 2E10 was used as the target molecule to screen the mimotope of AFB1 by phage displaying technology, and from a phage random C7C peptide library. After four rounds of panning, a total of 37 phage clones were selected for verification, and 32 of them can bind specifically to the anti-AFB1 monoclonal antibody 2E10. In combination, an indirect competitive ELISA indicated that AFB1 could inhibit 23 positive phage clones for binding the antibody. DNA extraction and sequencing analysis showed six mimotope peptides.",

      "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA) refers to the feeling of being in control of one's actions and the subsequent consequence of these actions. Emotional context seems to alter the strength of sense of agency. The present study explored the influence of acute psychosocial stress on the SoA by means of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Self-assessment manikin (SAM) and objective physiological indicators (e.g. heart rate, electrodermal activity, and salivary cortisol levels) were utilized to evaluate the effect of the TSST. We also employed the temporal binding effect as an implicit assessment of the participant's SoA. The results indicated that the stress level of the experimental group after TSST was significantly higher than the control group, whilst the temporal binding scores of the experimental group decreased after TSST manipulation. In short, acute psychosocial stress with intense emotional arousal weakened the sense of agency.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It has been found that mind wandering interferes with the sensory and cognitive processing of widespread stimuli. However, it remains unclear what factors can modulate the magnitude of the interference effects of mind wandering. Here, we investigate whether and how word familiarity modulates the interference effects of mind wandering on semantic and reafferent information processing. High- and low-frequency words were used as stimuli to induce high- and low-familiarity contexts in a sustained attention to response task, in which participants were required to respond to Chinese nonanimal words (nontarget) and withhold responses to Chinese animal words (target) as well as to intermittently report whether their state was “on task” or “off task.” Behavioral results revealed lower reaction stability for both high- and low-frequency nontarget words preceding “off-task” reports than those preceding “on-task” reports. However, ERP results revealed that low-frequency rather than high-frequency words elicited more negative N400, attenuated late positive complex, and attenuated reafferent potential for “off-task” reports than for “on-task” reports. The results suggest that mind wandering makes semantic extraction and integration more difficult for unfamiliar but not familiar two-character Chinese words and attenuates the reafferent feedback of the motor response. These findings are consistent with the decoupling hypothesis of mind wandering and provide the first neural evidence for how familiarity with external stimuli modulates the interference effects of mind wandering.",

Literature on cross-cultural differences in cognition suggests that categorization, as an information processing and organization strategy, was more often used by Westerners than by East Asians, particularly for older adults. This study examines East-West cultural differences in memory for categorically processed items and sources in young and older Canadians and native Chinese with a conceptual source memory task (Experiment 1) and a reality monitoring task (Experiment 2). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;. In Experiment 1, participants encoded photographic faces of their own ethnicity that were artificially categorized into GOOD or EVIL characters and then completed a source memory task in which they identified faces as old-GOOD, old-EVIL, or new. In Experiment 2, participants viewed a series of words, each followed either by a corresponding image (i.e., SEEN) or by a blank square within which they imagined an image for the word (i.e., IMAGINED). At test, they decided whether the test words were old-SEEN, old-IMAGINED, or new. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;. In general, Canadians outperformed Chinese in memory for categorically processed information, an effect more pronounced for older than for young adults. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;. Extensive exercise of culturally preferred categorization strategy differentially benefits Canadians and reduces their age group differences in memory for categorically processed information. &lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "<p indent=\"0mm\">The risk-taking tendency in human decision-making is not entirely negative. It can be positive and pro-social when the purpose is beneficial to others or society. Recently, several scholars have investigated and compared the internal mechanisms of the generation and development of individual negative risk and positive prosocial behaviors using research methods from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience. They found overlapping neural circuits, thus, they proposed the concept of prosocial risky behavior. This term refers to the dual positive nature of individual risk-taking and prosocial tendencies in a given behavior. It provides a theoretical premise for the tendency of harmful human behavior to shift in a positive direction. Prosocial risky behavior is risk-taking for the benefit of others or for general social welfare. It is dangerous yet prosocial. Thus, it often alternates with risky negative behavior. Prosocial risky behavior is difficult to identify in everyday life. However, to some extent it shows the hallmarks of positive, healthy human development. For prosocial risky behavior, the current research is scattered, lacking systematic classification. Previous studies have interpreted only its mechanisms and neural basis regarding risk or social preference. Some previous studies have regarded prosocial risky behavior as simple prosocial behavior, focusing primarily on the influence of risk factors (risk preferences). Other researchers regarded prosocial risky behavior as simple risk-taking behavior, mainly focusing on prosocial motivation’s influence (social preferences). Less so, with this concern, but special social behavior. This study’s objective is to examine the concept of prosocial risky behavior, including its definition and measurement. It aims to achieve an integrated view of prosocial behavior and risk behavior, and clarify their connection from the perspective of risk and social preferences in the evolution of prosocial risky behavior. A novel theoretical model of prosocial risky behavior is constructed. Furthermore, the study provides a detailed explanation of the neural basis and temporal processing characteristics of prosocial risky behavior. Future research should clarify the psychological structure of prosocial risky behavior, optimize its paradigm, and compare framing effect features and their cognitive neural mechanisms, specifically with reference to economics and social decision-making. In addition, future research should explore the characteristics and developmental rules of prosocial risky behavior across the lifespan related to: Decision-makers, decision-making objects, and decision situations. This effort could deepen our understanding of its characteristics and mechanisms and reveal how the framing effect works in prosocial risky behavior. In addition, it should clarify its potential neural mechanisms providing a practical and reliable empirical basis for verifying a theoretical model of prosocial risky behavior. Simultaneously, it has important, instructive theoretical implications for the stimulation of prosocial risky behavior and the promotion of individual performance.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are facial expressions that individuals reveal when trying to hide their genuine emotions. It has potential applications in areas such as lie detection and national security. It is generally believed that micro-expressions have three essential characteristics: short duration, low intensity, and local asymmetry. Most previous studies have investigated micro-expressions based on the characteristic of short duration. To our knowledge, no empirical studies have been conducted on the low-intensity characteristic. In this paper, we use facial EMG for the first time to study the characteristic of low intensity for micro-expression. In our experiment, micro-expressions were elicited from subjects and simultaneously collected their facial EMG through the second-generation micro-expression elicitation paradigm. We collected and annotated 33 macro-expressions and 48 micro-expressions. By comparing the two indicators of EMG :(1) the percentage of apex value in maximum voluntary contraction (MVC%) and (2) the area under EMG signal curve (integrated EMG, iEMG), we found that the MVC% and iEMG of micro-expression were significantly smaller than that of macro-expression. The result demonstrates that the intensity of micro-expression is significantly smaller than that of macro-expression.",

      "abstract": "Since December 2019, the fast-spreading coronavirus disease has ravaged China, threatening people’s lives and health and affecting China’s economic and social development. The development of the epidemic and the effectiveness of prevention and control will not only directly affect the physical and mental health of individuals, but also affect the social and psychological behaviors such as government trust, interpersonal trust, risk communication, economic confidence, consumption behavior and social mentality. In the epidemic prevention and control, as well as national emergency management and social governance, it is urgent to improve and promote the construction of social psychological service system. It is suggested to improve the emergency management laws and regulations in time and incorporate the social psychological service guarantee system into the emergency management system; build a professional team of social psychological services for emergency management, and guide social forces to play their role in a standardized and orderly manner; give full play to the role of network and information technology to realize the accurate connection and refined management of psychosocial service needs and resources in emergency management; strengthen the research on emergency management psychology to provide knowledge accumulation and scientific support for improving the governance system, improving governance efficiency and improving governance ability.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The human temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a brain area crucial for processing social information. Although brain stimulation studies have started to explore the causal function of TPJ under social contexts, few have explicitly considered bilateral TPJ as target regions. Here, leveraging non-invasive continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) and hierarchical Bayesian computational modeling, we tested whether left or right TPJ (with vertex as control) is causally involved in how dissenting choices by others influence individuals’ choice adjustments in goal-directed learning. In our social learning paradigm, participants (N = 31) first made their private decision, and then were allowed to re-adjust their choices after observing choices of four other players. Behaviorally, we show that disruption of the left, but not the right TPJ, weakened participants’ choice adjustment and delayed their response speed when confronted with dissenting information from the other players. Computationally, disrupting activity in the left TPJ attenuated the degree of computing social influence during choice adjustment, whereas the extent to which how observational learning from others’ choices was integrated into direct learning remained intact. Together, our results provide evidence for the causal role of left TPJ in social influence during goal-directed learning and shed light on the relational function (with respect to oneself) of the TPJ in social cognition.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression (ME) is a significant non-verbal communication clue that reveals one person's genuine emotional state. The development of micro-expression analysis (MEA) has just gained attention in the last decade. However, the small sample size problem constrains the use of deep learning on MEA. Besides, ME samples distribute in six different databases, leading to database bias. Moreover, the ME database development is complicated. In this article, we introduce a large-scale spontaneous ME database: CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup>. The contribution of this article is summarized as follows: (1) CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> offers around 80 hours of videos with over 8,000,000 frames, including manually labeled 1,109 MEs and 3,490 macro-expressions. Such a large sample size allows effective MEA method validation while avoiding database bias. (2) Inspired by psychological experiments, CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> provides the depth information as an additional modality unprecedentedly, contributing to multi-modal MEA. (3) For the first time, CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> elicits ME with high ecological validity using the mock crime paradigm, along with physiological and voice signals, contributing to practical MEA. (4) Besides, CAS(ME) <sup>3</sup> provides 1,508 unlabeled videos with more than 4,000,000 frames, i.e., a data platform for unsupervised MEA methods. (5) Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of depth information by the proposed depth flow algorithm and RGB-D information.",

      "abstract": "Facial expression recognition plays a crucial role in understanding the emotion of people, as well as in social interaction. Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been repeatedly reported to be impaired in recognizing facial expressions. This study aimed to investigate the confusion effects between two facial expressions that presented different emotions and to compare the difference of confusion effect for each emotion pair between patients with MDD and healthy controls. Participants were asked to judge the emotion category of each facial expression in a two-alternative forced choice paradigm. Six basic emotions (i.e., happiness, fear, sadness, anger, surprise, and disgust) were examined in pairs, resulting in 15 emotion combinations. Results showed that patients with MDD were impaired in the recognition of all basic facial expressions except for the happy expression. Moreover, patients with MDD were more inclined to confuse a negative emotion (i.e., anger and disgust) with another emotion as compared to healthy controls. These findings highlight the importance that patients with MDD show a deficit of sensitivity in distinguishing specific two facial expressions.",

This article reviewed the research findings and theories on representation, generation, and adjustion of belief, and proposed a new three-dimensional network psychological model of belief representation. Belief is represented in two forms, belief sentence and belief structure diagram, and consists of four key elements, which are belief content, belief value, grammar, and link. Based on this belief representation, this article expounded how belief generates and changes, and a possible abstract model for simulation by artificial general intelligence.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background Maresin-1 is one of anti-inflammatory pro-resolving mediators, which is considered as a potential regulator of metabolic diseases. However, little information is available on the relationship between Maresin-1 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans. Therefore, this study explored the associations between serum Maresin-1 levels and NAFLD. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 240 Chinese people, including 116 non-NAFLD subjects and 124 NAFLD patients. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. Serum Maresin-1 levels were determined by ELISA. The association between Maresin-1 and NAFLD was assessed. Results Serum Maresin-1 levels in NAFLD patients were markedly lower than those in non-NAFLD subjects (63.63 [59.87–73.93] vs 73.11 [65.12–84.50] pg/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.000). The percentages of patients with NAFLD gradually decreased in tandem with increasing quartiles of Maresin-1 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, serum Maresin-1 levels were positively associated with AST/ALT, albumin, Albumin-globulin-ratio, and HDL-C (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and negatively associated with BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, ALT, GGT, uric acid, TG, and FBG (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) after adjusting for sex and age. We found that serum Maresin-1 levels were significantly associated with NAFLD by binary logistic regression analysis. Conclusions Circulating Maresin-1 levels were decreased in patients with NAFLD, and there was a negative correlation between NAFLD and serum Maresin-1 concentrations. Decreased Maresin-1 might be involved in the development of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Although many studies have provided evidence that abstract knowledge can be acquired in artificial grammar learning, it remains unclear how abstract knowledge can be attained in sequence learning. To address this issue, we proposed a dual simple recurrent network (DSRN) model that includes a surface SRN encoding and predicting the surface properties of stimuli and an abstract SRN encoding and predicting the abstract properties of stimuli. The results of Simulations 1 and 2 showed that the DSRN model can account for learning effects in the serial reaction time (SRT) task under different conditions, and the manipulation of the contribution weight of each SRN accounted for the contribution of conscious and unconscious processes in inclusion and exclusion tests in previous studies. The results of human performance in Simulation 3 provided further evidence that people can implicitly learn both chunking and abstract knowledge in sequence learning, and the results of Simulation 3 confirmed that the DSRN model can account for how people implicitly acquire the two types of knowledge in sequence learning. These findings extend the learning ability of the SRN model and help understand how different types of knowledge can be acquired implicitly in sequence learning.",

Different from the original feature difference (FD) analysis, in this paper, we proposed a novel temporal and spatial domain weight analysis of feature difference (TSW-FD) to achieve micro-expression spotting. The experimental results showed that TSW-FD improved 17.86% and 24.21% in F1-Score comparing to the FD in CASME II and SMIC-E-HS.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression spotting is a fundamental step in the micro-expression analysis. This paper proposes a novel network based convolutional neural network (CNN) for spotting multi-scale spontaneous micro-expression intervals in long videos. We named the network as Micro-Expression Spotting Network (MESNet). It is composed of three modules. The first module is a 2+1D Spatiotemporal Convolutional Network, which uses 2D convolution to extract spatial features and 1D convolution to extract temporal features. The second module is a Clip Proposal Network, which gives some proposed micro-expression clips. The last module is a Classification Regression Network, which classifies the proposed clips to micro-expression or not, and further regresses their temporal boundaries. We also propose a novel evaluation metric for spotting micro-expression. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the two long video datasets: CAS(ME)<sup>2</sup> and SAMM, and the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation is used to evaluate the spotting performance. Results show that the proposed MESNet effectively enhances the F1-score metric. And comparative results show the proposed MESNet has achieved a good performance, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially in the SAMM dataset.",

      "abstract": "Humans sometimes intentionally altered facial expression to mask the genuine emotions for certain purposes. Such masked facial expressions have seldom been recorded. In this study, we constructed a facial expression database in which participants were required to watch emotional video clips and make specific facial expressions which were consistent or inconsistent with the emotional context, and named it Masked Facial Expression Database (MFED). Twenty-four participants were recruited and trained to be familiar with six basic facial expressions. They were instructed to display six expressions under six basic emotional context which resulted in 36 combinations. Seven hundred and eighty three emotional video clips including 36 (6 by 6) categories of facial expressions were collected. We also utilized Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to encode these facial expressions. In addition, local binary patterns from three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) and support vector machine (SVM) were employed for feature extraction and subsequent leave-one-subject-out cross validation, respectively. Best performance of classification is 78.80% for masked and non-masked, 26.83% for experienced emotion evoked by video clips, and 47.77% for required (presented by instructions) expressions. For improving the performance of experienced emotion and required expression recognition, a well-designed convolutional neural network (CNN) was also utilized to capture high-level representations of facial expression images. Our clear-cut results demonstrated that masked and non-masked expressions could be moderately discriminated in this database. Experienced emotion was difficult to identify partly because it was definitely covered up by the masked expression.",

      "abstract": "Designing a tactile image for blind people is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of recognizing objects on a 2D line drawing image by touch compared to vision. In this paper, we proposed \"tactile accuracy\", a new criterion to evaluate the performance of recognizing 242 raised line images of common objects for 30 subjects (10 blindfolded sighted subjects, 10 congenitally blind subjects, and 10 late blind subjects), instead of the conventional \"naming accuracy\" used in the visual image recognition tasks. We used multi-level evaluation criteria including \"tactile accuracy\" to systematically analyze the design factors in tactile images. The results showed that using multi-level evaluate criteria could help unveil the tactile cognitive preferences of different types of subjects for personalized learning. Moreover, we reported important design factors that affect tactile image recognition, thus providing guidelines on the design of tactile images.",

      "abstract": "Moral hypocrisy (MH) occurs when people fail to practice what they preach. Despite the prevalence of the effect of social identity on an individual's MH, few empirical studies have explored contextual factors that may help reduce MH. By conducting two experiments based on the research paradigm of real stranger presence, we examined how in-group and out-group strangers' presence and moral behavior may contribute to reducing MH. The results of experiment 1 demonstrated that compared with the presence of out-group strangers, the presence of in-group strangers could effectively inhibit MH (no significant difference between participants reported and actual donation proportions was obtained). The results of experiment 2 replicated and extended the results of experiment 1, first by showing that the presence of in-group strangers could effectively inhibit MH and then by revealing the influence of present strangers' behavior (moral or hypocritical) on MH. The results indicated that strangers' moral behavior could effectively eliminate participants' MH, especially in the presence of in-group strangers. However, when present strangers exhibited hypocritical behavior, they exhibited no effect on participants' MH, irrespective of the condition of in-group and out-group strangers. The current study provides empirical support for theories related to MH and moral decision-making and contributes to the literature on in-group and out-group effects on MH and decision-making.",

The microexpression is recognized poorly when it follows a negative context in contrast to a neutral context. Based on the behavioral evidence, we predicted that the effect of emotional contexts might be dependent on neural activities. Using the synthesized microexpressions task modified from the Micro-Expression Training Tool (METT), we performed an functional MRI (fMRI) study to compare brain response in contrasts of the same targets following different contexts. Behaviorally, we observed that the accuracies of target microexpressions following neutral contexts were significantly higher than those following negative or positive contexts. At the neural level, we found increased brain activations in contrasts of the same targets following different contexts, which reflected the discrepancy in the processing of emotional contexts. The increased activations implied that different emotional contexts might differently influence the processing of subsequent target microexpressions and further suggested interactions between the processing of emotional contexts and of microexpressions.",

      "abstract": "Normative image sets are widely used in memory, perception, and language studies. Following the pioneering work of Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980), a number of normalized image sets with various language norms have been created. However, original image sets that are carefully selected to accommodate Chinese culture and language are still in short supply. In the present study, we provided the China Image Set (CIS), a new set of photo stimuli with Chinese norms. The CIS consists of 551 high-quality colored photo stimuli that cover 21 categories and are normalized on 12 different variables, including name agreement, category agreement, familiarity, visual complexity, object manipulability, manipulation experience, color diagnosticity, shape diagnosticity, image variability, age of acquisition, image agreement, and within-category typicality. Of the 12 variables, shape diagnosticity and manipulation experience with the object depicted in a stimulus are the two newly introduced and normalized variables. Multiple regression analysis reveals that name agreement, age of acquisition, image agreement, shape diagnosticity, and image variability are the most robust determinants of picture naming latency. Our normative dataset of the high-quality photo stimuli offers an ecologically more valid tool to study object recognition and language processing within Chinese culture than has previously been available.",

      "abstract": "Previous ERP researches showed that structure-based action representation was faster-rising in early object processing stage, but more evanescent than function-based action representation whose activation maintained in semantic processing stage (Lee et al., 2018). But function-based action representation also activated in early object processing and maintain in semantic processing in object naming (Sim et al., 2015). It was unclear whether structure-based action representation still activated in early processing and decayed in semantic processing in object naming. Besides, it was uncertain whether the activation of two action representations is accompanied by mu rhythm desynchronization in sensorimotor area, which was observed in manipulable object process (Proverbio, 2012). With a priming paradigm, a hand action movie clip and a manipulable object were presented sequentially and participants were asked to name the object after an answer cue as accurately as possible. The hand actions, including structure- and function-based actions, were congruent or incongruent with the following objects. ERPs and ERD over central-parietal scalp were measured to examine brain activation in object naming. The results showed that: 1) in early processing, no action priming effect was found; in P300 window, only structure-based action priming effect was found: P300 amplitude was marginally significantly positive in congruent than that in incongruent condition; in semantic processing, bilateral structure-based action priming effects and right-lateral function-based action priming effects were found: N400 amplitude was significantly negative in congruent than in incongruent condition. 2) In addition, mu rhythm desynchronization was only found in function-based action representation over left central scalp. The results suggested that: 1) even though structure-based action representation did not activate in early processing, its activation was still faster than that of function-based action representation, and both maintained in semantic processing in object naming; 2) mu rhythm desynchronization in function-based action representation inferred distinct mechanism of two action representations.",

      "abstract": "Time is generally conceptualized in terms of space as reflected in temporal-spatial metaphors. Two observation perspectives have been proposed in the front-back axis of the temporal-spatial metaphor. One is called \"ego-moving perspective\" and the other \"time-moving perspective.\" They are used to represent different relative motion between time and the observer. Previous studies have demonstrated the psychological reality of both perspectives. They also provided evidence that emotion can influence a perspective choice. In general, a positive emotion tends to facilitate the adoption of ego-moving perspective, whereas, a negative emotion tends to promote the adoption of time-moving perspective. However, it is unclear how the motivational dimension of emotion might influence the preference. The current study aimed to address the question by identifying conditions in which emotional valence or motivational attribute affects the choice of time movement perspective. An ambiguous temporal question and a visualized time motion schema were adopted to probe participants' metaphorical representation of time when they were affected by emotion. Study 1 investigated how a future emotional event would affect participants' choice of the time movement perspective. The results showed that positive future events led to a higher propensity to adopt an ego-moving perspective compared with negative future events. Study 2 explored participants' tendency to choose time movement perspective for a vague or neutral future event, after they were induced into a particular emotional state. The results showed that when being in an emotional state of approach-motivation individuals were more likely to adopt an ego-moving perspective. In contrast, being in an emotional state of avoidance-motivation, individuals were more likely to take a time-moving perspective. Taken together, these results suggest that the emotional valence of future events can influence the choice of time movement perspectives; and the motivational dimension of present emotional states plays an important role when contemplating a neutral future event.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) frequently occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD). Neurovascular changes interact with neurodegenerative processes in PD. However, the deficits of cerebral blood flow (CBF) perfusion and the associated functional connectivity (FC) in PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI) remain unclear. <b>Purpose</b>: This study aimed to explore the specific neurovascular perfusion alterations in PD-MCI compared to PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and healthy controls (HCs), and to further examine the resultant whole brain FC changes in the abnormal perfusion regions. <b>Methods</b>: Relative CBF (rCBF) was calculated using arterial spin labeling (ASL) in 54 patients with PD (27 patients with PD-NC and 27 patients with PD-MCI) and 25 HCs matched for age and gender ratio, who also underwent the structural MRI, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological examinations. The gray matter (GM) changes in PD patients were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The alterations in rCBF perfusion and FC among groups were then analyzed respectively. Additionally, correlations between these alterations and neuropsychological performances were further examined. <b>Results</b>: Compared to HC, left caudate atrophy was detected in patients with PD. In comparison to both PD-NC and HC, patients with PD-MCI specifically exhibited hypoperfusion in the parietal memory network (PMN) in the precuneus (PCu) and decreased PCu-FC in the right striatum. Moreover, PCu perfusion and PCu-FC strengths in the right striatum were positively associated with memory performance in PD-MCI. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that the posterior PMN dysfunction underlies memory deficits in PD-MCI.",

      "abstract": "Humans' perception of time has been observed to be distorted by emotions. Subjective distortion of time is typically modulated through experienced emotions and anticipated emotions. In this review, we distinguished the effects of experienced emotions and anticipated emotions on timing from the perspective of the ways that emotions take effect and cognitive mechanisms. According to the scalar expectancy theory, we proposed a new cognitive model to explain how emotions modulate the time perception in different time processing stages. Finally, we summarized the evidence of neurophysiology basis and brain mechanisms about emotional modulation of interval timing. Future researches are advised to further investigate and extend our understanding on the roles of anticipated emotions in driving emotion-induced temporal distortions, to find out the interactions of attention, arousal and valence, and to explore the neuropsychological mechanisms of emotional temporal distortions.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have found that the durations of fear-relevant stimuli were overestimated compared to those of neutral stimuli, even when the fear-relevant stimuli were only anticipated. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of the predictability of fear-relevant stimuli on sub-second temporal estimations. In Experiments 1a and 1b, a randomized design was employed to render the emotional valence of each trial unpredictable. In Experiments 2a and 2b, we incorporated a block design and a cueing paradigm, respectively, to render the emotional stimuli predictable. Compared with the neutral condition, the estimated blank interval was judged as being shorter under the unpredictable fear-relevant condition, while it was judged as being longer under the predictable fear-relevant condition. In other words, the unpredictable and predictable fear-relevant stimuli led to opposing temporal distortions. These results demonstrated that emotions modulate interval perception during different time processing stages.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tIn recent years, it has been proposed that sensory-motor experiences are often used to access concrete concepts, and the sensory-motor system is tightly related to the language system. Metaphors, which convey abstract concepts via concrete concepts, are common rhetoric in daily life. Exploring the role of the sensory-motor system in metaphor comprehension will lead to an improved understanding of the form and process of abstract concepts, and further elucidate the relationship between the sensory-motor system and the language system. In this paper, we summarize the experimental paradigm, cognitive features of sensory-motor metaphor comprehension, the mechanism of brain regions involved in sensory channels, action control and action performance during metaphor processing. We propose that the sensory-motor system selectively functions in metaphor comprehension, and the comprehension process relies on activities of sensory-motor regions, and the simulation of sensory-motor experience is not immediate and rapid but rather is influenced by language comprehension strategies. In the &amp;quot;Embodied abstraction&amp;quot; frame, &amp;quot;Simulated sensorimotor metaphor theory&amp;quot; further explains the interaction between the sensory-motor system and metaphor comprehension. Future studies are needed to verify and supplement these theories by adopting other analysis methods, and from other study perspectives like grammar, language acquisition and motion dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Abstract Micro‐expression recognition is influenced by emotional contexts at the behavioral level. It is found that the recognition for micro‐expressions is poorer following a negative context compared to the recognition following a neutral context. However, it remains unclear whether the modulation takes place in the early or later stage of the processing of micro‐expressions as reflected in event‐related potentials ( ERP s). Using synthesized micro‐expressions in this study, we investigated how emotional context modulates the ERP components that are elicited by micro‐expressions. We observed that, compared to neutral contexts, negative and positive contexts elicited more positive amplitude trends for processing the subsequent target micro‐expressions, and more positive P 1 and N 170 effects were elicited by target micro‐expressions following negative and positive contexts compared to those following neutral contexts. Moreover, there were larger P 1 effects elicited by the target micro‐expressions when the context and target expressions were incongruent compared to when they were congruent. Our findings provide new ERP evidence to indicate that emotional contexts modulate micro‐expression processing, and that the modulation of emotional contexts takes place at the early stage of facial‐expression processing.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression is a subtle and involuntary facial expression that may reveal the hidden emotion of human beings. Spotting micro-expression means to locate the moment when the micro-expression happens, which is a primary step for micro-expression recognition. Previous work in micro-expression spotting focus on spotting micro-expression from short video, and with hand-crafted features. In this paper, we present a methodology for spotting micro-expression from long videos. Specifically, a new convolutional neural network named spotting micro-expression convolutional network was designed for extracting features from video clips, which is the first time that deep learning is used in micro-expression spotting. Then, a feature matrix processing method was proposed for spotting the apex frame from long video, which uses a sliding window and takes the characteristics of micro-expression into account to search the apex frame. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a better performance than the existing state-of-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Deception has been reported to be influenced by task-relevant emotional information from an external stimulus. However, it remains unclear how task-irrelevant emotional information would influence deception. In the present study, facial expressions of different valence and emotion intensity were presented to participants, where they were asked to make either truthful or deceptive gender judgments according to the preceding cues. We observed the influence of facial expression intensity upon individuals' cognitive cost of deceiving (mean difference of individuals' truthful and deceptive response times). Larger cost was observed for high intensity faces compared to low intensity faces. These results provided insights on how automatic attraction of attention evoked by task-irrelevant emotional information in facial expressions influenced individuals' cognitive cost of deceiving.",

Traditional methods of spontaneous micro-expression recognition rely excessively on sophisticated hand-crafted feature design and the recognition rate is not high enough for its practical application. In this paper, we proposed a Dual Temporal Scale Convolutional Neural Network (DTSCNN) for spontaneous micro-expressions recognition. The DTSCNN is a two-stream network. Different of stream of DTSCNN is used to adapt to different frame rate of micro-expression video clips. Each stream of DSTCNN consists of independent shallow network for avoiding the overfitting problem. Meanwhile, we fed the networks with optical-flow sequences to ensure that the shallow networks can further acquire higher-level features. Experimental results on spontaneous micro-expression databases (CASME I/II) showed that our method can achieve a recognition rate almost 10% higher than what some state-of-the-art method can achieve.",

      "abstract": "Which is more detectable, the change of a consistent or an inconsistent object in a scene? This question has been debated for decades. We noted that the change of objects in scenes might simultaneously be accompanied with gist changes. In the present study we aimed to examine how the alteration of gist, as well as the consistency of the changed objects, modulated change detection. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the semantic content by either keeping or changing the consistency of the scene. Results showed that the changes of consistent and inconsistent scenes were equally detected. More importantly, the changes were more accurately detected when scene consistency changed than when the consistency remained unchanged, regardless of the consistency of the memory scenes. A phase-scrambled version of stimuli was adopted in Experiment 2 to decouple the possible confounding effect of low-level factors. The results of Experiment 2 demonstrated that the effect found in Experiment 1 was indeed due to the change of high-level semantic consistency rather than the change of low-level physical features. Together, the study suggests that the change of consistency plays an important role in scene short-term memory, which might be attributed to the sensitivity to the change of semantic content.",

      "abstract": "Recently research shows that activation of action representation is not always automatic, but influenced by some factors (Freeman, Itthipuripat, & Aron, 2016; Randerath, Martin, & Frey, 2013). Structure- and function-based action representations, which depend on distinct neural streams and represent different action information related to objects (Buxbaum & Kalénine, 2010), may be differently influenced by context and the level of object processing on their activation. In the present study, a behavioral experiment was conducted to explore whether structure- and function-based action representations could be activated in categorization task (low-level object processing) and naming task (high-level object processing). Participants were asked to categorize or name a photograph of an object preceded by a priming hand action video as quickly and as accurately as possible. The results showed that participants categorized the objects with congruent structure-based action faster than those with incongruent structure-based action, and this priming effect was significant only in the structure-based action priming block preceded by the function-based action priming block. Whereas, participants named the objects with congruent function-based action faster than those with incongruent function-based action. The findings suggested that the activation of structure-based action representation depended on the function-based action context，which may draw attention to the action information related to objects. The findings also suggested that low-level object processing in function-based action context was enough for the activation of structure-based action representation, and function-based action representation was only activated after high-level object processing. And the absence of structure-based action priming effect in naming task might be caused by the quick decay of structure-based action representation (Jax & Buxbaum, 2010). The present study provided further evidence for the activation condition of two action representations, and the distinction between the two action systems: \"Grasp\" and \"Use\" systems.

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tPURPOSE: Numerous studies had generally found that the perceived durations of fear-relevant stimuli were judged longer than those of the neutral ones. However, in our previous study, we found the blank durations presented before the fearful IAPS images were judged shorter than those of the neutral ones. Different from the emotional scenes, emotional faces contain more social information. In this study, we tried to investigate that whether the blank durations followed by fearful faces were perceived shorter than the neutral ones as the fearful scenes did.&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\tMETHODS: The fearful and neutral faces were selected from the Nimstim Face Stimulus Set. Twenty participants were allowed to judge the longer one in a pair of durations of the blank which were followed by a fearful face or a neutral face. One of the durations before faces (fearful or neutral) was randomly selected as the standard duration and presented for 1000 ms, and the other could be displayed for 400,600,800,1000,1200,1400,1600 ms. The results from the two-alternative forced-choice were fit with a function for each observer, and mean PSE (point of subjective equality) were calculated as the indicator of temporal compression or dilatation.&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\tRESULTS: One sample t tests revealed a significant positive PSE [t(19) = 2.49, p &amp;lt; .05], suggesting that the blank durations followed by fearful faces were perceived shorter compared to neutral ones.&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\tCONCLUSIONS: According to the SET model, the present study may reflect that the memory stage of timing was disturbed by fearful faces, and the pulses in working memory could not get access to comparator, leading to an underestimation of the blank durations relative to neutral faces.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tPURPOSE:: Deception detection studies had established that the detection accuracy was only slightly better than chance. The present study investigated whether deception detection could benefit from feedback treatment, and whether the effect would be modulated by cue modalities. Signal detection theory was applied to get deeper insights into the performance of deception detection.&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\tMETHODS: Typical lie detection tests were conducted. In the control condition, the participants passively observed totally 96 video clips of 6 models who were sometimes lying and sometimes telling the truth. The observers were asked to make judgement of whether the models were lying or telling the truth. In the feedback condition, after response, a right or wrong outcome feedback was given. In both conditions, participants completed lie detection tests via either visual modality cues or audiovisual modality cues separately in two successive weeks. The order was counterbalanced between participants.&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\tResults: The overall accuracy results showed that the main effects of feedback and cue modalities were significant, but there&amp;rsquo;s no interaction between feedback and cue modalities. Separating performance into deceptive and truthful targets, one intriguing finding was the significant feedback &amp;times; cue modalities &amp;times; type of stimulus (deceptive vs. truthful) interaction effect. Signal detection theory analysis revealed that feedback treatment enhanced perceptual sensitivity, and led to a more liberal response criterion in both the visual cues based and the audiovisual cues based lie detection tests.&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\tConclusions: The results suggested that feedback treatment benefited the overall accuracy of deception detection. The feedback effects performed differently on the visual and audiovisual modalities depending on the type of stimulus. Furthermore, signal detection theory analysis suggested that the feedback effects on the overall accuracy might result from the enhanced perceptual sensitivity and the more liberal criterion.&lt;/p&gt;",

The present research investigated individuals' awareness of their own facial expressions and the influence of the duration and intensity of expressions in two self-reference modalities, a real-time condition and a video-review condition. The participants were instructed to respond as soon as they became aware of any facial movements. The results revealed that awareness rates were 57.79% in the real-time condition and 75.92% in the video-review condition. The awareness rate was influenced by the intensity and (or) the duration. The intensity thresholds for individuals to become aware of their own facial expressions were calculated using logistic regression models. The results of Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) revealed that video-review awareness was a significant predictor of real-time awareness. These findings extend understandings of human facial expression self-awareness in two modalities.",

      "abstract": "Facial expression recognition is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that involves multiple, bilateral regions. There are six basic facial expressions that may be recognized in humans (fear, sadness, surprise, happiness, anger, and disgust); however, fearful faces and surprised faces are easily confused in rapid presentation. The functional organization of the facial expression recognition system embodies a distinction between these two emotions, which is investigated in the present study. A core system that includes the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 30), fusiform gyrus, and amygdala mediates the visual recognition of fear and surprise. We found that fearful faces evoked greater activity in the left precuneus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), middle frontal gyrus, and right lingual gyrus, whereas surprised faces were associated with greater activity in the right postcentral gyrus and left posterior insula. These findings indicate the importance of common and separate mechanisms of the neural activation that underlies the recognition of fearful and surprised faces.",

      "abstract": "It remains controversial whether visual awareness is correlated with early activation indicated by VAN (visual awareness negativity), as the recurrent process hypothesis theory proposes, or with later activation indicated by P3 or LP (late positive), as suggested by global workspace theories. To address this issue, a backward masking task was adopted, in which participants were first asked to categorize natural scenes of color photographs and line-drawings and then to rate the clarity of their visual experience on a Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS). The interstimulus interval between the scene and the mask was manipulated. The behavioral results showed that categorization accuracy increased with PAS ratings for both color photographs and line-drawings, with no difference in accuracy between the two types of images for each rating, indicating that the experience rating reflected visibility. Importantly, the event-related potential (ERP) results revealed that for correct trials, the early posterior N1 and anterior P2 components changed with the PAS ratings for color photographs, but did not vary with the PAS ratings for line-drawings, indicating that the N1 and P2 do not always correlate with subjective visual awareness. Moreover, for both types of images, the anterior N2 and posterior VAN changed with the PAS ratings in a linear way, while the LP changed with the PAS ratings in a non-linear way, suggesting that these components relate to different types of subjective awareness. The results reconcile the apparently contradictory predictions of different theories and help to resolve the current debate on neural correlates of visual awareness.",

      "abstract": "Deception is a very common phenomenon and its detection can be beneficial to our daily lives. Compared with other deception cues, micro-expression has shown great potential as a promising cue for deception detection. The spotting and recognition of micro-expression from long videos may significantly aid both law enforcement officers and researchers. However, database that contains both micro-expression and macro-expression in long videos is still not publicly available. To facilitate development in this field, we present a new database, Chinese Academy of Sciences Macro-Expressions and Micro-Expressions (CAS(ME)(2)), which provides both macro-expressions and micro-expressions in two parts (A and B). Part A contains 87 long videos that contain spontaneous macro-expressions and micro-expressions. Part B includes 300 cropped spontaneous macro-expression samples and 57 micro-expression samples. The emotion labels are based on a combination of action units (AUs), self-reported emotion for every facial movement, and the emotion types of emotion-evoking videos. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) was employed for the spotting and recognition of macro-expressions and micro-expressions and the results were reported as a baseline evaluation. The CAS(ME)(2) database offers both long videos and cropped expression samples, which may aid researchers in developing efficient algorithms for the spotting and recognition of macro-expressions and micro-expressions.",

      "abstract": "Artifacts (e.g., chair, desk, books) are closely related with peoples' daily life.Evidences have been accumulated from behavior experiment, brain damage patient, and neural functional imaging to show that the cognitive neural processing mechanisms are different for artifacts and natural kinds.The intention-based model assumes that people categorize an objects' by reasoning the creator's intent.Evidence for this model are about \"intended function\" effect in categorization, naming, and reasoning studies.However, the utility-based model assumes that using-goal is determining how people categorize an object.The interaction between people and objects make object's properties related the using-goal so that the semantic organization of an artifact concept is coherent.This model can explain evidence from study on both intended function and non-intended function.From a third-party perspective, the commonalty of these two models is that they are both purpose-based and the key difference between them is that the creator's versus the user's purpose influences artifact concept's categorization and reasoning.Previous studies used a natural language depiction-based free naming task but seldom separate syntactic component from the semantic component in these depictions.In this study, we recruited 96 participants and manipulated the plausibility of 6 objects' function by creating plausible and implausible versions of function depiction to explore how the plausibility of an object's function affects participants' categorization judgment.The study had two key findings: The plausibility of an object's function affects participants' naming, rating, and reasoning of an artifact.Participants categorize ambiguous depictions of objects as artifacts when objects' function is plausible and categorize them as natural kinds when their function is implausible.The correlation analysis showed that the more plausible an object's function is the higher possibility that participants categorize it as an artifact.In summary, presenting the semantic component of an object's function make ambiguous object categorized more as artifacts.Wang et al. found the role effect which showed that positive role word \"you\" can illuminate object history effect on categorization judgment.Namely, the role word can affect both the amount of function listed and the object categorization.These findings suggest that role word, object function, and categorization judgment are in a linear mediation relation: role word activate object function, and object function activation categorization judgment.In this current study, we directly probe and proved that the semantic component of object function has effect on artifact concept processing.If with the assumption that both the object man-made formation history and the second person role word can activate object function, then the purpose-based theory can explain both the formation effect and the role effect indicating that the two effects have a common mediating step: first to activate object's function, then have effect on next cognitive output.Therefore, this point developed the purpose-based model.",

We presented emotional pictures and self-referential stimuli (stimuli that accelerate and improve processing and improve memory of information related to an individual's self-concept) in sequence. Participants judged the color of the target stimulus (self-referential stimuli). ERP results showed that the target stimuli elicited larger P2 amplitudes under neutral conditions than under negative emotional conditions. Under neutral conditions, N2 amplitudes for highly self-relevant names (target stimulus) were smaller than those for any other names. Under negative emotional conditions, highly and moderately self-referential stimuli activated smaller N2 amplitudes. P3 amplitudes activated by self-referential processing under negative emotional conditions were smaller than neutral conditions. In the left and central sites, highly self-relevant names activated larger P3 amplitudes than any other names. But in the central sites, moderately self-relevant names activated larger P3 amplitudes than non-self-relevant names. The findings indicate that negative emotional processing could weaken the degree of self-reference effect.",

      "abstract": "Memory for actions is usually better following subject-performed tasks (SPT) than verbal tasks (VT). We hypothesised that enactment unitises the components of actions such that familiarity can support associative recognition following SPT. To examine this hypothesis, participants studied verb-object pairs in a SPT or VT condition. During testing, they discriminated between intact, recombined and new items and made Remember/Know judgments; additionally, their EEGs were recorded. Associative recognition was better following SPT than VT. Early frontal event-related potentials (ERPs) were graded according to the item status following SPT, but no such effects were found after VT. Similarly, the late parietal ERPs were graded following SPT, whereas these effects were smaller and did not differ between intact and recombined items following VT. We conclude that enactment unitised the action and object so that familiarity could contribute to associative recognition and that recollection became sensitive to the amount of the matching associative information.",

      "abstract": "There is growing evidence that human observers are able to extract the mean emotion or other type of information from a set of faces. The most intriguing aspect of this phenomenon is that observers often fail to identify or form a representation for individual faces in a face set. However, most of these results were based on judgments under limited processing resource. We examined a wider range of exposure time and observed how the relationship between the extraction of a mean and representation of individual facial expressions would change. The results showed that with an exposure time of 50 ms for the faces, observers were more sensitive to mean representation over individual representation, replicating the typical findings in the literature. With longer exposure time, however, observers were able to extract both individual and mean representation more accurately. Furthermore, diffusion model analysis revealed that the mean representation is also more prone to suffer from the noise accumulated in redundant processing time and leads to a more conservative decision bias, whereas individual representations seem more resistant to this noise. Results suggest that the encoding of emotional information from multiple faces may take two forms: single face processing and crowd face processing.",

      "abstract": "Previous research has proved that the action representation influences object recognition before the completion of object recognition, that is, within the first 150 millisecond (Kiefer, Sim, Helbig, & Graf, 2011). There are at least two kinds of action representation, structure-based and function-based action representation, depending on different neural streams (Rizzolatti & Matelli ,2003). Therefore, an ERP experiment was conducted to explore whether these two action representations can both influence object recognition before the completion of object recognition. With a priming paradigm, a hand posture picture and a manipulable object were presented sequentially and participants were asked to name the object when a question mark was presented, during which ERPs were measured to examine brain activation. The results showed that there was a function-based action priming effect over the central scalp as early as 70 millisecond after the onset of target objects, that is, the mean amplitude with congruent function-based action pictures was significant larger than that with incongruent function-based action pictures in central scalp. Whereas, the difference between congruent and incongruent trials was not significant in structure-based action priming condition. The mean amplitude of N1 in the function-based action priming condition over the parietal scalp in the early stage of object recognition was significant larger than that in the structure-based action priming condition. These results indicate that function-based action representation is activated in the early recognition stage, and functions before the completion of object recognition, while the structure-based action representation cannot. The findings suggest that the activation time of these two action representation are different and that function-based action representation is perhaps more important to object recognition. The present study provides further evidence for the distinction between two action systems: \"Grasp\" and \"Use\" system. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2016",

      "abstract": "People can learn values of objects with only minimal exposure to mildly affective cues, which is known as minimal affective learning (Bliss-Moreau, Barrett, & Wright, 2008). The inclusion/exclusion (I/E) model in evaluative judgment assumes that the instant judgement of an object can be influenced by the enviromental information: information that can be used in forming a representation of the target results in assimilation effects; information that cannot be used in forming a representation of the target would results in contrast effects (Bless & Schwarz, 2010). In previous studies of minimal affective learning, affective stimuli, such as the sentences describing behavior in face-sentence pairs, can always be used to form the representation of the neutral objects. Hence, the I/E model provides an assimilation effect account for minimal affective learning. Following this rationale, if the affective stimulus cannot be used to represent the neutral object during affective learning, there would be a contrast effect. As a result, the neutral object would acquire the opposite value of the paired stimulus, which would lead to an \"inversed affective learning\", as defined in this study. To test this prediction, face pairs with varied facial attractiveness were adopted in two experiments. After being presented ordinary neutral faces paired with one (Experiment 1) or four (Experiment 2) attractive faces or unattractive faces four times, participants were asked to judge the valence of the isolated neutral faces. Experiment 1 revealed an inversed affective learning. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that there was a stronger effect when the affective stimuli are stronger. This study initially illustrates that neutral objects can acquire the opposite value from affective stimuli through a new minimal affective learning mechanism, and provided a new perspective to affective learning.

      "abstract": "Microexpressions are fleeting facial expressions that are important for judging people's true emotions. Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition of microexpressions (with duration of less than 200 ms) and macroexpressions (with duration of greater than 200 ms). We used an affective priming paradigm in which a picture of a facial expression is the prime and an emotional word is the target, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine neural activities associated with recognizing microexpressions and macroexpressions. The results showed that there were significant main effects of duration and valence for N170/vertex positive potential. The main effect of congruence for N400 is also significant. Further, sLORETA showed that the brain regions responsible for these significant differences included the inferior temporal gyrus and widespread regions of the frontal lobe. Furthermore, the results suggested that the left hemisphere was more involved than the right hemisphere in processing a microexpression. The main effect of duration for the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was significant, and the theta oscillations (4 to 8 Hz) increased in recognizing expressions with a duration of 40 ms compared with 300 ms. Thus, there are different EEG/ERPs neural mechanisms for recognizing microexpressions compared to recognizing macroexpressions.",

Because negative emotions are perceptually similar, they cause high categorization demands. Elderly people may need more evidence in favor of the target emotion than younger people, and they make mistakes if this surplus of evidence is missing. In contrast, perceptually distinct happy faces were easily identified, and elderly people only failed when the presentation time was too short for their slower perceptual processing.",

      "abstract": "It remains unclear whether probabilistic category learning in the feedback-based weather prediction task (FB-WPT) can be mediated by a non-declarative or procedural learning system. To address this issue, we compared the effects of training time and verbal working memory, which influence the declarative learning system but not the non-declarative learning system, in the FB and paired-associate (PA) WPTs, as the PA task recruits a declarative learning system. The results of Experiment 1 showed that the optimal accuracy in the PA condition was significantly decreased when the training time was reduced from 7 to 3 s, but this did not occur in the FB condition, although shortened training time impaired the acquisition of explicit knowledge in both conditions. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the concurrent working memory task impaired the optimal accuracy and the acquisition of explicit knowledge in the PA condition but did not influence the optimal accuracy or the acquisition of self-insight knowledge in the FB condition. The apparent dissociation results between the FB and PA conditions suggested that a non-declarative or procedural learning system is involved in the FB-WPT and provided new evidence for the multiple-systems theory of human category learning.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;A majority of video summarization systems use linear representations, such as rectangular storyboards and timelines at linear scales. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear dynamic representation called SpiralTape that summarizes a video in a smooth spiral pattern. SpiralTape provides an unusual and fresh activity suitable for stimulating environments such as science and technology museums, in which children or young individuals can have enjoyable experiences that create meaningful learning outcomes. In addition, SpiralTape provides an uninterrupted overall structure of video content and takes design principles including compactness, continuity, efficient overview, and interactivity into consideration. A working SpiralTape system was developed and deployed in pilot applications and exhibitions. Elaborate user studies with evaluation benchmarks on multiple metrics were conducted to compare SpiralTape with two representative linear video summarization methods and a state-of-the-art radial video visualization. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and natural interaction performance of SpiralTape.&lt;/p&gt;",

It has been evident for enhanced recognition of other-race faces with positive or negative emotions, but it remains unclear whether categorization of other-race faces receive similar impact from emotions. This study was to examine how emotions modualtes the categorization of other-race faces. Experiment 1 asked young participants to categorize faces with neutral, positive or negative expressions by their race, and found both positive and negative expressions slowed down the categorization of other-race faces and weakened the other-race categorization advantage. Experiment 2 recruited elders to judge the race of faces, and found they categorized other-race faces more slower, and the other-race categorization advantage was weakened by negative expressions to a greater extent for elders than for youngers. These results provided further evidence for the hypothesis of the competition between individual identity process and categorization process, which was a common implication of several theories on other-race categorization advantage.",

      "abstract": "Implied action is defined as extraction of action information from a stationary photo. By using central cuing versions of the non-predictive and counter-predictive covert-orienting paradigms, the present study firstly investigated the attention shiftsinduced by the implied action and non-action cues. Then we further tested whether these cues produce reflexive or voluntary shifts of attention. In experiment 1 and 2, by using the non-predictive paradigm, we found that the throwing cue (implied action) directs spatial attention, irrespective of an abrupt onset target attracting attention. In experiment 3, by adopting a counter-predictive task, the results showed that implied action cues trigger attention shifts voluntarily. Moreover, the results in all three experiments revealed that trunk orientation alone (standing cue) is not sufficient to shiftone&amp;#39;s spatial attention. The present study extends the view of &amp;quot;direction of attention detector&amp;quot;, and further suggests that implied action as global body posture cue, the orienting mechanism might be different from that induced by local biological cues.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have proposed that the culture in which we are raised shapes the way that we attend to the objects and events that surround us. What remains unclear, however, is how early any such culturally-inflected differences emerge in development. Here, we address this issue directly, asking how 24-month-old infants from the US and China deploy their attention to objects and actions in dynamic scenes. By analyzing infants' eye movements while they observed dynamic scenes, the current experiment revealed striking convergences, overall, in infants' patterns of visual attention in the two communities, but also pinpointed a brief period during which their attention reliably diverged. This divergence, though modest, suggested that infants from the US devoted relatively more attention to the objects and those from China devoted relatively more attention to the actions in which they were engaged. This provides the earliest evidence for strong overlap in infants' attention to objects and events in dynamic scenes, but also raises the possibility that by 24 months, infants' attention may also be shaped subtly by the culturally-inflected attentional proclivities characteristic of adults in their cultural communities.",

Though 'emotion' is not directly named in the abstract or concepts, self-control's role in regulating affective responses (e.g., guilt, anxiety during deception) places it within the broader affective/emotion-related research domain.",

However, the role of action simulation in metaphor comprehension is still controversial. The present study examined the role of action simulation in Chinese metaphor comprehension by action-sentence compatibility task. Participants were asked to respond by a hand or foot when the sentence was meaningful. The results showed that the responses to foot-related metaphorical sentences were significantly slower than those to hand-related and mouth-related metaphorical sentences when using a foot to respond. We speculated that hand action were overlearned and overused in daily life, therefore there was no inhibition of hand action simulation to the responses of hands, but only inhibition of foot action simulation to the responses of feet. In addition, there was no inhibition in literal sentence comprehension, which implied that implicit action simulation was more necessary in abstract metaphor comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are brief involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions and, thus, help detect lies. Because of their many promising applications, they have attracted the attention of researchers from various fields. Recent research reveals that two perceptual color spaces (CIELab and CIELuv) provide useful information for expression recognition. This paper is an extended version of our International Conference on Pattern Recognition paper, in which we propose a novel color space model, tensor independent color space (TICS), to help recognize micro-expressions. In this paper, we further show that CIELab and CIELuv are also helpful in recognizing micro-expressions, and we indicate why these three color spaces achieve better performance. A micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e., a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture and independent color components achieves a higher accuracy than does that of RGB. In addition, we define a set of regions of interests (ROIs) based on the facial action coding system and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. Experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performances for TICS, CIELab, and CIELuv are better than those for RGB or gray.",

      "abstract": "A recent study has suggested that statistical representations of ensemble objects may provide contextual stability to facilitate perception. The present study investigated whether facilitating such perception occurs in the extraction of variability information and how the stability of context mean values influences variability perception. We designed two tasks in which participants directly judged the variability of stimuli. In Experiment 1, we manipulated both the stability of the mean values and the exposure time to observe the time course of stability facilitation. In Experiment 2, we decomposed the stability of the context mean values into between-trials and within-trial levels to further investigate the mechanism of such facilitation. The results revealed that stable mean contexts do facilitate variability perception. In particular, unstable long-term mean context causes loss of sensitivity to variability whereas response bias is determined by the interaction between long-term and transient mean stability.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are brief facial movements characterized by short duration, involuntariness and low intensity. Recognition of spontaneous facial micro-expressions is a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Main Directional Mean Optical-flow (MDMO) feature for micro-expression recognition. We apply a robust optical flow method on micro-expression video clips and partition the facial area into regions of interest (ROIs) based partially on action units. The MDMO is a ROI-based, normalized statistic feature that considers both local statistic motion information and its spatial location. One of the significant characteristics of MDMO is that its feature dimension is small. The length of a MDMO feature vector is 36 x 2 = 72, where 36 is the number of ROIs. Furthermore, to reduce the influence of noise due to head movements, we propose an optical-flow-driven method to align all frames of a micro-expression video clip. Finally, a SVM classifier with the proposed MDMO feature is adopted for micro-expression recognition. Experimental results on three spontaneous micro-expression databases, namely SMIC, CASME and CASME II, show that the MDMO can achieve better performance than two state-of-the-art baseline features, i.e., LBP-TOP and HOOF.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that action knowledge is an important part in the representation of object concepts and plays a role in the recognition of manipulable objects (Lin, Guo, Han, & Bi, 2011; Matheson, White, & McMullen, 2014). Action knowledge of manipulable objects regards how an object could be grasped, moved, and used. Further evidence from neuropsychological and brain imaging research has suggested that there are two kinds of action knowledge: function-based and structure-based action knowledge (Bub & Masson, 2013). Structure-based action refers to grasping an object and moving it, and function-based action refers to functionally using an object. Both types of action knowledge could be activated automatically during object processing, and they are independent of each other functionally and neuroanatomically (Bub & Masson, 2013; Jax & Buxbaum, 2010). However, their respective roles in object recognition is still unclear. In the present two experiments, static action pictures (Experiment 1) and dynamic action videos (Experiment 2) of structural versus functional hand gestures were used as primes to examine their respective roles in the recognition of manipulable target objects. Experiment 1 found that structural and functional hand gestures could facilitate the naming of manipulable objects to the same extent. However, Experiment 2 found that the prime effect of functional hand gestures on the naming of manipulable objects was much stronger than the effect of structural hand gestures. The findings indicated that both function-based action and structure-based action knowledge did play important roles in object recognition, but the facilitation effect of dynamic function-based action was more significant. The present research provided further evidence for the role of the dorsal pathway in object recognition that previously considered subserved only by the ventral pathway, and the distinction between the two action systems: “Grasp” and “Use” systems.

      "abstract": "The present study aims to determine the roles of color and other surface properties (e.g., texture, brightness) in rapid natural scene categorization. Six natural scene categories were adopted as stimuli. Each stimulus was in three versions: color photographs, grayscales, and line-drawings, with a resolution of 320 * 240 pixels. The line-drawings were produced by trained artists through tracing contours in the color photographs (see Walther et al., 2011). Each image was flashed for 13 ms, and then followed by 80 ms of masks and 500 ms of a blank. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the image and the mask was 13, 27, 40 or 200 ms at random. On each trial, participants were asked to make a choice among the six categories by pressing a corresponding key, during which EEGs were recorded. Each block included 84 trials. There were 12 blocks, for a total of 1008 trials. The behavioral results showed that accuracy was lower for grayscales than for line-drawings or color photographs in each SOA, meanwhile accuracies were higher for line-drawings than for color photographs in short SOAs of 13, 26, 40 ms. For correct trials, the ERP results revealed that there were no significant differences for amplitudes of posterior P1, N1, and P2 between grayscales and color photographs, but amplitudes of anterior P2, N2, and P3b were larger for color photographs than for grayscales. That is, color does not increase the difficulty of feature analysis, but contributes to decision making later. In addition, although amplitudes of posterior P1, N1, and anterior P2 were greater for grayscales than for line-drawings, conversely, amplitudes of posterior P2 and anterior N2 and P3b were larger for line-drawings than for grayscales. That is, although other surface properties increase the difficulty of feature analysis, they impair decision making for correct classification. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015",

A paucity of research exists concerning recognition of the fleeting expressions from different viewpoints. To investigate how duration and viewpoints together influence the expression recognition, we employed expressions with two different viewpoints (three-quarters and profile views) and showed them to the participants transiently. The duration of expressions was one of the following: 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, or 280 ms. In experiment 1, we used static facial expressions; In experiment 2, we added dynamic information by adding two neutral expressions before and after the emotional expressions. The results showed an interaction effect between viewpoint and duration on expression recognition. Furthermore, we found that happiness is the easiest expression to recognize even under the conditions of fleeting presentation and side-view. This study informed the automatic expression recognition of human data under conditions of short duration and different viewpoints.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that memory can be modulated by emotional stimuli at the time of encoding and consolidation. For example, happy faces create better identity recognition than faces with certain other expressions. However, the influence of facial expression at the time of retrieval remains unknown in the literature. To separate the potential influence of expression at retrieval from its effects at earlier stages, we had participants learn neutral faces but manipulated facial expression at the time of memory retrieval in a standard old/new recognition task. The results showed a clear effect of facial expression, where happy test faces were identified more successfully than angry test faces. This effect is unlikely due to greater image similarity between the neural training face and the happy test face, because image analysis showed that the happy test faces are in fact less similar to the neutral training faces relative to the angry test faces. In the second experiment, we investigated whether this emotional effect is affected by the expression at the time of learning. We employed angry or happy faces as learning stimuli, and angry, happy, and neutral faces as test stimuli. The results showed that the emotional effect at retrieval is robust across different encoding conditions with happy or angry expressions. These findings indicate that emotional expressions do not only affect the stages of encoding and consolidation, but also the retrieval process in identity recognition.",

With low-level and high-level stimuli, researchers usually employ four paradigms (i.e., freeze-frame, passively viewing, motion aftereffect, and fMRI adaption) to investigate implied motion. The role of attention and awareness in implied motion and the memory representation of implied motion are key issues in previous studies. Researchers also focus on the various activated brain regions engaged in implied motion, including medial temporal cortical areas (MT/MST), superior temporal sulcus, and mirrorneuron system. Future studies are needed to further explore the cognitive and neural mechanisms of implied motion in order to clarify whether motion and form processing in human visual system, especially the neural network for motion from form, are dissociated or integrated.",

According to the use of attentional resource, the mechanisms of SSR could be categorized into ensemble processing under distributed attention and individual processing under focused attention. Both mechanisms interact in the working memory, constructing the representation of multiple stimuli. SSR occurs across different stimulus types in both low-level and high-level processing, suggesting that it may be a common encoding method in perception. Future work on SSR may focus on its neural substrates and its impact on decision making.",

      "abstract": "The present study used a single-task paradigm in which participants received guidance to focus more attention (waiting for someone) on the temporal intervals in the \"waiting\" condition and to stay relaxed in the control condition. The reported time was longer in the waiting condition than in the control condition. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure simultaneously the activation levels of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for each condition. Greater oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) activation in the waiting condition was observed compared with the control condition, whilst deoxyhemoglobin data showed no difference between the two conditions. The gradual changes in oxy-Hb in the DLPFC in increments of 100 ms yielded further insights into the role of this region in the \"watched pot never boils\" phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "The timing intervals initiated by voluntary pressing actions are subjectively compressed compared with those initiated by voluntary releasing actions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were employed in the present study to uncover the temporal mechanisms underlying this temporal illusion. The results revealed that the mean amplitude of the P1 component over the frontal-central recording sites, but not the P2 component, was larger in the voluntary pressing condition than in the voluntary releasing condition at the time perception stage. In the fronto-central region, increases in oscillatory activities of delta-theta frequency range (1-7 Hz) were found in the voluntary pressing condition, which corresponded with the emergence of the P1 peak. In addition, the P1 amplitude was negatively related to the corresponding reported time length at the single-trial level. These results are discussed in terms of the functional role of the response-locked P1 in the time perception stage.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Micro-expression is a brief involuntary facial expression which reveals genuine emotions and helps detect lies. It intrigues psychologists and computer scientists&amp;#39; (especially on computer vision and pattern recognition) interests due to its promising applications in various fields. Recent research reveals that color may provide useful information for expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel color space model, Tensor Independent Color Space (TICS), for enhancing the performance of micro-expression recognition. An micro-expression color video clip is treated as a fourth-order tensor, i.e. a four-dimension array. The first two dimensions are the spatial information, the third is the temporal information, and the fourth is the color information. We transform the fourth dimension from RGB into TICS, in which the color components are as independent as possible. The combination of dynamic texture in the independent color components can get higher accuracy than that in RGB. In addition, we define a set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and calculated the dynamic texture histograms for each ROI. The experiments are conducted on two micro-expression databases, CASME and CASME 2, and the results show that the performance in TICS is better than that in RGB or gray.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of video resources, techniques for efficient organization of video clips are becoming appealing in the multimedia domain. In this article, a sketch-based approach is proposed to intuitively organize video clips by: (1) enhancing their narrations using sketch annotations and (2) structurizing the organization process by gesture-based free-form sketching on touch devices. There are two main contributions of this work. The first is a sketch graph, a novel representation for the narrative structure of video clips to facilitate content organization. The second is a method to perform context-aware sketch recommendation scalable to large video collections, enabling common users to easily organize sketch annotations. A prototype system integrating the proposed approach was evaluated on the basis of five different aspects concerning its performance and usability. Two sketch searching experiments showed that the proposed context-aware sketch recommendation outperforms, in terms of accuracy and scalability, two state-of-the-art sketch searching methods. Moreover, a user study showed that the sketch graph is consistently preferred over traditional representations such as keywords and keyframes. The second user study showed that the proposed approach is applicable in those scenarios where the video annotator and organizer were the same person. The third user study showed that, for video content organization, using sketch graph users took on average 1/3 less time than using a mass-market tool Movie Maker and took on average 1/4 less time than using a state-of-the-art sketch alternative. These results demonstrated that the proposed sketch graph approach is a promising video organization tool.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are often embedded in a flow of expressions including both neutral and other facial expressions. However, it remains unclear whether the types of facial expressions appearing before and after the micro-expression, i.e., the emotional context, influence micro-expression recognition. To address this question, the present study used a modified METT (Micro-Expression Training Tool) paradigm that required participants to recognize the target micro-expressions presented briefly between two identical emotional faces. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that negative context impaired the recognition of micro-expressions regardless of the duration of the target micro-expression. Stimulus-difference between the context and target micro-expression was accounted for in Experiment 3. Results showed that a context effect on micro-expression recognition persists even when the stimulus similarity between the context and target micro-expressions was controlled. Therefore, our results not only provided evidence for the context effect on micro-expression recognition but also suggested that the context effect might result from both the stimulus and valence differences.",

      "abstract": "A robust automatic micro-expression recognition system would have broad applications in national safety, police interrogation, and clinical diagnosis. Developing such a system requires high quality databases with sufficient training samples which are currently not available. We reviewed the previously developed micro-expression databases and built an improved one (CASME II), with higher temporal resolution (200 fps) and spatial resolution (about 280×340 pixels on facial area). We elicited participants' facial expressions in a well-controlled laboratory environment and proper illumination (such as removing light flickering). Among nearly 3000 facial movements, 247 micro-expressions were selected for the database with action units (AUs) and emotions labeled. For baseline evaluation, LBP-TOP and SVM were employed respectively for feature extraction and classifier with the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method. The best performance is 63.41% for 5-class classification.",

      "abstract": "As a general framework, Laplacian embedding, based on a pairwise similarity matrix, infers low dimensional representations from high dimensional data. However, it generally suffers from three issues: 1) algorithmic performance is sensitive to the size of neighbors; 2) the algorithm encounters the well known small sample size (SSS) problem; and 3) the algorithm de-emphasizes small distance pairs. To address these issues, here we propose exponential embedding using matrix exponential and provide a general framework for dimensionality reduction. In the framework, the matrix exponential can be roughly interpreted by the random walk over the feature similarity matrix, and thus is more robust. The positive definite property of matrix exponential deals with the SSS problem. The behavior of the decay function of exponential embedding is more significant in emphasizing small distance pairs. Under this framework, we apply matrix exponential to extend many popular Laplacian embedding algorithms, e.g., locality preserving projections, unsupervised discriminant projections, and marginal fisher analysis. Experiments conducted on the synthesized data, UCI, and the Georgia Tech face database show that the proposed new framework can well address the issues mentioned above.",

      "abstract": "摘要： 注视指向是非常重要的社会性注意线索, 但是在日常情境中, 注视指向往往伴随着头部朝向信息, 而且两者都包含空间指向信息。已有研究发现头部朝向会影响注视指向知觉的速度和准确性, 为注视指向提供参照系, 进而会影响注视指向诱发的社会性注意。头部朝向和注视指向加工的神经机制也存在着广泛的重合。因此, 除眼睛注视以外, 头部朝向也是建构和完善基于心理模型的社会性注意机制的一个关键因素。未来的研究应关注头部朝向与眼睛注视指向共同影响注意转移的作用机制, 并且从功能整合的角度开展神经机制研究。",

      "abstract": "Actions can be represented as a hierarchy of goals and means, whereas the granularity of the top level depends on the action's complexity. So far, most evidence comes from imitation studies. We explored this issue by evaluating the detection of means and end changes in a recognition paradigm across ages and cultures. German and Chinese preschoolers (n = 53) and adults (n = 58) studied videos of tool-use actions differing in complexity and familiarity. In the test phase, participants judged identical, means-changed and end-changed actions as same or different. Changes of the actions' end were generally identified more accurately independent of age and culture. Means' changes, but not ends' changes, were detected more frequently for complex than for simple actions. Changes in familiar actions were recognised better than changes in unfamiliar actions. The data supports a hierarchical model of action representation where the end information is superordinate to means information.",

It is unclear how these two subtypes of action information relate to each other with theoretical accounts postulating the superiority of end over means information and others linking separate means and end routes of processing to actions of differential meaningfulness. Action meaningfulness or familiarity differs between cultures. In a cross-cultural setting, we investigated how action familiarity influences recognition memory for means and end information. Object directed actions of differential familiarity were presented to Chinese and German participants. Action familiarity modulated the representation of means and end information in both cultures in the same way, although the effects were based on different stimulus sets. Our results suggest that, in the representation of actions in memory, end information is superordinate to means information. This effect is independent of culture whereas action familiarity is not.",

      "abstract": "The present study investigates the relationship between inter-individual differences in fearful face recognition and amygdala volume. Thirty normal adults were recruited and each completed two identical facial expression recognition tests offline and two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Linear regression indicated that the left amygdala volume negatively correlated with the accuracy of recognizing fearful facial expressions and positively correlated with the probability of misrecognizing fear as surprise. Further exploratory analyses revealed that this relationship did not exist for any other subcortical or cortical regions. Nor did such a relationship exist between the left amygdala volume and performance recognizing the other five facial expressions. These mind-brain associations highlight the importance of the amygdala in recognizing fearful faces and provide insights regarding inter-individual differences in sensitivity toward fear-relevant stimuli.",

At a short cue-target interval, the modulation of peripheral cueing over the spatial Stroop effect was observed independently of the presence/absence of placeholders. At the long cue-target interval, however, this modulation over the spatial Stroop effect only occurred in the placeholders-present condition. These findings show that placeholders are modulators but not mediators of the reduction of the spatial Stroop effect by peripheral cueing, which further favor the cue-target integration account.",

      "abstract": "Tensor subspace transformation, a commonly used subspace transformation technique, has gained more and more popularity over the past few years because many objects in the real world can be naturally represented as multidimensional arrays, i.e. tensors. For example, a RGB facial image can be represented as a three-dimensional array (or 3rd-order tensor). The first two dimensionalities (or modes) represent the facial spatial information and the third dimensionality (or mode) represents the color space information. Each mode of the tensor may express a different semantic meaning. Thus different transformation strategies should be applied to different modes of the tensor according to their semantic meanings to obtain the best performance. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing tensor subspace transformation algorithm which implements different transformation strategies on different modes of a tensor accordingly. In this paper, we propose a fusion tensor subspace transformation framework, a novel idea where different transformation strategies are implemented on separate modes of a tensor. Under the framework, we propose the Fusion Tensor Color Space (FTCS) model for face recognition.",

      "abstract": "Binding effect refers to the perceptual attraction between an action and an outcome leading to a subjective compression of time. Most studies investigating binding effects exclusively employ the \"pressing\" action without exploring other types of actions. The present study addresses this issue by introducing another action, releasing action or the voluntary lifting of the finger/wrist, to investigate the differences between voluntary pressing and releasing actions. Results reveal that releasing actions led to robust yet short-lived temporal binding effects, whereas pressing condition had steady temporal binding effects up to super-seconds. The two actions also differ in sensitivity to changes in temporal contiguity and contingency, which could be attributed to the difference in awareness of action. Extending upon current models of \"willed action,\" our results provide insights from a temporal point of view and support the concept of a dual system consisting of predictive motor control and top-down mechanisms.",

A strong focus for this debate has been a well-documented difference in early word learning: Infants’ success in learning verbs lags behind their success in learning nouns. In this review, we articulate both sides of the debate and summarize new cross-linguistic evidence from infants that underscores the role of universal features and begins to clarify the impact of distinctly different languages on early language and conceptual development.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions are facial expressions which are fleeting and reveal genuine emotions that people try to conceal. These are important clues for detecting lies and dangerous behaviors and therefore have potential applications in various fields such as the clinical field and national security. However, recognition through the naked eye is very difficult. Therefore, researchers in the field of computer vision have tried to develop micro-expression detection and recognition algorithms but lack spontaneous micro-expression databases. In this study, we attempted to create a database of spontaneous micro-expressions which were elicited from neutralized faces. Based on previous psychological studies, we designed an effective procedure in lab situations to elicit spontaneous micro-expressions and analyzed the video data with care to offer valid and reliable codings. From 1500 elicited facial movements filmed under 60fps, 195 micro-expressions were selected. These samples were coded so that the first, peak and last frames were tagged. Action units (AUs) were marked to give an objective and accurate description of the facial movements. Emotions were labeled based on psychological studies and participants' self-report to enhance the validity.",

      "abstract": "3-D CAD models are an important digital resource in the manufacturing industry. 3-D CAD model retrieval has become a key technology in product lifecycle management enabling the reuse of existing design data. In this paper, we propose a new method to retrieve 3-D CAD models based on 2-D pen-based sketch inputs. Sketching is a common and convenient method for communicating design intent during early stages of product design, e.g., conceptual design. However, converting sketched information into precise 3-D engineering models is cumbersome, and much of this effort can be avoided by reuse of existing data. To achieve this purpose, we present a user-adaptive sketch-based retrieval method in this paper. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we propose a statistical measure for CAD model retrieval: the measure is based on sketch similarity and accounts for users' drawing habits. Second, for 3-D CAD models in the database, we propose a sketch generation pipeline that represents each 3-D CAD model by a small yet sufficient set of sketches that are perceptually similar to human drawings. User studies and experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the design process are presented.",

      "abstract": "Using Garner's speeded classification task existing studies demonstrated an asymmetric interference in the recognition of facial identity and facial expression. It seems that expression is hard to interfere with identity recognition. However, discriminability of identity and expression, a potential confounding variable, had not been carefully examined in existing studies. In current work, we manipulated discriminability of identity and expression by matching facial shape (long or round) in identity and matching mouth (opened or closed) in facial expression. Garner interference was found either from identity to expression (Experiment 1) or from expression to identity (Experiment 2). Interference was also found in both directions (Experiment 3) or in neither direction (Experiment 4). The results support that Garner interference tends to occur under condition of low discriminability of relevant dimension regardless of facial property. Our findings indicate that Garner interference is not necessarily related to interdependent processing in recognition of facial identity and expression. The findings also suggest that discriminability as a mediating factor should be carefully controlled in future research.",

In two experiments,participants from two universities with similar ranks rated novel faces or names and then had a recognition test. Half of the faces or names were labeled as participants' own university and the other half were labeled as their counterpart. Results showed that, for either faces or names, rating scores for out-group members were consistently higher than those for in-group members, whereas the recognition accuracy showed just the opposite. These results indicated that the attitude and memory for group-relevant information might be dissociated among Mainland Chinese.",

      "abstract": "The effects of action complexity and familiarity on preschooler&amp;#39;s imitation performance were investigated. Thirty-two tool-use action video clips were imitated by 32 German and 32 Chinese preschoolers. Preschoolers&amp;#39; imitation performance was better for familiar as compared to unfamiliar actions and for simple as compared to complex actions. Furthermore, imitation errors were classified as means (action steps to reach the goal) errors and ends (action outcomes) errors. When imitating simple actions children made more means than ends errors, whereas more ends errors were made for complex actions. We explain this by the higher demands of processing complex actions on cognitive resources. This result highlights the important role of action complexity in children&amp;#39;s representation of the means and ends of tool-use actions. Performances showed a high cross-cultural stability, which indicates that imitation is a basic learning mechanism thereby uninfluenced by cultures.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT English-speaking children understand and produce generic expressions in the preschool years, but there are cross-linguistic differences in how generics are expressed. Three studies examined interpretation of generic noun phrases in three- to seven-year-old child ( N =192) and adult speakers ( N =163) of Mandarin Chinese. Contrary to suggestions by Bloom (1981), Chinese-speaking adults honor a clear distinction between generics (expressed as bare NPs) and other quantified expressions (‘all’/ suo3you3 and ‘some’/ you3de ). Furthermore, Mandarin-speaking children begin to distinguish generics from ‘all’ or ‘some’ as early as five years, as shown in both confirmation (Study 2) and property-generation (Study 3) tasks. Nonetheless, the developmental trajectory for Chinese appears prolonged relative to English and this seems to reflect difficulty with ‘all’ and ‘some’ rather than difficulty with generics. Altogether these results suggest that generics are primary, and that the consistency of markings affects the rate at which non-generic NPs are distinguished from generics.",

On the basis of this pattern of results, it argued that the affective priming effect was due to dual mechanism of both encoding facilitation and response competition. These results also indicated that repeated failures to find such effect using language stimuli were probably due to not taking the response competition process into account.",

      "abstract": "Earlier studies have demonstrated that spatial cueing differentially reduces stimulus–stimulus congruency (e.g., spatial Stroop) interference but not stimulus–response congruency (e.g., Simon; e.g., Lupiáñez &amp; Funes, 2005). This spatial cueing modulation over spatial Stroop seems to be entirely attributable to object-based attention (e.g., Luo, Lupiáñez, Funes, &amp; Fu, 2010). In the present study, two experiments were conducted to further explore whether the cueing modulation of spatial Stroop is object based and/or space based and to analyse the “locus” of this modulation. In Experiment 1, we found that the cueing modulation over spatial Stroop is entirely object based, independent of stimulus–response congruency. In Experiment 2, we observed that the modulation of object-based attention over the spatial Stroop only occurred at a short cue–target interval (i.e., stimulus onset asynchrony; SOA), whereas the stimulus–response congruency effect was not modulated either by object-based or by location-based attentional cueing. The overall pattern of results suggests that the spatial cueing modulation over spatial Stroop arises from object-based attention and occurs at the perceptual stage of processing.",

      "abstract": "With regard to the relationship between object and background perception in the natural scene images, functional isolation hypothesis and interactive hypothesis were proposed. Based on previous studies, the present study investigated the role of spatial frequency in the relationship between object and background perception in the natural scene images. In three experiments, participants reported the object, background, or both after seeing each picture for 500 ms followed by a mask. The authors found that (a) backgrounds were identified more accurately when they contained a consistent rather than an inconsistent object, independently of spatial frequency; (b) objects were identified more accurately in a consistent than an inconsistent background under the condition of low spatial frequencies but not high spatial frequencies; (c) spatial frequency modulation remained when both objects and backgrounds were reported simultaneously. The authors conclude that object/background interaction is partially dependent on spatial frequency.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Content‐aware image retargeting is a technique that can flexibly display images with different aspect ratios and simultaneously preserve salient regions in images. Recently many image retargeting techniques have been proposed. To compare image quality by different retargeting methods fast and reliably, an objective metric simulating the human vision system (HVS) is presented in this paper. Different from traditional objective assessment methods that work in bottom‐up manner (i.e., assembling pixel‐level features in a local‐to‐global way), in this paper we propose to use a reverse order (top‐down manner) that organizes image features from global to local viewpoints, leading to a new objective assessment metric for retargeted images. A scale‐space matching method is designed to facilitate extraction of global geometric structures from retargeted images. By traversing the scale space from coarse to fine levels, local pixel correspondence is also established. The objective assessment metric is then based on both global geometric structures and local pixel correspondence. To evaluate color images, CIE L*a*b* color space is utilized. Experimental results are obtained to measure the performance of objective assessments with the proposed metric. The results show good consistency between the proposed objective metric and subjective assessment by human observers.",

      "abstract": "We investigated whether the expertise of a perceiver and the physical complexity of a stimulus influence consolidation of visual short-term memory (VSTM) in a S1–S2 (Stimulus 1–Stimulus 2) change detection task. Consolidation is assumed to make transient perceptual representations in VSTM more durable, and it is investigated by postexposure of a mask shortly after offset of the perceived stimulus (S1; 17 to 483 ms). We presented colours, Chinese characters, pseudocharacters, and novel symbols to novices (Germans) or experts of Chinese language (Chinese readers). Physical complexity was manipulated by the number of strokes. Unfamiliar material was remembered worse than familiar material (Experiments 1, 2, and 3). For novices the absolute VSTM performance was better for physically simple than for complex material, whereas for experts the complexity did not matter—Chinese readers memorized Chinese characters (Experiment 3). Articulatory suppression did not change these effects (Experiment 2). We always observed a strong effect of SOA, but this effect was influenced neither by physical complexity nor by expertise; only the length of the interstimulus interval between S1 and the mask was relevant. This was observed even with short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 100 ms (Experiment 2) and in comparing colours and characters (Experiment 5). However, masks impaired memory if they were presented at the locations of the to-be-memorized items, but not beside them—that is, interference was location-based (Experiment 6). We explain the effect of SOA by the assumption that it takes time to stop encoding of information presented at item locations with the offset of S1. The increasing resistance against interference by irrelevant material appears as consolidation of S1.",

      "abstract": "When an emotion is concealed or repressed,the true emotion may be manifest as a micro-expression,a fleeting facial expression discordant with the expressed emotion,usually suppressed within 1/25 to 1/5 of a second,and closely related to the deception.This article is a review of all the studies reported about micro-expression.Earlier researchers focused on the measurement of abilities to recognize micro-expression.Because of the development of measurement tools,a large number of micro-expression recognition studies emerged within the clinical domain.However,only one published empirical study has explored the generation of micro-expression,and many questions are left unanswered.Further research should focus on the cross-culture validity of Micro-Expression Training Tool(METT),the generation of micro-expression,and the development of automatic micro-expression recognition tools.Micro-expression studies can provide important insights into the development of an automatic deception detection system.",

      "abstract": "Emotional stimuli have a priority to be processed relative to neutral stimuli. However, it is still unclear whether different emotions have similar or distinct influences on attention. We conducted three experiments to answer the question, which used three emotion valences: positive, negative and neutral. Pictures of money, snake, lamp and letter x were used as stimuli in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2A, schematic emotional faces (angry, smile and neutral face) were used as experimental stimuli to control the stimuli complexity. In Experiment 2B, stimuli were three line drawing pictures selected from the Chinese Version of Abbreviated PAD Emotion Scales, corresponding respectively to anger, joy and neutral emotion. We employed the paradigm of inhibition of return (IOR, an effect on spatial attention that people are slow to react to stimuli which appear at recently attended locations, cf. Posner & Cohen, 1984) which used exogenous cues and included 20% catch trials. Seventy-four university students participated in the experiments. We found that participants needed more time to process negative emotional pictures (Exp1, 2A&2B), and the effect of IOR could happen at the ISI (interstimulus interval) as short as 50ms (Exp1). Meanwhile, the data demonstrated that IOR happened at 50ms ISI only when the schematic face was angry, and RTs of angry schematic faces were significantly longer than RTs of the other two faces (Exp2A). We further found that the expectancy might play a role in explaining these results (Exp3). In all three experiments, we found consistently there was a U-shaped relationship between RT and ISI, irrespective of the cue validity and emotional valence. These results showed that different emotional valences had distinct influences on attention. To be specific positive and neutral emotions could be processed more rapidly than the negative emotion.",

      "abstract": "Concerning the influencing factors on judgments of learning (JOLs), this study focused on Koriat's cue utilization framework and the challenge from other research. Four experiments were conducted to examine the effects of the intrinsic (relatedness) and extrinsic cues (presentation order and presentation time) on JOLs. In the four experiments, 257 participants were required to predict the likelihood of recalling each item immediately after studying it. The results showed that the relatedness of two items in a pair as an intrinsic cue influenced JOLs no matter when it was a within-subjects factor or a between-subjects factor. The extrinsic cues, such as presentation order and presentation time, reliably influenced JOLs when a mixed-list method was adopted, which indicted that the extrinsic cues were not always discounted by JOLs. The longer the time that participants spent on making judgments was, the higher the JOLs were.",

It is investigated by post-exposure of a mask shortly after offset of memory array (S1). The memory performance increases as stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between S1 and mask array increases and finally reaches a asymptote level not influenced by the mask. It is considered that masks interfere the memory items representation into VWM in short SOA and that causes the consolidation phenomenon. Nevertheless, the question leaves open: how do masks interfere with this consolidation process. In this study, we tested whether masks overwrote the perceptual representation of memory items or competed with them for VWM representation. Masks interfered only when they appeared in the same location as memory items. We concluded that \"overwriting\", not \"competing\", characterized the VWM consolidation. Using the model \"boost and bounce theory of temporal attention\", we gave the explanation to that conclusion.",

We study influences by the configuration of distractors on the bias to perceive the orientation of a target. Our results show that: (a) when distractors are similar to each other but different from target, crowding is decreased; (b) when distractors form a subjective contour, crowding is also reduced. These results illustrate that crowding is weak whenever the target stands out from the context and strong when the target is grouped into the context as a part of a global percept. In addition, we show how a Bayesian model, based on the principle of spatial resolution of attention that is modulated by the large size of receptive fields, can account for the behavioral data.",

      "abstract": "It is generally assumed that \"perceptual object\" is the basic unit for processing visual information and that only a small number of objects can be either perceptually selected or encoded in working memory (WM) at one time. This raises the question whether the same resource is used when objects are selected and tracked as when they are held in WM. In two experiments, we measured dual-task interference between a memory task and a Multiple Object Tracking task. The WM tasks involve explicit, implicit, or no spatial processing. Our results suggest there is no resource competition between working memory and perceptual selection except when the WM task requires encoding spatial properties.",

      "abstract": "In the field of image quality assessment, to develop computerized/objective methods whose evaluations are in close agreement with human judgments becomes a main task. However, accurate evaluation of human&amp;rsquo;s subjective judgments is still a problem. Tradition methods based on mean opinion score (MOS) were not accurate enough, especially for images of minor changes or distortions. The present study tried to apply signal detection theory (SDT) in the field of image quality assessment, since SDT is particularly useful in measuring the way we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The results of three psychophysics experiments, in which images of different watermarking strengths were used as stimuli, showed that the SDT-based method was especially useful to detect the small loss of fidelity of images. This conclusion was supported by the higher correlation between the sensitivity score, P(A), with several computerized/objective QA indexes, such as PSNR, VIF and SSIM. Detecting subtle changes of images might involve some unknown implicit mechanisms for participants did not perform well enough in full-reference framework which allowing direct comparisons of the changed image to the original one.&amp;nbsp;",

Our results demonstrate that, in culturally homogeneous groups, individualism has a negative impact on the level of interpersonal trust; however, in culturally heterogeneous groups consisting of Chinese and U.S. participants, individualism has a positive impact on interpersonal trust among members. There were also significant differences in the level of trust between homogeneous Chinese groups and heterogeneous groups consisting of Chinese and U.S. participants. In addition, the mediating role of communication quality was identified to explain the effect for trust‐of social presence on trust. These findings have important implications on building and communication in global technology‐supported decision‐making groups.",

      "abstract": "Earlier studies have shown that the spatial Stroop effect systematically decreases when a peripheral precue is presented at the same location as the target, compared to an uncued location condition. In this study, two experiments were conducted to explore whether the cueing modulation of spatial Stroop is object based and/or space based. In Experiment 1, we found evidence favouring the view that the cueing modulation of the spatial Stroop effect is entirely object based, as no differences were found in conflict reduction for the same-location and same-object conditions. In Experiment 2, the cue was predictive, and a similar object-based modulation of spatial Stroop was still observed. However, the direction of such modulation was affected by the rectangles’ orientation. Overall, the pattern of results obtained favours the object-integration (Lupiáñez &amp; Milliken, 1999; Lupiáñez, Milliken, Solano, Weaver, &amp; Tipper, 2001) and referential-coding accounts (Danziger, Kingstone, &amp; Ward, 2001) and seems to provide evidence against the attention-shift account (Rubichi, Nicoletti, Iani, &amp; Umilta, 1997; Stoffer, 1991).",

However, scientific community surprisingly falls silent on this issue. The present research attempted to evaluate this idea critically using strictly controlled lab experiment. We found that men's performance in a commonly adopted cognitive test deteriorated when they were required to coordinate this primary test with a simple secondary test. In sharp contrast, women's performance on the very same test improved upon the inclusion of the secondary test. This surprising gender-specific pattern is suggestive of the involvement of cognitive control in the playing out of the putative gender discrepancy in multitasking. Though the present study does not speak directly to whether women do possess superior multitasking ability over men, the empirical data presented here is in alignment with the evolutionary speculation about this gender gap derived from the Hunter-Gatherer Hypothesis and point to a new venue for further research on this issue.",

In the experiment, stimuli were presented at two exposure durations (unlimited and 80 ms). Subjects had to decide whether or not a normal letter appeared at either level of a compound stimulus. The results showed when the exposure time was limited as 80ms, the subjects responded faster to global level of compound stimulus than to local level; when the exposure time was unlimited, the subjects' response to global level of compound stimulus and to local level was of no difference. Our findings were discussed in terms of the mechanism of perceptual global advantage.",

      "abstract": "Previous research revealed an interaction between eye gaze and emotional facial expressions. There are also evidences that elevated levels of trait anxiety are associated with an increased ability to accurately recognize facial expressions of fear, and enhanced cueing effect of eye gaze of fearful faces. In this study, we investigate the relationship between facial expression and gaze processing with the Garner selective attention paradigm, taking individual differences in trait anxiety into account. Results indicated that facial expression interferes with eye gaze judgments, but gaze does not influence perception of facial expressions. These findings were not stimulus-bound. Furthermore, no anxiety-related differences in the interactions were found. Thus, our study reveals that anxiety does not play an important role in the interaction between eye gaze and facial expressions. Previous findings that anxiety may facilitate cuing effect of gaze direction of fear faces might be task-bound.",

It is suggested that the processes that govern (a) input selection from the visual field and (b) dimensional selection from the stimulus might affect each other.",

      "abstract": "The effects of gaze direction on the perception of facial expressions have been getting more and more attention from psychologists, but their implication for facial expression recognition in computer science is neglected. In the present psychological study, we investigated the effects of gaze direction on the perception of facial expressions, and focused on the role of social dominance of facial expressions. Experiments 1 and 2 examined the effects of gaze on evaluations of dominance, pleasure and arousal of neutral, joy, angry and disgust facial expressions, using Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). Experiment 3 examined the influence of gaze direction on the efficiency of facial expression perception. The results indicated that (a) gaze direction influenced the dominance of neutral and angry facial expressions, while it did not influence the dominance of happy or disgust facial expressions; and (b) averted gaze facilitated the processing of angry faces. The results of three experiments suggested that for threatening facial expression (such as anger), social dominance might be the mediator in the effect of gaze on perception of facial expressions. The implication for facial expression recognition of computer science was discussed.",

Because of globalization, the use of cross-cultural teams in group tasks is becoming increasingly common. The objective of this study was to investigate how national culture, social presence, and group diversity may affect majority influence in a group decision-making context. A total of 183 groups participated in a large-scale empirical experiment at multiple sites. The results show that the national culture of group minorities has a significant impact on majority influence and that the use of computer-mediated communication can reduce majority influence. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications for improving the outcome and the effectiveness of group decision making in cross-cultural environments.",

      "abstract": "In this empirical study we examine the impact of national culture and social presence on interpersonal trust in both culturally homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. Results demonstrate that interpersonal trust is higher in homogeneous, low-individualism groups (represented by Chinese participants) than that in homogeneous, high-individualism groups (represented by U.S. participants); however, interpersonal trust in heterogeneous groups is lower for low-individualism than high-individualism group members. It is also found that social presence has a positive impact on interpersonal trust; however, a difference in social presence between groups supported by two collaborative technologies is not detected In addition, perceived communication quality is reported highest in face-to-face (FtF) groups without the support of collaborative software (CS), followed by FtF, CS-supported groups, and then virtual, CS groups. These findings have important implications for trust building in global groups as well as for the design of collaborative technologies in support of virtual groups. ©2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "To examine the effects of the distribution of sequential stimuli and interstimulus interval on the subjects' strategies for integrating information of two sequential dot arrays,12 undergraduate students were asked to perform empty cell localization task on computers.The results showed that the accuracy was approximate a U-shaped function of the number of dots in array 1,and the amounts of array 1 errors and array 2 errors increased as the number of corresponding dots in array 1 and array 2 increased.It was concluded that when the number of dots in array 1 was less than empty cells,the results supported the image-perception integration hypothesis and subjects would be more likely to remember the dot locations in array 1;when the number of the dot in array 1 was more than empty cells,the results supported the convert-and-compare hypothesis and subjects would be more likely to remember the unoccupied locations in array 1.",

However comparing, selecting, and composing of them usually go implicitly lacking systemic guidelines. In this paper a conceptual approach for MDSD process frameworks modeling is proposed. Taking three inter-discipline concepts, abstraction, generality, and behaviorism that are fundamental to mathematics, philosophy as well as computer science as comparison dimensions, development techniques are compared in both static and dynamic facets of MDSD processes. An experimental method for composing them into development process frameworks is also given. This work potentially will be beneficial to meet nonfunctional software performance requirements on MDSD processes such as improving efficiency, traceability, and ensuring consistency etc.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to address questions on how collectivistic and individualistic cultures affect majority influence in a group decision making task when there are differences in media richness. We developed a theory that explains and predicts these phenomena, and tested hypotheses using 112 four-person groups that consisted of Chinese and U.S. participants. As predicted, we found strong evidence indicating that there were significant differences between Chinese and U.S. groups, with Chinese groups being more prone to follow the view of majority. Further, traditional face-to-face (FtF) unsupported groups experienced the strongest majority influence. We found that GSS use helped diminish majority influence in both Chinese and U.S. groups. These findings have broad theoretical and applied implications, which are discussed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a defacto notation for model driven software development (MDSD), emphasizing on model to model refinements and transformations. However UML may not be expressive enough to describe all aspects as required by recent MDSD models. A noticeable weakness is its inability to express the ontological concepts often encountered in MDSD. In this paper, we propose an extended Entity-Relationship (ER) model called Runtime Entity-Relationship model (RER) for ontological modeling of common MDSD concepts. Different layers of the UML metamodel hierarchy are analyzed in the context of modeling the MDSD using the RER model. Modifications of the UML architecture for more precise modeling of MDSD are suggested.",

This may hinder the advancement of the automation level of MDSD with problems such as defining the boundaries of automation tasks, and measuring the workload for model transformations (MT), etc. In common senses, the two parts are not distinguishable because they belong to irrespective subjective and objective conceptual areas respectively. By discussing this issue specifically for MDSD, a conceptual exclusion approach for differentiation based on an extended Entity Relationship (ER) model is proposed. A conceptual framework called MIB/CSD (manual work, inheritance, behaviorism / cardinality, static, dynamic) to implement the differentiation approach is designed. Feasibility of the differentiation work with regard to UML is discussed in both the theoretical aspect with the extended ER model and the practical aspect with some existing evidences.",

In this paper, we present an indepth analysis of the major causes leading to the ambiguities of existing transformation. A metamodel based approach is then proposed to address these causes, A mechanism to generate transformation rules is devised based on a classification of the UML metamodel elements to be used in subsequent transformation processes. Some other critical issues relating to the generated transformation system are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Tversky's (1977) diagnosticity principle implies that categorization affects similarity, and that similarity in turn is based on context. However, Nisbett, Peng, Choi, and Norenzayan (2001) suggest that Chinese and Westerners differ in their sensitivity to context and categorization. Because of these differences, it is not clear whether Chinese should follow the diagnosticity principle. To explore these possibilities, we conducted a cross-cultural experiment using participants from Australia and China to repeat the experiment of Tversky (1977) using schematic faces as stimuli. Results showed that Australians, but not Chinese, made similarity judgments in a manner compatible with the diagnosticity principle. We suggest that: 1) the use of the diagnosticity principle depends upon contextual variables for Chinese people; and 2) Chinese participants judged neutral schematic faces as more positive than Western participants did.",

The Baylis' paradigm, in which subjects had to judge which of the two vertices of an object was higher, was applied to this study. The results shows that: a) If the vertices to be selected are in occluding-part of the object, responses are facilitated; while for the vertices in occluded-part, responses are inhibited. It indicates that the processing of shape perception is affected by self-occlusion; and b) Color has no effects on the vertices position judgment task.",

Views on the relation between the two pathways fall into two classes: traditional views that deny such a perception-action division, and cooperative views that emphasize interaction between the two systems. This article summarizes the key issues, empirical evidences, and contributions of each theory/view, and analyzes the conditions that visual processing takes place in a certain system, then concludes that the incomplete function division between the two systems leads to variety in visual processing.",

These cues were presented in three modes: between-participants, blocked-list, and mixed-list. The results showed that relatedness influenced JOLs no matter how it was presented. The time required to produce judgments was longer for unrelated items than for related items, which suggested that a mnemonic cue, namely ease of processing, might exert influence on JOLs. The effects of extrinsic cues were unstable in the present four experiments.",

Experiment 1 examined the effects of representation type (word-only versus word-plus-picture) and presentation channel (visual-only versus visual-plus-auditory) on recall and immediate-JOL in fixed-rate learning conditions. Experiment 2 examined the effects of representation type (word-only versus word-plus-picture) and presentation media (computer versus paper) on recall and delayed-JOL in self-paced learning conditions. The results showed that recall performance was better in word-only conditions than in word-plus-picture conditions in Experiment 1, and better in computer conditions than in paper conditions in Experiment 2. Multimodal information had no influence on magnitude of people's judgment. Participants were overconfident in all conditions, but more overconfident in computer conditions than in paper conditions.",

The development of modern economy provided not only fundamental conditions but also strong need for social education, which became a radical impetus to the emergence and development of social education. The appeal and shout of ambitious people stimulated by the national crisis, which led to the practice of different kinds of salvation and patriotic thoughts, and the rising and advancing of democratic politics promoted the emergence and development of social education. The rising and developing of modern new type of schools provided it with certain foundation, while their unavoidable limitations starved for remedy of social education. In addition, that all previous governments comparatively stressed and supported social education was also an important factor leading to its emergence and making it develop step by step.",

      "abstract": "The study assesses whether remotely located pairs of people working on a collaborative task benefit from using video or not. We look in particular at people's psychological functions as well as the sound delay time. In this study, we extend the research on video mediated communication (VMC) to the domain of interactions of psychological functions. Fourty-eight pairs of students performed a map task using either audio-only or audio-plus-video for communication. Half the pair were in the condition with 20 ms sound delay, half were in the condition with 1000 ms sound delay. We found a significant interaction among communication media, the sound delay time, and the subjects' psychological functions. Although as in many studies of video connectivity, no benefit from the video was found in four experimental conditions, the results indicate that video might matter when audio connectivity has a longer sound delay. Video connectivity might decrease the difference of task performance in two sound delay conditions. These results have important implications for people who have some types of psychological functions to communicate in different communication media conditions. Video connectivity may be beneficial for communication quality.",

      "abstract": "Psychological thinking in China originated 2000 years ago when Chinese philosophers debated about the goodness and evilness of human nature. In the 16th and 17th centuries the Jesuit missionaries introduced the Catholic scholastic psychology into China. Modern Chinese psychology was mainly introduced from Germany, America, and Japan in the early 20th century. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Chinese psychology tried to stage a reform by taking the psychology of the Soviet Union as its model. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) psychology was abandoned due to its Western roots. In the late 1970s psychology was rehabilitated and new fields were opened up for study. Currently, Chinese psychology is adopting a multi‐dimensional approach to meet the demands of China's modernization movement.",

      "abstract": "More and more organizations are forming teams that are not co-located. These teams communicate via email, fax, telephone and audio conferences, and sometimes video. The question often arises whether the cost of video is worth it. Previous research has shown that video makes people more satisfied with the work, but it doesnt help the quality of the work itself. There is one exception; negotiation tasks are measurably better with video. In this study, we show that the same effect holds for a more subtle form of negotiation, when people have to negotiate meaning in a conversation. We compared the performance and communication of people explaining a map route to each other. Half the pairs have video and audio connections, half only audio. Half of the pairs were native speakers of English; the other half were non-native speakers, those presumably who have to negotiate meaning more. The results showed that non-native speaker pairs did benefit from the video; native speakers did not. Detailed analysis of the conversational strategies showed that with video, the non-native speaker pairs spent proportionately more effort negotiating common ground.",

In this study, we extend the research on video-mediated communication to the domain of non-native speaker interactions. Thirty-six pairs performed a map task using either audio-only or audio-plus-video for communication. Half the pairs were non-native speakers, half were native speakers. As in many studies of video connectivity with native speakers, no benefit from the video was found. However, non-native speakers performed significantly better with a video connection than with audio-only.",

Experimental results showed that subjects produced three kinds of problem representations, corresponding to three kinds of solution strategies; namely, trial-and-error, concentration and decomposition. The three different problem representations reflected different cognitive levels achieved by the subjects in structuring the problem and determined which solution strategy the subjects employed. The three kinds of solution strategies exhibited different kinds of selectivity and different degrees of effectiveness.",
