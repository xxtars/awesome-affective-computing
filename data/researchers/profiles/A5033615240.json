A strong longitudinal trend emerges: evolving from unimodal emotion/sentiment analysis (2019–2022) toward foundation-model-ready, vision-language-affective integration (2023–2024), with increasing emphasis on neuro-inspired architectures, expert-curated benchmarks (e.g., AesBench), explainability, and empathy-aligned evaluation. Cross-cutting themes include subjective trait extraction, culture- and personality-aware personalization, and rigorous grounding in affective psychology and neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of environment-aware services in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), vehicles are required to execute multiple computational tasks in real time. However, resource allocation and task offloading in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted IoV systems remain challenging due to the growing number of vehicle terminals (VTs), potential privacy leakage, and resource-constrained edge devices. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT) and generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-powered hierarchical aerial-ground cooperative architecture (DTG-HACA) that achieves dynamic resource optimization through a three-layer framework. The DT layer enables real-time synchronization of vehicle/UAV states and simulated trajectory planning. The high altitude platforms (HAPs) layer provides low-latency offloading channels through stratospheric wide-area coverage and solar-powered endurance, while the physical entity layer executes energy-efficient edge computing via UAV-vehicle-roadside units (RSUs) collaboration. For UAV trajectory optimization, we introduce the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-improved prioritized experience replay (MADDPG-IPER) algorithm that minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption while integrating DT-simulated trajectory planning. For the joint challenge of edge caching and task offloading under privacy preservation constraints, we develop a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) based generative adversarial network (FDRL-GAN) algorithm. This solution addresses critical challenges in dynamic task offloading and resource allocation for UAV-assisted IoV by leveraging GAI to predict task demands for cache hit rate optimization, while implementing FDRL for distributed privacy-preserving decision-making without raw data sharing, thereby achieving global resource allocation optimality. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that our proposed scheme demonstrates significant advantages over existing benchmark algorithms across five critical performance metrics, including training stability, computational capacity, task offloading efficiency, cache hit rate, and energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of long Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for automatic and interpretable models that can evaluate the image-text alignment in long prompt scenarios. However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LongT2IExpert in alignment evaluation and interpretation. Data and code have been released in https://welldky.github.io/LongT2IBench-Homepage/.",

      "abstract": "Image retouching has received significant attention due to its ability to achieve high-quality visual content. Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Aesthetic Image Cropping (AIC) aims to improve the visual appeal of images by removing redundant content while preserving attractive elements. Despite the encouraging progresses achieved in data-driven approaches, most existing models struggle to understand user intentions, particularly for diversified scenes with multiple subjects. Moreover, they can only provide cropping results without explanations, which further restricts their usability in real-world applications. Motivated by the above facts, we introduce InstructCrop : a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based AIC framework, which can understand user instructions and provide explanatory reasons for cropping results. Specifically, we first build a multimodal Image Cropping Instruction Tuning (ICIT) dataset through a cost-effective paradigm by generating high-quality instruction tuning data based on the existing cropping datasets. Then, we embed dynamic domain knowledge into the cropping model by integrating cropping-aware experts of aesthetic assessment and composition classification. Finally, we adapt MLLMs to generate the cropping results and corresponding explanations. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that InstructCrop enables effective and interpretable image cropping, which aligns better with user intentions. Data and code are available at https://github.com/sxfly99/InstructCrop.",

To bridge this gap, this paper systematically investigates enhanced low-light image quality assessment from both subjective and objective dimensions. First, we introduce a Real-world Low-light Image Enhancement quality assessment dataset (RLIE), which contains 1540 images from 154 scenarios, each with a subjective score given by the subjects. Based on this, we propose a low light enhanced image quality assessment method based on Multi-level Illumination Injection and Hierarchical Discrepancy Perception (MIIHDP). The core idea of this method is to hierarchically inject separated illumination information into the feature extraction process, then tailor the processing of difference information at different scales to obtain a more comprehensive representation. Finally, extensive statistical analyses demonstrate the rationality of the proposed RLIE dataset, and experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed MIIHDP compared with state-of-the-arts. Our dataset and code are released at: https://github.com/BoHu90/RLIE.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in https://sxfly99.github.io/FGResQ-Homepage.",

      "abstract": "The inherent diversity of visual scenes poses a fundamental challenge in blind image quality assessment (BIQA), which has become a major obstacle to the model generalization. In this study, we found that human annotations for images with different visual scenes exhibit distinct quality distribution discrepancies. The existing BIQA models tend to overfit to such diversified distributions, which in turn leads to compromised model generalizability, especially when dealing with unseen scenes in the real-world scenario. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a generalizable BIQA model by learning Scene-INvariant Distribution, named SIND. Specifically, we propose a distribution alignment framework to alleviate the distribution discrepancy for quality regression models, which is achieved by automatically scaling and shifting the cross-scene distributions into a unified distribution. Then, the aligned unified distribution is leveraged to supervise the model training, achieving scene-invariant and quality-aware feature representation. In addition, a token-complementary patch reasoning network is designed to extract comprehensive quality-aware features from both the image overview and detail, achieving more accurate quality prediction. Extensive experiments for both image technical- and aesthetic-quality assessment tasks show the superiority of the proposed SIND model over the state-of-the-arts. Moreover, the proposed framework is model-agnostic and can enhance model generalizability without incurring extra inference costs. The proposed method won the championship in the NTIRE 2024 Portrait Quality Assessment Challenge. Codes will be available at https://github.com/ZachL1/SIND.",

      "abstract": "Image dehazing, as a typical representative of low-level vision tasks, holds significant importance, prompting the proposal of numerous dehazing methods. Given that none of these methods can perfectly restore all hazy images, developing robust objective assessment methods remains a critical research priority in this field. Most existing objective assessment methods for dehazed images fail to fully leverage haze-related features and instead rely on basic dehazed images alone. Additionally, they often neglect effective feature fusion, which severely limits model performance. To address these issues, we propose a dark channel difference driven dehazed image quality assessment with progressive injection (DCPI-DQA). First, a dark channel difference map is generated using both the dehazed image and the hazy image. Then, a two-stream multi-scale feature extraction network is employed to extract haze density features and dehazing-aware features. During the feature extraction process, haze density features are progressively injected into the dehazing aware features using the proposed progressive injection mechanism. Finally, multi-level fusion is applied for feature integration, and the quality score is obtained through quality regression. Experiments conducted on four publicly available dehazed image datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, cross-dataset experiments indicate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization. Code and resources are available at https://github.com/BoHu90/DCPI-DQA.",

      "abstract": "Wide-angle videos shot with short-focus lenses often exhibit deformation distortions, which poses significant challenges for video quality assessment (VQA). Although current VQA methods focus primarily on video content and distortion perception, there has been little explicit research on the impact of deformation characteristics on the perception of wide-angle video quality. To this end, this paper makes the first attempt to construct a novel wide-angle video quality assessment method based on deformation representation learning and multi-dimensional feature fusion, termed DRLMF. Specifically, we first analyze the deformation distribution characteristics of wide-angle videos based on the deformation camera model. Based on this, a three-stream video perception and assessment network is proposed. The first branch extracts global semantics using the image encoder of CLIP. The second branch introduces an effective deformation region selection strategy and proposes an interpretable deformation representation learning module. This module leverages the perception advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in local distortions and considers the correlation between patch size and distortion perception. The third branch extracts motion features using an action recognition network. Finally, an effective multi-dimensional feature fusion module is proposed to integrate more refined and richer semantic, deformation, and motion features. Extensive experiments on wide-angle VQA datasets and standard video datasets show that the DRLMF outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of prediction monotonicity and accuracy. The codes will be available at https://github.com/BoHu90/DRLMF.",

      "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generation models, AI-Generated Images (AGIs) still face significant challenges, such as poor perception quality and text-image misalignment. Consequently, AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (AGIQA), which aims to assess capabilities of generative models, has gained increasing attention. Diffusion models, pre-trained on large-scale text-image generative tasks, inherently encode rich prior knowledge regarding image quality and text-image alignment, which is crucial for AGIQA task. Inspired by this, unlike most existing CLIP-based methods, we present an initial exploration of diffusion model-based AGIQA, termed Diff-AGIQA. Specifically, to effectively harness pre-trained diffusion models, we introduce a simple yet effective strategy focusing on two key aspects: 1) feature selection, identifying the discriminative features within diffusion models; and 2) visual prompting, to extract more task-specific features while keeping the diffusion model frozen. Extensive experiments on AGIQA-1K, AGIQA-3K, AGIQA-20K, and RichHF-18K datasets demonstrate the potential of applying diffusion models to AGIQA task. Code is publicly available https://github.com/sxfly99/Diff-AGIQA.",

      "abstract": "Medical image fusion (MIF) plays an important role in precision diagnostics and treatment planning management, and medical image fusion quality assessment (MIFQA) has an aggressive effect in improving MIF performance. However, obtaining medical reference images is difficult, and the significant demand for medical prior knowledge and reference images is an important challenge in the field of MIFQA. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage model for MIFQA. In the first stage, we design a GAN-based Quality-aware Network called QANet. By fusing the radiologist's mean opinion score (MOS) with the source image, the model is guided to generate one reference images of each quality. Then, in the second stage, the reference images are fed into our proposed class attention siamese network (CASNet) based on class activation mapping (CAM) under few-shot learning to fully explore the information in limited reference images. It can enforce the model to focus on the key lesion area and effectively reduce the dependence of MIFQA on medical fused images. Finally, the quality score of the unlabeled fused image is predicted by calculating the distance with reference image. Experiments on home-made MIFQA dataset shows that our method can achieve results that are ahead of the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Image Aesthetic Quality Assessment (IAQA) aims to simulate user perceptions to judge the aesthetic quality of images. Due to the high subjectivity of users and the complexity of image aesthetics, modeling IAQA solely at the image level is a compromise. Consequently, existing methods mainly focus on multimodal-based models and achieve effective performance. These methods explore aesthetic comments on images to characterize users and serve as auxiliary text information for multimodal modeling. Unfortunately, this may suffer from two limitations. One limitation is that aesthetic comments are often unavailable for an unknown image in the test phase, and another limitation is that the semantic information of these comments may be uncertain and fuzzy. Therefore, this paper proposes a progressively generated text-assisted image aesthetic quality assessment method, aiming to address the lack of aesthetic comments and the fuzziness of aesthetic judgments in these comments. Specifically, we first adopt a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate aesthetic comments on images by simulating user perceptions and utilize the generated comments to characterize their aesthetic perception to assist in the pre-training of our multimodal-based IAQA model. Then, we design an attribute prediction module to determine the attribute levels of aesthetic judgments and utilize text template construction to further generate explicit descriptions of image aesthetics. Finally, we leverage the generated attribute descriptions to further assist in training our IAQA model. By progressively generating textual auxiliary descriptions of aesthetics for images, the proposed model can gradually determine the aesthetic quality of the images. Massive experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream methods on multiple IAQA datasets.",

      "abstract": "Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that are capable of capturing motion information with high temporal resolution, which show potential in aiding image motion deblurring recently. Most existing methods indiscriminately handle feature fusion of two modalities with symmetric unidirectional/bidirectional interactions at different-level layers in feature encoder, while ignoring the different dependencies between cross-modal hierarchical features. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Asymmetric Hierarchical Difference-aware Interaction Network (AHDINet) for event-based motion deblurring, which explores the complementarity of two modalities with differential dependence modeling of cross-modal hierarchical features. Thereby, an event-assisted edge complement module is designed to leverage event modality to enhance the edge details of the image features in low-level encoder stage, and an image-assisted semantic complement module is developed to transfer contextual semantics of image features to event branch in high-level encoder stage. Benefiting from the proposed differentiated interaction mode, the respective advantages of image and event modalities are fully exploited. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Compared with no-reference image quality assessment (IQA), full-reference IQA often achieves higher consistency with human subjective perception due to the reference information for comparison. A natural idea is to design strategies that allow the latter to guide the former’s learning to achieve better performance. However, how to construct the reference information and how to transfer prior knowledge are two important issues we are going to face that have not been fully explored. To this end, a novel method called no-reference IQA via inter-level adaptive knowledge distillation (AKD-IQA) is proposed. The core of AKD-IQA lies in transferring image distribution difference information from the full-reference teacher model to the no-reference student model through inter-level AKD. First, the teacher model is constructed based on multi-level feature discrepancy extractor and cross-scale feature integrator. Then, it is trained on a large synthetic distortion dataset to establish a comprehensive difference prior distribution. Finally, the image re-distortion strategy and inter-level AKD are introduced into the student model for effective learning. Experimental results on six standard IQA datasets demonstrate that the AKD-IQA achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of it in generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated excellent zero-shot capability across semantic recognition tasks, mainly attributed to the training on a large-scale I&1T (one Image with one Text) dataset. This kind of multimodal representations often blend semantic and perceptual elements, placing a particular emphasis on semantics. However, this could be problematic for popular tasks like image quality assessment (IQA) and conditional image generation (CIG), which typically need to have fine control on perceptual and semantic features. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a new multimodal disentangled representation learning framework, which leverages disentangled text to guide image disentanglement. To this end, we first build an I&2T (one Image with a perceptual Text and a semantic Text) dataset, which consists of disentangled perceptual and semantic text descriptions for an image. Then, the disentangled text descriptions are utilized as supervisory signals to disentangle pure perceptual representations from CLIP's original `coarse' feature space, dubbed DeCLIP. Finally, the decoupled feature representations are used for both image quality assessment (technical quality and aesthetic quality) and conditional image generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method on the two popular tasks. The dataset, code, and model will be available.",

      "abstract": "Image cropping aims to find visually pleasing content in an image, which will enhance its aesthetic quality. Existing image cropping approaches mainly emphasize the geometric properties of images, such as composition and layout, neglecting the rich aesthetic information available from the physical attributes (e.g., content and themes), and background information beyond the foreground in images. Consequently, this article proposes an image cropping method based on the content and composition attribute-aware global relation reasoning, which aims at guiding the generation of cropped sub-images by exploring critical attributes based on content and composition as well as global object correlations that affect aesthetics in images. Particularly, to comprehensively introduce aesthetic information into image cropping, we capture feature representations reinforced by content and composition attributes simultaneously. The feature representations can strengthen the visual aesthetics of cropped sub-images. To make the cropped sub-images amply contain more global information, we introduce a global relation reasoning branch in the proposed cropping module, which can fully exploit the dependency relationship between the foreground and background in images. Extensive experiments on image cropping benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art image cropping methods.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of single image super-resolution (SR) technology, there is an urgent need to develop a fair no reference Super-Resolution image Quality Assessment (SRQA) method. Existing no reference SRQA methods primarily concentrate on SR artifacts including structural distortion and texture distortion by extracting spatial features, but ignore the inductive bias of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based SR models. As a result, they function effectively for interpolation-based and dictionary-based algorithms, but struggle to perform as effectively with DNN-based SR algorithms. We found that the visual content generated by DNN-based SR models under different inductive biases often carries a content-invariant model-specific style, which can be captured by the correlations between hierarchical representation channels. To that end, we propose a novel Scene-modulated High-order Statistical Representation network (SmHSR) built on a multi-scale over-complete transformation. We quantify the perceptual quality of SR images as the shift of high-order statistical properties in their multi-scale over-complete representation, where intra-channel statistics are used to capture spatial correlations and inter-channel statistics are used to capture the inductive bias of SR models. In addition, the scene information implicit in the deep over-complete representation is used to modulate the high-order statistical properties, which simulates the top-down regulation of cognition on perception. Under the modulation of scene information, SmHSR can learn more sophisticated scene-aware statistical representation. The MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) is used to map the high-order statistical representation to an overall quality. We test our method on multiple SR image quality databases. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art SRQA methods.",

      "abstract": "Wide-angle video is favored for its wide viewing angle and ability to capture a large area of scenery, making it an ideal choice for sports and adventure recording. However, wide-angle video is prone to deformation, exposure and other distortions, resulting in poor video quality and affecting the perception and experience, which may seriously hinder its application in fields such as competitive sports. Up to now, few explorations focus on the quality assessment issue of wide-angle video. This deficiency primarily stems from the absence of a specialized dataset for wide-angle videos. To bridge this gap, we construct the first Multi-annotated and multi-modal Wide-angle Video quality assessment (MWV) dataset. Then, the performances of state-of-the-art video quality methods on the MWV dataset are investigated by inter-dataset testing and intra-dataset testing. Experimental results show that these methods impose significant limitations on their applicability.",

      "abstract": "Recently, AI-generated images (AIGIs), synthesized based on initial textual prompts, have attracted widespread attention. However, due to limitations in current generation techniques, these images often exhibit degraded perceptual quality and semantic misalignment with the guiding prompts. Therefore, evaluating both perceptual quality and text-to-image alignment is essential for optimizing the performance of generative models. Existing methods design textual prompts solely based on the initial prompt for both perceptual and alignment quality tasks, and compute only coarse-grained similarity between the designed prompt and the generated image. However, such task-agnostic prompts overlook the distinctions between the perceptual and alignment quality tasks, and coarse-level similarity fails to capture semantic details, leading to suboptimal evaluation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel AIGI quality assessment framework, termed TPMS, which incorporates task-specific prompt and multi-granularity similarity computation. The task-specific prompt constructs dedicated prompts for perceptual and alignment quality respectively, allowing the model to capture distinct quality cues tailored to each evaluation task. Multi-granularity similarity measures the coarse-level similarity between the generated image and task-specific prompts to capture global quality characteristics, and the fine-level similarity between the generated image and the initial prompt to enhance semantic detail awareness. By integrating these two complementary similarities, TPMS enables precise and robust quality prediction. Extensive experiments on four widely-used AIGI quality benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.",

      "abstract": "Existing free-energy guided No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods continue to face challenges in effectively restoring complexly distorted images. The features guiding the main network for quality assessment lack interpretability, and efficiently leveraging high-level feature information remains a significant challenge. As a novel class of state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative model, the diffusion model exhibits the capability to model intricate relationships, enhancing image restoration effectiveness. Moreover, the intermediate variables in the denoising iteration process exhibit clearer and more interpretable meanings for high-level visual information guidance. In view of these, we pioneer the exploration of the diffusion model into the domain of NR-IQA. We design a novel diffusion model for enhancing images with various types of distortions, resulting in higher quality and more interpretable high-level visual information. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion model establishes a clear mapping relationship between image reconstruction and image quality scores, which the network learns to guide quality assessment. Finally, to fully leverage high-level visual information, we design two complementary visual branches to collaboratively perform quality evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven public NR-IQA datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms SOTA methods for NR-IQA. The codes will be available at https://github.com/handsomewzy/DiffV2IQA.",

      "abstract": "Panoramic image quality assessment (PIQA) has been becoming a high-profile visual task with the public’s high attention to immersive media. Most existing PIQA metrics neglect the consumers’ viewing behavior of perceiving panoramic image quality along a scanpath in 360 degrees and the significance of both local and global feature representation, which hinders their further performance development. Inspired by these facts, we propose a no-reference PIQA metric based on scanpath prediction and bi-dimensional feature representation (SPP-BFR). The SPP module is achieved by the minimum entropy difference based fixation point estimation method proposed by us, which has the advantages of both simulating the viewing behavior and reducing the computation overhead. The bi-dimensional features are explored by a large kernel attention based local feature representation network and the self-attention mechanism based global feature representation network, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly released datasets show the superiority of the SPP-BFR metric to the state-of-the-arts.",

      "abstract": "The objective of blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is to develop a model capable of automatically evaluating image quality without requiring any reference knowledge. While multi-task learning has been widely utilized in BIQA, it has predominantly remained unimodal. This paper delves into the Visual-Language multi-task BIQA model, where distortion knowledge can be captured through image-text contrastive learning. Specifically, Visual-Language auxiliary tasks targeting distortion type and quality level are introduced, respectively, where both positive and negative image-text pairs are constructed for the target distorted image. Subsequently, image-text correspondences are learned in the embedding space while simultaneously evaluating image quality. Notably, in the auxiliary task learning, the proposed method not only brings the image and its corresponding positive text prompt closer but also pushes away the image from its negative text prompts, thereby facilitating the extraction of pertinent distortion features. In the quality assessment task, a patch-wise strategy is employed during the training phase. Differing from conventional BIQA methods, a novel NSS-guided quality weighting is introduced to gauge the correlation between patch quality and global quality, thereby enabling precise quality prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on six IQA datasets, and the experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Enhancing video quality assessment (VQA) through semantic information integration is a critical research focus. Recent research has employed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model as a foundation to improve semantic perception. However, the image-text alignment inherent in these pre-trained Vision-Language (VL) models frequently results in suboptimal VQA performance. While prompt engineering has recently targeted the language component to address this alignment issue, the unique insights resided in visual analysis is still overlooked for further advancing VQA tasks. Additionally, seeking a trade-off between quality separability and domain invariance in VQA remains largely unresolved within the VL paradigm. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-modal prompt-based approach to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we propose learnable prompts within the vision branch to foster synergy between visual and language modalities through a language-to-vision coupling function. The multi-view backbone is then carefully crafted with content enhancement and distortion-aware temporal modulation to ensure quality separability. The language prompts, derived from visual representations, are further supported by adaptive weighting mechanisms to optimize the balance between quality separability and domain invariance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over leading VQA models, showing significant improvements in generalization across diverse datasets.

      "abstract": "With the differential sensitivity and high time resolution, event cameras can record detailed motion clues, which form a complementary advantage with frame-based cameras to enhance the object tracking, especially in challenging dynamic scenes. However, how to better match heterogeneous event-image data and exploit rich complementary cues from them still remains an open issue. In this paper, we align event-image modalities by proposing a motion adaptive event sampling method, and we revisit the cross-complementarities of event-image data to design a bidirectional-enhanced fusion framework. Specifically, this sampling strategy can adapt to different dynamic scenes and integrate aligned event-image pairs. Besides, we design an image-guided motion estimation unit for extracting explicit instance-level motions, aiming at refining the uncertain event clues to distinguish primary objects and background. Then, a semantic modulation module is devised to utilize the enhanced object motion to modify the image features. Coupled with these two modules, this framework learns both the high motion sensitivity of events and the full texture of images to achieve more accurate and robust tracking. The proposed method is easily embedded in existing tracking pipelines, and trained end-to-end. We evaluate it on four large benchmarks, i.e. FE108, VisEvent, FE240hz and CoeSot. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, and large improvements are pointed as contributions by our sampling strategy and fusion concept.",

      "abstract": "In the Image Aesthetics Computing (IAC) field, most prior methods leveraged the off-the-shelf backbones pre-trained on the large-scale ImageNet database. While these pre-trained backbones have achieved notable success, they often overemphasize object-level semantics and fail to capture the high-level concepts of image aesthetics, which may only achieve suboptimal performances. To tackle this long-neglected problem, we propose a multi-modality multi-attribute contrastive pre-training framework, targeting at constructing an alternative to ImageNet-based pre-training for IAC. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of two main aspects. 1) We build a multi-attribute image description database with human feedback, leveraging the competent image understanding capability of the multi-modality large language model to generate rich aesthetic descriptions. 2) To better adapt models to aesthetic computing tasks, we integrate the image-based visual features with the attribute-based text features, and map the integrated features into different embedding spaces, based on which the multi-attribute contrastive learning is proposed for obtaining more comprehensive aesthetic representation. To alleviate the distribution shift encountered when transitioning from the general visual domain to the aesthetic domain, we further propose a semantic affinity loss to restrain the content information and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework sets new state-of-the-arts for IAC tasks.",

      "abstract": "The highly abstract nature of image aesthetics perception (IAP) poses a significant challenge for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The lack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this dilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception capabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a comprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT) dataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics foundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics perception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904 diverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are collected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic grades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle diverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and assemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT, which consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic capabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced general foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models, dubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert models deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

      "abstract": "Image Aesthetic Quality Assessment (IAQA) aims to simulate users' visual perception to judge the aesthetic quality of images. In social media, users' aesthetic experiences are often reflected in their textual comments regarding the aesthetic attributes of images. To fully explore the attribute information perceived by users for evaluating image aesthetic quality, this paper proposes an image aesthetic quality assessment method based on attribute-driven multimodal hierarchical prompts. Unlike existing IAQA methods that utilize multimodal pre-training or straightforward prompts for model learning, the proposed method leverages attribute comments and quality-level text templates to hierarchically learn the aesthetic attributes and quality of images. Specifically, we first leverage users' aesthetic attribute comments to perform prompt learning on images. The learned attribute-driven multimodal features can comprehensively capture the semantic information of image aesthetic attributes perceived by users. Then, we construct text templates for different aesthetic quality levels to further facilitate prompt learning through semantic information related to the aesthetic quality of images. The proposed method can explicitly simulate users' aesthetic judgment of images to obtain more precise aesthetic quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IAQA method based on hierarchical prompts outperforms existing methods significantly on multiple IAQA databases.

      "abstract": "The perception of image aesthetics is built upon the understanding of semantic content. However, how to evaluate the aesthetic quality of images with diversified semantic backgrounds remains challenging in image aesthetics assessment (IAA). To address the dilemma, this paper presents a semantics-aware image aesthetics assessment approach, which first analyzes the semantic content of images and then models the aesthetic distinctions among images from two perspectives, i.e., aesthetic attribute and aesthetic level. Concretely, we propose two strategies, dubbed tag matching and contrastive ranking, to extract knowledge pertaining to image aesthetics. The tag matching identifies the semantic category and the dominant aesthetic attributes based on predefined tag libraries. The contrastive ranking is designed to uncover the comparative relationships among images with different aesthetic levels but similar semantic backgrounds. In the process of contrastive ranking, the impact of long-tailed distribution of aesthetic data is also considered by balanced sampling and traversal contrastive learning. Extensive experiments and comparisons on three benchmark IAA databases demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in terms of both prediction accuracy and alleviating long-tailed effect.

However, the state-of-the-art IQA models are still subject to the generalization challenge when facing real-world problems. In this talk, the latest advances in generalizable image quality assessment will be reviewed, with focus on the distortion diversity and content/theme/scene variation dilemmas. Recent advances on multi-modal IQA will also be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Compared with the unimodal image aesthetics assessment (IAA), multimodal IAA has demonstrated superior performance. This indicates that the critiques could provide rich aesthetics-aware semantic information, which also enhance the explainability of IAA models. However, images are not always accompanied with critiques in real-world situation, rendering multimodal IAA inapplicable in most cases. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate whether we can generate aesthetic critiques to facilitate image aesthetic representation learning and enhance model explainability. Motivated by these facts, this paper presents an attribute-oriented Critiques Generation framework for explainable IAA, dubbed CG-IAA, which consists of three major components, i.e., Vision-Language Aesthetic Pretraining (VLAP), Multi-Attribute Experts Learning (MAEL) and Multimodal Aesthetics Prediction (MAP). Specifically, the vanilla CLIP is first finetuned on a multimodal IAA database. Considering that the aesthetic critiques typically consist of multiple attributes, a new multimodal IAA database which contains over 1 million critiques with up to four aesthetic attributes is constructed with the language model-based knowledge transfer. Then, CLIP-based multi-attribute experts are trained based on this database. Finally, the pretrained experts are utilized to generate aesthetic critiques for assisting unimodal image aesthetics prediction. Extensive experiments have been done on four popular IAA databases, and the results demonstrate the advantage of CG-IAA over the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, CG-IAA features better explainability and generalization with the assistance of generated critiques.

      "abstract": "Opinion-Unaware Blind Image Quality Assessment (OU-BIQA) models aim to predict image quality without training on reference images and subjective quality scores. Thereinto, image statistical comparison is a classic paradigm, while the performance is limited by the representation ability of visual descriptors. Deep features as visual descriptors have advanced IQA in recent research, but they are discovered to be highly texture-biased and lack shape-bias. On this basis, we find out that image shape and texture cues respond differently toward distortions, and the absence of either one results in an incomplete image representation. Therefore, to formulate a well-rounded statistical description for images, we utilize the shape-biased and texture-biased deep features produced by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) simultaneously. More specifically, we design a Shape-Texture Adaptive Fusion (STAF) module to merge shape and texture information, based on which we formulate quality-relevant image statistics. The perceptual quality is quantified by the variant Mahalanobis distance between the inner and outer Deep Shape-Texture Statistics (DSTS), wherein the inner and outer statistics respectively describe the quality fingerprints of the distorted image and natural images. The proposed DSTS delicately utilizes shape-texture statistical relations between different data scales in the deep domain and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality prediction performance on images with artificial and authentic distortions.",

      "abstract": "Recently, Vision Transformer has achieved great success in recovering missing details in low-resolution sequences, i.e., the video super-resolution (VSR) task. Despite its su-periority in VSR accuracy, the heavy computational bur-den as well as the large memory footprint hinder the de-ployment of Transformer-based VSR models on constrained devices. In this paper, we address the above issue by proposing a novel feature-level masked processing frame-work: VSR with Masked Intra and inter-frame Attention (MIA-VSR). The core of MIA-VSR is leveraging feature-level temporal continuity between adjacent frames to re-duce redundant computations and make more rational use of previously enhanced SR features. Concretely, we propose an intra-frame and inter-frame attention block which takes the respective roles of past features and input features into consideration and only exploits previously enhanced fea-tures to provide supplementary information. In addition, an adaptive block-wise mask prediction module is developed to skip unimportant computations according to feature sim-ilarity between adjacent frames. We conduct detailed ab-lation studies to validate our contributions and compare the proposed method with recent state-of-the-art VSR approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that MIA-VSR improves the memory and computation efficiency over state-of-the-art methods, without trading off PSNR accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/LabShuHangGU/MIA-VSR.",

      "abstract": "The annotation of blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially for authentic images. Training on synthetic data is expected to be beneficial, but synthetically trained models often suffer from poor generalization in real domains due to domain gaps. In this work, we make a key observation that introducing more distortion types in the synthetic dataset may not improve or even be harmful to generalizing authentic image quality assessment. To solve this challenge, we propose distortion-guided unsupervised domain adaptation for BIQA (DGQA), a novel framework that leverages adaptive multi-domain selection via prior knowledge from distortion to match the data distribution between the source domains and the target domain, thereby reducing negative transfer from the outlier source domains. Extensive experiments on two cross-domain settings (synthetic distortion to authentic distortion and synthetic distortion to algorithmic distortion) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed DGQA. Besides, DGQA is orthogonal to existing model-based BIQA methods, and can be used in combination with such models to improve performance with less training data.",

      "abstract": "Motion deblurring can be advanced by exploiting informative features from supplementary sensors such as event cameras, which can capture rich motion information asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Existing event-based motion deblurring methods neither consider the modality redundancy in spatial fusion nor temporal cooperation between events and frames. To tackle these limitations, a novel spatial-temporal collaboration network (STCNet) is proposed for event-based motion deblurring. Firstly, we propose a differential-modality based cross-modal calibration strategy to suppress redundancy for complementarity enhancement, and then bimodal spatial fusion is achieved with an elaborate cross-modal co-attention mechanism to weight the contributions of them for importance balance. Besides, we present a frame-event mutual spatio-temporal attention scheme to alleviate the errors of relying only on frames to compute cross-temporal similarities when the motion blur is significant, and then the spatio-temporal features from both frames and events are aggregated with the custom cross-temporal coordinate attention. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project website: https://github.com/wyang-vis/STCNet.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, vision oriented intelligent vehicle systems such as autonomous driving or transportation assistance can be optimized by enhancing the visual visibility of images acquired in bad weather conditions. The presence of haze in such visual scenes is a critical threat. Image dehazing aims to restore spatial details from hazy images. There have emerged a number of image dehazing algorithms, designed to increase the visibility of those hazy images. However, much less work has been focused on evaluating the visual quality of dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a Reduced-Reference dehazed image quality evaluation approach based on Partial Discrepancy (RRPD) and then extend it to a No-Reference quality assessment metric with Blind Perception (NRBP). Specifically, inspired by the hierarchical characteristics of the human perceiving dehazed images, we introduce three groups of features: luminance discrimination, color appearance, and overall naturalness. In the proposed RRPD, the combined distance between a set of sender and receiver features is adopted to quantify the perceptually dehazed image quality. By integrating global and local channels from dehazed images, the RRPD is converted to NRBP which does not rely on any information from the references. Extensive experiment results on both synthetic and real dehazed image quality databases demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed dehazed image quality evaluation methods can be effectively applied to tune parameters for image dehazing algorithms and have the potential to be deployed in real transportation systems.",

      "abstract": "With collective endeavors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are undergoing a flourishing development. However, their performances on image aesthetics perception remain indeterminate, which is highly desired in real-world applications. An obvious obstacle lies in the absence of a specific benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs on aesthetic perception. This blind groping may impede the further development of more advanced MLLMs with aesthetic perception capacity. To address this dilemma, we propose AesBench, an expert benchmark aiming to comprehensively evaluate the aesthetic perception capacities of MLLMs through elaborate design across dual facets. (1) We construct an Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD), which features diversified image contents and high-quality annotations provided by professional aesthetic experts. (2) We propose a set of integrative criteria to measure the aesthetic perception abilities of MLLMs from four perspectives, including Perception (AesP), Empathy (AesE), Assessment (AesA) and Interpretation (AesI). Extensive experimental results underscore that the current MLLMs only possess rudimentary aesthetic perception ability, and there is still a significant gap between MLLMs and humans. We hope this work can inspire the community to engage in deeper explorations on the aesthetic potentials of MLLMs. Source data will be available at https://github.com/yipoh/AesBench.",

      "abstract": "Motion deblurring is a highly ill-posed problem due to the significant loss of motion information in the blurring process. Complementary informative features from auxiliary sensors such as event cameras can be explored for guiding motion deblurring. The event camera can capture rich motion information asynchronously with microsecond accuracy. In this paper, a novel frame-event fusion framework is proposed for event-driven motion deblurring (FEF-Deblur), which can sufficiently explore long-range cross-modal information interactions. Firstly, different modalities are usually complementary and also redundant. Cross-modal fusion is modeled as complementary-unique features separation-and-aggregation, avoiding the modality redundancy. Unique features and complementary features are first inferred with parallel intra-modal self-attention and inter-modal cross-attention respectively. After that, a correlation-based constraint is designed to act between unique and complementary features to facilitate their differentiation, which assists in cross-modal redundancy suppression. Additionally, spatio-temporal dependencies among neighboring inputs are crucial for motion deblurring. A recurrent cross attention is introduced to preserve inter-input attention information, in which the current spatial features and aggregated temporal features are attending to each other by establishing the long-range interaction between them. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world motion deblurring datasets demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art event-based and image/video-based methods. The code will be made publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) is an interesting but challenging task, owing to the ineffable nature of human sense of beauty. The study of IAA has evolved from simple binary classification to more complex score regression and distribution prediction. It is effortless for people to perform aesthetic binary classification, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i> , aesthetically pleasing or not. However, further judgment on the fine-level scalar aesthetic score is complex and typically determined by aesthetic attributes presented in the image, such as content, lighting and color. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a Coarse-to-fine image Aesthetics assessment model guided by Dynamic Attribute Selection, dubbed CADAS. The underlying idea is to simulate the process of human aesthetic perception by performing coarse-to-fine aesthetic reasoning. Specifically, a hierarchical AttributeNet is first pre-trained by imitating the staged mechanism of human aesthetic experience, producing the candidate aesthetic attributes. Then, an AestheticNet is introduced to perform the coarse-level binary classification, based on which a confidence-based attribute selection strategy is designed to dynamically pick out the dominant aesthetic attributes from the candidate ones. Finally, a self-attention-based FusionNet is designed to explore the interaction between dominant aesthetic attributes and aesthetic features, producing the fine-level aesthetic prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, CADAS is also able to output the dominant aesthetic attributes in images, facilitating model explainability.",

However, existing approaches typically learn quality score regression directly in an end-to-end fashion, which leaves networks susceptible to interference from task-agnostic information, and fails to capture the continuity of BIQA. In this work, by explicitly establishing inter-sample associations, a simple yet effective BIQA framework based on perceptual comparison is proposed to capture the continuity. To this end, besides the basic quality score regression, the relative quality scores between images are predicted to exploit the relative quality relationships between samples for optimizing the representation of image perceptual quality. In addition, based on the human perceptual characteristic, we derive a novel sample weighting strategy to dynamically adjust the weights for different samples in the network learning process for further improving the robustness of the model. The performances on both single-database and cross-database experiments achieve state-of-the-art, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Besides, the proposed framework is model-agnostic, which can effectively improve the performance of the benchmark model with no extra inference cost.",

      "abstract": "Image Quality Assessment (IQA) plays an important role in the field of computer vision. However, most of the existing metrics for Blind IQA (BIQA) adopt an end-to-end way and do not adequately simulate the process of human subjective evaluation, which limits further improvements in model performance. In the process of perception, people first give a preliminary impression of the distortion type and relative quality of the images, and then give a specific quality score under the influence of the interaction of the two. Although some methods have attempted to explore the effects of distortion type and relative quality, the relationship between them has been neglected. In this paper, we propose a BIQA with coarse-grained perception construction and fine-grained interaction learning, called PINet for short. The fundamental idea is to learn from the two-stage human perceptual process. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, the backbone initially processes a pair of synthetic distorted images with pseudo-subjective scores, and the multi-scale feature extraction module integrates the deep information and delivers it to the coarse-grained perception construction module, which performs the distortion discrimination and the quality ranking. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose a fine-grained interactive learning module to interact with the two pieces of information to further improve the performance of the proposed PINet. The experimental results prove that the proposed PINet not only achieves competing performances on synthetic distortion datasets but also performs better on authentic distortion datasets.",

      "abstract": "The quality of videos is the primary concern of video service providers. Built upon deep neural networks, video quality assessment (VQA) has rapidly progressed. Although existing works have introduced the knowledge of the human visual system (HVS) into VQA, there are still some limitations that hinder the full exploitation of HVS, including incomplete modeling with few HVS characteristics and insufficient connection among these characteristics. In this article, we present a novel spatial-temporal VQA method termed HVS-5M, wherein we design five modules to simulate five characteristics of HVS and create a bioinspired connection among these modules in a cooperative manner. Specifically, on the side of the spatial domain, the visual saliency module first extracts a saliency map. Then, the content-dependency and the edge masking modules extract the content and edge features, respectively, which are both weighted by the saliency map to highlight those regions that human beings may be interested in. On the other side of the temporal domain, the motion perception module extracts the dynamic temporal features. Besides, the temporal hysteresis module simulates the memory mechanism of human beings and comprehensively evaluates the video quality according to the fusion features from the spatial and temporal domains. Extensive experiments show that our HVS-5M outperforms the state-of-the-art VQA methods. Ablation studies are further conducted to verify the effectiveness of each module toward the proposed method.

      "abstract": "Omnidirectional image quality assessment (OIQA) has become a research hotspot in the field of image processing. The existing OIQA metrics have the common problem of incomplete perceptual information representation, which results in performance limitation. To deal with this problem, a perceptual information completion-based Siamese (PICS) OIQA network is proposed. Specifically, the input OI is first reprojected to generate another OI with complementary perceptual information. Both the original input OI and the generated OI are simultaneously fed into the following QA network, forming the Siamese network structure. For each branch of the QA network, the multiresolution local features and the complementary global features are severally extracted by convolution operations and self-attention modules and then are hierarchically aggregated to more fully simulate the visual perception mechanism. Finally, the aggregated features of the output of two branches are further fused to measure the quality of the OI to be tested. Through extensive experiments on two public OIQA datasets and deep analysis of the experimental results, the performance advancement of the PICS method is demonstrated in the OIQA task.",

      "abstract": "Despite the considerable effort devoted to high-generalizable blind image quality assessment (BIQA), the generalization performance of the state-of-the-art metrics remains limited when facing new visual scenes. A straightforward way to address the dilemma is labeling a great number of images from the new scene and subsequently training a new model, which is quite labor-intensive and cost-expensive. Hence, there is an urgent need to mitigate the dependency on labeled samples by designing a data-efficient BIQA algorithm. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents an Active Learning-based IQA (AL-IQA) framework, which reduces the requirement for training samples by selecting representative images from two perspectives, including distortion and content. Specifically, in terms of distortion, we design distortion prompts and adopt Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to predict image distortion in a zero-shot manner. Then, we employ curriculum learning-inspired strategy to select samples with gradually increasing difficulty (measured by prediction uncertainty of CLIP), in order to facilitate model training. Meantime, in terms of content, we adopt distribution matching-based dataset distillation to distill unlabeled images into several high-density informative synthetic images. Then, feature distances between unlabeled images and distilled images are compared to identify images with the most representative content. Finally, Borda count is adopted to capture a consensus of both distortion and content through weighted counting, and prompt tuning is utilized for adapting the model to the IQA task. Extensive experiments are conducted on five IQA datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed AL-IQA not only effectively reduces the number of training samples but also achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy and generalization performance.

      "abstract": "Image aesthetic assessment (IAA) has drawn wide attention in recent years as more and more users post images and texts on the Internet to share their views. The intense subjectivity and complexity of IAA make it extremely challenging. Text triggers the subjective expression of human aesthetic experience based on human implicit memory, so incorporating the textual information and identifying the relationship with the image is of great importance for IAA. However, IAA with the image as input fails to fully consider subjectivity, while existing multimodal IAA ignores the interrelationship among modalities. To this end, we propose a brain-inspired multimodal interaction network (BMI-Net) that simulates how the association area of the cerebral cortex processes sensory stimuli. In particular, the knowledge integration LSTM (KI-LSTM) is proposed to learn the image-text interaction relation. The proposed scalable multimodal fusion (SMF) based on low-rank decomposition fuses image, text and interaction modalities to predict the aesthetic distribution. Extensive experiments show that the proposed BMI-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three IAA tasks.",

      "abstract": "Event camera responds to the brightness changes at each pixel independently with microsecond accuracy. Event cameras offer attractive property that can record well high-speed scene but ignore static and non-moving areas, while conventional frame cameras are able to acquire the whole intensity information of the scene but suffer from motion blur. Therefore, it would be desirable to combine the best of two cameras for reconstructing high quality intensity frame with no motion blur. The human visual system presents a two-pathway procedure for non-action-based representation and objects motion perception, which corresponds well to the hybrid frame and event. In this paper, inspired by the two-pathway visual system, a novel dual-stream based framework is proposed for motion deblurring (DS-Deblur), which flexibly utilizes the respective advantages from frame and event. A complementary-unique information splitting based feature fusion module is firstly proposed to adaptively aggregate the frame and event progressively at multiple levels, which is well-grounded on the hierarchical process in twopathway visual system. Then, a recurrent spatio-temporal feature transformation module is designed to exploit relevant information between adjacent frames, in which features of both current and previous frames are transformed in a global-local manner. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real motion blur datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      "abstract": "Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) aims at predicting the aesthetic quality of images. Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models, like CLIP, have shown impressive performances on various visual tasks. When it comes to IAA, a straightforward way is to finetune the CLIP image encoder using aesthetic images. However, this can only achieve limited success without considering the uniqueness of multimodal data in the aesthetics domain. People usually assess image aesthetics according to fine-grained visual attributes, e.g., color, light and composition. However, how to learn aesthetics-aware attributes from CLIP-based semantic space has not been addressed before. With this motivation, this paper presents a CLIP-based multi-attribute contrastive learning framework for IAA, dubbed AesCLIP. Specifically, AesCLIP consists of two major components, i.e., aesthetic attribute-based comment classification and attribute-aware learning. The former classifies the aesthetic comments into different attribute categories. Then the latter learns an aesthetic attribute-aware representation by contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the domain shift from the general visual domain to the aesthetics domain. Extensive experiments have been done by using the pre-trained AesCLIP on four popular IAA databases, and the results demonstrate the advantage of AesCLIP over the state-of-the-arts. The source code will be public at https://github.com/OPPOMKLab/AesCLIP.",

      "abstract": "Personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA) has gained increasing attention from researchers due to its ability to measure individual users' specific aesthetic experiences. However, most existing PIAA methods rely on holistic features or simplistic coding to characterize users' aesthetic preferences for images, and we believe that more rich explicit features are needed in modeling PIAA. Consequently, we propose an attribute-guided fine-grained feature-aware personalized image aesthetics assessment method, which can fully capture fine-grained features from multiple attributes to represent users' aesthetic preferences for images. To achieve this, we first build a fine-grained feature extraction (FFE) module to obtain the refined local features of image attributes to compensate for holistic features. The FFE module is then used to generate user-level features, which are combined with the image-level features to obtain user-preferred fine-grained feature representations. By training extensive users' PIAA tasks, the aesthetic distribution of most users can be transferred to the personalized scores of individual users. To enable our proposed model to learn more generalizable aesthetics among individual users, we incorporate the degree of dispersion between users' personalized scores and image aesthetic distribution as a coefficient in the loss function during model training. Experimental results on several PIAA databases show that our method outperforms existing mainstream PIAA methods, and can effectively infer users' personalized aesthetics of images.",

      "abstract": "Endoscopic images captured under low-light enclosed intestinal environment usually have poor visibility (manifested as uneven illumination and noise), affecting the work efficiency of physicians and the accuracy of lesion detection. To improve the image quality, the literature has reported many low-light image enhancement (LIE) methods. However, most methods do not perform well in handling the low-light endoscopic image enhancement (LEIE) task, usually bringing additional artifacts or amplifying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel deep pyramid enhancement network (DPENet) to enhance endoscopic images from both global and local perspectives. Specifically, considering the uneven illumination of endoscopic images, DPENet utilizes an image pyramid framework with three parallel branches to explore and integrate both global and local features at different scales. To suppress noise, DPENet sets multiple scale-space feature extraction blocks (SFEBs) in each branch. SFEB consists of a contextual feature extraction module (CFEM) and a spatial residual attention module (SRAM). CFEM mines contextual information to help the network understand semantic information while suppress the isolated noise. SRAM leverages the spatial attention mechanism to help the network adaptively focus on dim regions. Experimental results on a public dataset and our collected dataset show that DPENet is competent for the LEIE task with promising results, and outperforms 9 state-of-the-art LIE methods in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.",

By contrast, this task is much more challenging and arduous than traditional IQA task due to the high resolution of stitched panoramic images and the particularity and complexity of stitching distortions. For this task, we propose an effective method based on patch registration and bidimensional feature aggregation (PRBFA). First, inspired by the attention mechanism of the human visual system and the limited range of human vision, a soft patch segmentation and selection method is presented to determine the key patches in panoramic images to participate in the following patch matching and feature alignment stages, achieving patch registration between the panoramic image and the corresponding constituent images. Further, to fully simulate the human visual perception process from local viewport to panorama, the feature exploration is successively performed from local to global, which is also adaptive to the complexity of the distortions in stitched panoramic images. For performance testification, extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly released SPIQA database, the results of which prove the performance superiority of the PRBFA method.",

      "abstract": "With the assistance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models have made great progress in evaluating both simulated distortion and authentic distortion. However, most of the existing IQA models only learn the features of distorted images, and thus do not make full use of the available feature representation of other domains. Furthermore, the common multi-scale fusion strategies are relatively simple, such as downsampling and concatenating, which further limits the prediction performance. To this end, we propose a novel blind image quality index with cross-domain interaction and cross-scale integration, which is designed based on the combination of CNN and Transformer. First, the hierarchical spatial-domain and gradient-domain representations are obtained through a typical CNN architecture. Then, based on the proposed gradient-query cross-attention, these two types of features are fully interacted in the Cross-Domain Interaction (CDI) module. To represent the distortion information more comprehensively, the Cross-Scale Integration (CSI) module is proposed to combine the information between different scales progressively. Finally, the quality score is obtained through a simple regression module. The experimental results on five public IQA databases of both simulated and authentic scenes show that the proposed model outperforms the compared state-of-the-art metrics. In addition, cross-database experiments show that the proposed model has strong generalization performance.",

      "abstract": "In multidimensional signal processing, such as image and video processing, superresolution (SR) imaging is a classical problem. Over the past 25 years, academia and industry have been interested in reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. We review the development of SR technology in this tutorial article based on the evolution of key insights associated with the prior knowledge or regularization method from analytical representations to data-driven deep models. The coevolution of SR with other technical fields, such as autoregressive modeling, sparse coding, and deep learning, will be highlighted in both model-based and learning-based approaches. Model-based SR includes geometry-driven, sparsity-based, and gradient-profile priors; learning-based SR covers three types of neural network (NN) architectures, namely residual networks (ResNet), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and pretrained models (PTMs). Both model-based and learning-based SR are united by highlighting their limitations from the perspective of model-data mismatch. Our new perspective allows us to maintain a healthy skepticism about current practice and advocate for a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of model-based and learning-based SR. We will also discuss several open challenges, including arbitrary-ratio, reference-based, and domain-specific SR.",

      "abstract": "Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) is challenging due to its highly abstract nature. Nowadays, people tend to share images and comment them on social networks, which can provide rich information for judging image aesthetics. As a result, user comments of an image can be jointly utilized to learn better feature representations for IAA. Previous researches have shown that aesthetic attributes are crucial factors in determining image aesthetic quality and influencing people's aesthetic perception. Accordingly, when commenting an image, people usually give descriptions from the perspective of aesthetic attributes. Inspired by this, this paper presents a new Attribute-Assisted Multimodal network (AAM-Net) for image aesthetics assessment. Specifically, we propose a cross-modal attribute interaction module to explore the related aesthetic attribute semantics shared by an image and the corresponding aesthetic comments. Then, a cross-modal gate unit is introduced to further refine significant attribute semantics interactively. Finally, informative aesthetic features can be obtained for predicting image aesthetic distributions. Experimental results on two public multimodal IAA databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.",

People have different standards for image aesthetics, and accordingly, images rated at the same aesthetic level by different users explicitly reveal their aesthetic preferences. However, previous PIAA models treat each individual as an isolated optimization target, failing to take full advantage of the contrastive information among users. Further, although people's aesthetic preferences are unique, they still share some commonalities, meaning that PIAA models could be built on the basis of generic aesthetics. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a Multi-level Transitional Contrast Learning (MTCL) framework for PIAA by transiting features from generic aesthetics to personalized aesthetics via contrastive learning. First, a generic image aesthetics assessment network is pre-trained to learn the common aesthetic features. Then, image sets rated to have the same aesthetic levels by different users are employed to learn the differentiated aesthetic features through multiple level-wise contrast learning based on the generic aesthetic features. Finally, a target user's PIAA model is built by integrating generic and differentiated aesthetic features. Extensive experiments on four benchmark PIAA databases demonstrate that the proposed MTCL model outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",

      "abstract": "Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) has attracted growing interest in recent years but is still challenging due to its highly abstract nature. Nowadays, more and more people tend to comment images shared on the social networks, which can provide rich aesthetics-aware semantic information from different aspects. Therefore, user comments of an image can be exploited as supplementary information for enhancing aesthetic representation learning. Previous researches have demonstrated that aesthetic attributes make significant effect on image aesthetic quality and humans' aesthetic perception. Typically, people are used to give comments on an image from the perspective of aesthetic attributes, based on which the aesthetic quality of images can be inferred. Motivated by this, this paper presents an Attribute-assisted Multimodal Memory Network (AMM-Net) for image aesthetics assessment, which utilizes aesthetic attributes to model the interactions between visual and textual modalities. Specifically, we design two memory networks to capture the attribute-aware information most related to the image and associated comments respectively. Further, with multiple memory hops, attribute semantics shared by the two modalities are refined and cross-modal interactions are enhanced progressively. Finally, more discriminative aesthetic representations can be obtained for IAA. The experimental results and comparisons on two public multimodal IAA datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.

      "abstract": "People usually assess image aesthetics according to visual attributes, e.g., interesting content, good lighting and vivid color, etc. Further, the perception of visual attributes depends on the image theme. Therefore, the inherent relationship between visual attributes and image theme is crucial for image aesthetics assessment (IAA), which has not been comprehensively investigated. With this motivation, this paper presents a new IAA model based on Theme-Aware Visual Attribute Reasoning (TAVAR). The underlying idea is to simulate the process of human perception in image aesthetics by performing bilevel reasoning. Specifically, a visual attribute analysis network and a theme understanding network are first pre-trained to extract aesthetic attribute features and theme features, respectively. Then, the first level Attribute-Theme Graph (ATG) is built to investigate the coupling relationship between visual attributes and image theme. Further, a flexible aesthetics network is introduced to extract general aesthetic features, based on which we built the second level Attribute-Aesthetics Graph (AAG) to mine the relationship between theme-aware visual attributes and aesthetic features, producing the final aesthetic prediction. Extensive experiments on four public IAA databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TAVAR model over the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, TAVAR features better explainability due to the use of visual attributes.",

      "abstract": "Medical images are used as an important basis for diagnosing diseases, among which CT images are seen as an important tool for diagnosing lung lesions. However, manual segmentation of infected areas in CT images is time-consuming and laborious. With its excellent feature extraction capabilities, a deep learning-based method has been widely used for automatic lesion segmentation of COVID-19 CT images. However, the segmentation accuracy of these methods is still limited. To effectively quantify the severity of lung infections, we propose a Sobel operator combined with multi-attention networks for COVID-19 lesion segmentation (SMA-Net). In our SMA-Net method, an edge feature fusion module uses the Sobel operator to add edge detail information to the input image. To guide the network to focus on key regions, SMA-Net introduces a self-attentive channel attention mechanism and a spatial linear attention mechanism. In addition, the Tversky loss function is adopted for the segmentation network for small lesions. Comparative experiments on COVID-19 public datasets show that the average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and joint intersection over union (IOU) of the proposed SMA-Net model are 86.1% and 77.8%, respectively, which are better than those in most existing segmentation networks.",

      "abstract": "Both network pruning and neural architecture search (NAS) can be interpreted as techniques to automate the design and optimization of artificial neural networks. In this paper, we challenge the conventional wisdom of training before pruning by proposing a joint search-and-training approach to learn a compact network directly from scratch. Using pruning as a search strategy, we advocate three new insights for network engineering: 1) to formulate adaptive search as a cold start strategy to find a compact subnetwork on the coarse scale; and 2) to automatically learn the threshold for network pruning; 3) to offer flexibility to choose between efficiency and robustness. More specifically, we propose an adaptive search algorithm in the cold start by exploiting the randomness and flexibility of filter pruning. The weights associated with the network filters will be updated by ThreshNet, a flexible coarse-to-fine pruning method inspired by reinforcement learning. In addition, we introduce a robust pruning strategy leveraging the technique of knowledge distillation through a teacher-student network. Extensive experiments on ResNet and VGGNet have shown that our proposed method can achieve a better balance in terms of efficiency and accuracy and notable advantages over current state-of-the-art pruning methods in several popular datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

However, the design of learning-based algorithms for computational imaging often lacks transparency, making it difficult to optimize the entire imaging system in a complete manner.",

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) for in-the-wild images has achieved great progress by training advanced deep neural networks. However, the current BIQA models are suffering the generalization challenge, meaning that a well-trained BIQA model is still very limited in evaluating images with different distributions. Deep BIQA models are data-intensive, but the annotation of image quality labels is extremely expensive. To design a generalizable BIQA model with few training samples is highly desired. Motivated by the above fact, this paper presents a knowledge-guided BIQA (KG-IQA) framework by integrating domain knowledge from the human visual system (HVS) and natural scene statistics (NSS). Specifically, the quality-aware HVS and NSS features are first extracted as prior knowledge. Then, we embed the two types of knowledge into the conventional deep neural network by learning to predict the HVS and NSS features, producing the knowledge-enhanced quality features, based on which the final image quality score is obtained. We conduct extensive experiments and comparisons on five authentically distorted IQA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of knowledge greatly reduces the requirement on the amount of training images, and the proposed KG-IQA model achieves superior performance in terms of both prediction accuracy and generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) measures the perceived beauty of images using a computational approach. People usually assess the aesthetics of an image according to semantic attributes, e.g., lighting, color, object emphasis, etc. However, the state-of-the-art IAA approaches usually follow the data-driven framework without considering the rich attributes contained in images. With this motivation, this paper presents a new semantic attribute guided IAA model, where the attention maps of semantic attributes are employed to enhance the representation ability of general aesthetic features for more effective aesthetics assessment. Specifically, we first design an attribute attention generation network to obtain the attention maps for different semantic attributes, which are utilized to weight the general aesthetic features, producing the semantic attribute-enhanced feature representations. Then, the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is employed to further investigate the inherent relationship among the enhanced aesthetic features, producing the final image aesthetics prediction. Extensive experiments and comparisons on three public IAA databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) that can directly evaluate image quality without perfect-quality reference has been a long-standing research topic. Although the existing BIQA models have achieved very encouraging performance, the lack of explainability and generalization ability limits their real-world applications to a great extent. People usually assess image quality according to semantic attributes, e.g., brightness, color, contrast, noise and sharpness. Furthermore, judgment on image quality is also impacted by the scene presented in the image. Therefore, the inherent relationship between semantic attributes and scenes is crucial for image quality assessment, which has rarely been explored yet. With this motivation, this paper presents a Semantic Attribute Reasoning based image QUality Evaluator (SARQUE). Specifically, we propose a two-stream network to predict semantic attributes and scene categories from distorted images. To investigate the inherent relationship between the semantic attributes and scene category, a semantic reasoning module is further proposed based on the graph convolution network (GCN), producing the final quality score. Extensive experiments conducted on five in-the-wild image quality databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SARQUE model over the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, the proposed model features better explainability and generalization ability due to the use of semantic attributes.",

      "abstract": "Despite the impressive progress of supervised methods in quality assessment for in- the-wild videos, models trained on one domain often fail to generalize well to others due to the domain shifts caused by distortion diversity and content variation. Domain generalizable video quality assessment (VQA) methods that can work across domains remain an open research challenge. Although combining more data following the mixed-domain training strategy can improve the generalization performance to a certain extent, the specific knowledge from each source domain, which could potentially be useful for improving unseen domain generalization, is ignored in this principle. Motivated by this, we propose a domain generalizable VQA method named Dynamic Ensemble of Expert-Knowledge (DEEK), a novel framework that dynamically exploits the expert-knowledge from each source domain to achieve a generalizable ensemble prediction. Specifically, based on the multiple experts each trained to specialize in a particular source domain, we aim to exploit complementary information provided by the expert-knowledge. We effectively train an ensemble model by proposing a quality-sensitive InfoNCE loss to regularize the collaborative training of all experts in the contrastive learning formulation, aiming to exploit complementary information provided by the expert-knowledge when forming the ensemble. By dynamically integrating the experts according to their relevances to the target data, these expert-knowledge could be leveraged for better generalization. Experiments on five VQA datasets verify that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts by large margins.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, people are accustomed to posting images and associated text for expressing their emotions on social networks. Accordingly, multimodal sentiment analysis has drawn increasingly more attention. Most of the existing image-text multimodal sentiment analysis methods simply predict the sentiment polarity. However, the same sentiment polarity may correspond to quite different emotions, such as happiness vs. excitement and disgust vs. sadness. Therefore, sentiment polarity is ambiguous and may not convey the accurate emotions that people want to express. Psychological research has shown that objects and words are emotional stimuli and that semantic concepts can affect the role of stimuli. Inspired by this observation, this paper presents a new MUlti-Level SEmantic Reasoning network (MULSER) for fine-grained image-text multimodal emotion classification, which not only investigates the semantic relationship among objects and words respectively, but also explores the semantic relationship between regional objects and global concepts. For image modality, we first build graphs to extract objects and global representation, and employ a graph attention module to perform bilevel semantic reasoning. Then, a joint visual graph is built to learn the regional-global semantic relations. For text modality, we build a word graph and further apply graph attention to reinforce the interdependencies among words in a sentence. Finally, a cross-modal attention fusion module is proposed to fuse semantic-enhanced visual and textual features, based on which informative multimodal representations are obtained for fine-grained emotion classification. The experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Transformer based on self-attention mechanism is blooming in computer vision nowadays. However, its application to video quality assessment (VQA) has not been reported. Evaluating the quality of in-the-wild videos is challenging due to the unknown of pristine reference and shooting distortion. This paper presents a novel space-time attention network for the VQA problem, named StarVQA. StarVQA builds a Transformer by alternately concatenating the divided space-time attention. To adapt the Transformer architecture for training, StarVQA designs a vectorized regression loss by encoding the mean opinion score (MOS) to the probability vector and embedding a special vectorized label token as the learnable variable. To capture the long-range spatiotemporal dependencies of a video sequence, StarVQA encodes the space-time position information of each patch to the input of the Transformer. Various experiments are conducted on the de-facto in-the-wild video datasets, including LIVE-VQC, KoNViD-1k, LSVQ, and LSVQ-1080p. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of StarVQA over the state-of-the-art. The source code is available at https://github.com/GZHU-DVL/StarVQA.",

Therefore, it would be desirable to combine the best of two cameras for reconstructing high quality intensity frame with no motion blur. The human visual system presents a two-pathway procedure for non-action-based representation and objects motion perception, which corresponds well to the hybrid frame and event. In this paper, inspired by the two-pathway visual system, a novel dual-stream based framework is proposed for motion deblurring (DS-Deblur), which flexibly utilizes the respective advantages from frame and event. A complementary-unique information splitting based feature fusion module is firstly proposed to adaptively aggregate the frame and event progressively at multiple levels, which is well-grounded on the hierarchical process in twopathway visual system. Then, a recurrent spatio-temporal feature transformation module is designed to exploit relevant information between adjacent frames, in which features of both current and previous frames are transformed in a global-local manner. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real motion blur datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      "abstract": "Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a compelling neuromorphic camera compared to conventional camera, but it suffers from fiercer noise. Due to the nature of irregular format and asynchronous readout, DVS data is always transformed into a regular tensor (e.g., 3D voxel or image) for deep learning method, which corrupts its own asynchronous properties. To maintain asynchronous, we establish an innovative asynchronous event denoise neural network, named AEDNet, which directly consumes the correlation of the irregular signal in spatial-temporal range without destroying its original structural property. Based on the property of continuation in temporal domain and discreteness in spatial domain, we decompose the DVS signal into two parts, i.e., temporal correlation and spatial affinity, and separately process these two parts. Our spatial feature embedding unit is a unique feature extraction module that extracts feature from event-level, which perfectly maintains its spatial-temporal correlation. To test effectiveness, we build a novel dataset named DVSCLEAN containing both simulated and real-world data. The experimental results of AEDNet achieve SOTA.",

      "abstract": "Personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA) aims at capturing individual aesthetic preference. Fine-tuning on personalized data has been proven to be effective in PIAA task. However, a fixed fine-tuning strategy may cause under/over-fitting on limited personal data and it also brings additional training cost. To alleviate these issues, we employ a meta learning-based Transductive Aesthetic Preference Propagation (TAPP-PIAA) algorithm under regression manner to substitute the fine-tuning strategy. Specifically, each user's data is regarded as a meta-task and spilt into support and query set. Then, we extract deep aesthetic features with a pre-trained generic image aesthetic assessment (GIAA) model. Next, we treat image features as graph nodes and their similarities as edge weights to construct an undirected nearest neighbor graph for inference. Instead of fine-tuning on support set, TAPP-PIAA propagates aesthetic preference from support to query set with a predefined propagation formula. Finally, to learn a generalizable aesthetic representation for various users, we optimize our TAPP-PIAA across different users with meta-learning framework. Experimental results indicate that our TAPP-PIAA can surpass the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark databases.",

      "abstract": "Video quality is a primary concern for video service providers. In recent years, the techniques of video quality assessment (VQA) based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed rapidly. Although existing works attempt to introduce the knowledge of the human visual system (HVS) into VQA, there still exhibit limitations that prevent the full exploitation of HVS, including an incomplete model by few characteristics and insufficient connections among these characteristics. To overcome these limitations, this paper revisits HVS with five representative characteristics, and further reorganizes their connections. Based on the revisited HVS, a no-reference VQA framework called HVS-5M (NRVQA framework with five modules simulating HVS with five characteristics) is proposed. It works in a domain-fusion design paradigm with advanced network structures. On the side of the spatial domain, the visual saliency module applies SAMNet to obtain a saliency map. And then, the content-dependency and the edge masking modules respectively utilize ConvNeXt to extract the spatial features, which have been attentively weighted by the saliency map for the purpose of highlighting those regions that human beings may be interested in. On the other side of the temporal domain, to supplement the static spatial features, the motion perception module utilizes SlowFast to obtain the dynamic temporal features. Besides, the temporal hysteresis module applies TempHyst to simulate the memory mechanism of human beings, and comprehensively evaluates the quality score according to the fusion features from the spatial and temporal domains. Extensive experiments show that our HVS-5M outperforms the state-of-the-art VQA methods. Ablation studies are further conducted to verify the effectiveness of each module towards the proposed framework.",

      "abstract": "Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have provided a favoured prospect for authentically distorted image quality assessment (IQA). For good performance, most existing CNN-based methods rely on a large amount of labeled data for training, which is time-consuming and cumbersome to collect. By simultaneously exploiting few labeled data and many unlabeled data, we make a pioneering attempt to propose a semi-supervised framework (termed SSLIQA) with consistency-preserving dual-branch CNN for authentically distorted IQA in this paper. The proposed SSLIQA introduces a consistency-preserving strategy and transfers two kinds of consistency knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch. Concretely, SSLIQA utilizes the sample prediction consistency to train the student to mimic output activations of individual examples represented by the teacher. Considering that subjects often refer to previous analogous cases to make scoring decisions, SSLIQA computes the semantic relation among different samples in a batch and encourages the consistency of sample semantic relation between two branches to explore extra quality-related information. Benefiting from the consistency-preserving strategy, we can exploit numerous unlabeled data to improve network's effectiveness and generalization. Experimental results on three authentically distorted IQA databases show that the proposed SSLIQA is stably effective under different student-teacher combinations and different labeled-to-unlabeled data ratios. In addition, it points out a new way on how to achieve higher performance with a smaller network.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of short-video applications imposes more requirements for video quality assessment (VQA). User-generated content (UGC) videos are captured under an unprofessional environment, thus suffering from various dynamic degradations, such as camera shaking. To cover the dynamic degradations, existing recurrent neural network-based UGC-VQA methods can only provide implicit modeling, which is unclear and difficult to analyze. In this work, we consider explicit motion representation for dynamic degradations, and propose a motion-enhanced UGC-VQA method based on decomposition and recomposition. In the decomposition stage, a dual-stream decomposition module is built, and VQA task is decomposed into single frame-based quality assessment problem and cross frames-based motion understanding. The dual streams are well grounded on the two-pathway visual system during perception, and require no extra UGC data due to knowledge transfer. Hierarchical features from shallow to deep layers are gathered to narrow the gaps from tasks and domains. In the recomposition stage, a progressively residual aggregation module is built to recompose features from the dual streams. Representations with different layers and pathways are interacted and aggregated in a progressive and residual manner, which keeps a good trade-off between representation deficiency and redundancy. Extensive experiments on UGC-VQA databases verify that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and keeps a good capability of generalization.

      "abstract": "Perceptual quality assessment of 3D synthesized views is an open research problem in computer vision. Researchers across the globe have developed several algorithms to identify distortions. At the same time, the existing algorithms cannot quantify the context in which these distortions affect the overall perceptual quality. According to the recently proposed 3D view synthesis algorithm, the choice of context region for the disocclusion plays a vital role in predicting the quality of 3D views. The context region taken from the background of a view produces a perceptually better quality of 3D synthesized views than when the context region is taken from the foreground. With this view, the proposed algorithm aims to identify the context region and incorporate this information for the perceptual quality assessment of 3D synthesized views. We observed that the depth energy maps of the 3D synthesized views vary significantly with the change in the context region and subsequently can identify the context region. Hence, in this work, we propose a new and efficient quality assessment algorithm based upon the variation in the depth of 3D synthesized and reference views, giving two-fold advantages: 1. It can predict the quality based on whether the context region is foreground or not. 2. It is also able to suggest the possible location of distortions. We have proposed two new algorithms for both situations when the context region is foreground or not. The overall predicted score is the direct multiplication of the quality score estimated when the context region is foreground or not. When applied to the established benchmark dataset, the proposed technique performs satisfactorily with the PLCC of 0.7707 and 0.7572 of SRCC. Also, the proposed algorithm can work as a plug-in to improve the performance of the existing algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The neuromorphic event cameras can efficiently sense the latent geometric structures and motion clues of a scene by generating asynchronous and sparse event signals. Due to the irregular layout of the event signals, how to leverage their plentiful spatio-temporal information for recognition tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing methods tend to treat events as dense image-like or point-serie representations. However, they either suffer from severe destruction on the sparsity of event data or fail to encode robust spatial cues. To fully exploit their inherent sparsity with reconciling the spatio-temporal information, we introduce a compact event representation, namely 2D-1T event cloud sequence (2D-1T ECS). We couple this representation with a novel light-weight spatio-temporal learning framework (ECSNet) that accommodates both object classification and action recognition tasks. The core of our framework is a hierarchical spatial relation module. Equipped with specially designed surface-event-based sampling unit and local event normalization unit to enhance the inter-event relation encoding, this module learns robust geometric features from the 2D event clouds. And we propose a motion attention module for efficiently capturing long-term temporal context evolving with the 1T cloud sequence. Empirically, the experiments show that our framework achieves par or even better state-of-the-art performance. Importantly, our approach cooperates well with the sparsity of event data without any sophisticated operations, hence leading to low computational costs and prominent inference speeds.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural network has proved its effectiveness in image aesthetic quality assessment (IAQA), but still lacks reasonable interpretability. Aesthetic attributes provide rich intermediate-level information for understanding the underlying principles of image aesthetics, but has not been fully investigated. Psychological studies have shown that aesthetic experience involves hierarchical stages, i.e., human process image aesthetics following a staged information processing mechanism. Motivated by this, this paper presents a Hierarchical Image Aesthetic Attribute (HIAA) prediction model, aiming to imitate the staged mechanism of human aesthetic experience. Image aesthetic attributes are first divided into several hierarchical groups. Then, hierarchical features are extracted from the cascaded layers of the deep neural network to predict the aesthetic attributes in a group-wise manner. The overall image aesthetic score is also predicted by aggregating the hierarchical features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HIAA model outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of both aesthetic attribute prediction and aesthetic score regression.",

      "abstract": "Various image enhancement algorithms are adopted to improve underwater images that often suffer from visual distortions. It is critical to assess the output quality of underwater images undergoing enhancement algorithms, and use the results to optimise underwater imaging systems. In our previous study, we created a benchmark for quality assessment of underwater image enhancement via subjective experiments. Building on the benchmark, this paper proposes a new objective metric that can automatically assess the output quality of image enhancement, namely UWEQM. By characterising specific underwater physics and relevant properties of the human visual system, image quality attributes are computed and combined to yield an overall metric. Experimental results show that the proposed UWEQM metric yields good performance in predicting image quality as perceived by human subjects.",

Despite the popularity of color-guided methods for sparse-to-dense depth completion, they treated pixels equally during optimization, ignoring the uneven distribution characteristics in the sparse depth map and the accumulated outliers in the synthesized ground truth. In this work, we introduce uncertainty-driven loss functions to improve the robustness of depth completion and handle the uncertainty in depth completion. Specifically, we propose an explicit uncertainty formulation for robust depth completion with Jeffrey's prior. A parametric uncertain-driven loss is introduced and translated to new loss functions that are robust to noisy or missing data. Meanwhile, we propose a multiscale joint prediction model that can simultaneously predict depth and uncertainty maps. The estimated uncertainty map is also used to perform adaptive prediction on the pixels with high uncertainty, leading to a residual map for refining the completion results. Our method has been tested on KITTI Depth Completion Benchmark and achieved the state-of-the-art robustness performance in terms of MAE, IMAE, and IRMSE metrics.",

      "abstract": "With the boom of deep neural networks, blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has achieved great processes. However, the current BIQA metrics are limited when evaluating low-quality images as compared to medium-quality and high-quality images, which restricts their applications in real world problems. In this paper, we first identify that two challenges caused by distribution shift and long-tailed distribution lead to the compromised performance on low-quality images. Then, we propose an intermediary enhancement-based bilateral network with iterative training strategy for solving these two challenges. Drawing on the experience of transitive transfer learning, the proposed metric adaptively introduces enhanced intermediary images to transfer more information to low-quality images for mitigating the distribution shift. Our metric also adopts an iterative training strategy to deal with the long-tailed distribution. This strategy decouples feature extraction and score regression for better representation learning and regressor training. It not only transfers the knowledge learned from the earlier stage to the latter stage, but also makes the model pay more attention to long-tailed low-quality images. We conduct extensive experiments on five authentically distorted image quality datasets. The results show that our metric significantly improves the evaluating performance on low-quality images and delivers state-of-the-art intra-dataset results. During generalization tests, our metric also achieves the best cross-dataset performance",

      "abstract": "Personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA) is challenging due to its highly subjective nature. People's aesthetic tastes depend on diversified factors, including image characteristics and subject characters. The existing PIAA databases are limited in terms of annotation diversity, especially the subject aspect, which can no longer meet the increasing demands of PIAA research. To solve the dilemma, we conduct so far, the most comprehensive subjective study of personalized image aesthetics and introduce a new Personalized image Aesthetics database with Rich Attributes (PARA), which consists of 31,220 images with annotations by 438 subjects. PARA features wealthy annotations, including 9 image-oriented objective attributes and 4 human-oriented subjective attributes. In addition, desensitized subject information, such as personality traits, is also provided to support study of PIAA and user portraits. A comprehensive analysis of the annotation data is provided and statistic study indicates that the aesthetic preferences can be mirrored by proposed subjective attributes. We also propose a conditional PIAA model by utilizing subject information as conditional prior. Experimental results indicate that the conditional PIAA model can outperform the control group, which is also the first attempt to demonstrate how image aesthetics and subject characters interact to produce the intricate personalized tastes on image aesthetics. We believe the database and the associated analysis would be useful for conducting next-generation PIAA study. The project page of PARA can be found at: https://cv-datasets.institutecv.com/#/data-sets.",

      "abstract": "Panoramic image quality assessment (PIQA) is crucial to the successful application of technologies that can provide immersive visual experience. Stitching distortions are one of the main types of distortions that result in panoramic image degradation. However, most existing PIQA methods are general-purpose ones, which ignore the special characteristics of the stitching distortions caused by imperfect stitching algorithms. This results in unsatisfactory performance. To this end, we propose an effective stitched PIQA method, which consists of an imaginary reference generation (IRG) module and a hierarchical quality prediction (HQP) module. Among them, the IRG module is proposed to mimic the capability of the human visual system in imagining the raw version in the face of a degraded image. For the IRG module learning, we construct a large-scale database. The HQP module is presented to adapt to the particularity and complexity of stitching distortions, which is achieved by the pyramid feature aggregation. Extensive experiments and comparisons have been performed on the stitched PIQA database and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in evaluating the quality of stitched panoramic images.",

      "abstract": "More and more users are getting used to posting images and text on social networks to share their emotions or opinions. Accordingly, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a research topic of increasing interest in recent years. Typically, there exist affective regions that evoke human sentiment in an image, which are usually manifested by corresponding words in peoples comments. Similarly, people also tend to portray the affective regions of an image when composing image descriptions. As a result, the relationship between image affective regions and the associated text is of great significance for multimodal sentiment analysis. However, most of the existing multimodal sentiment analysis approaches simply concatenate features from image and text, which could not fully explore the interaction between them, leading to suboptimal results. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new image-text interaction network (ITIN) to investigate the relationship between affective image regions and text for multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modal alignment module to capture region-word correspondence, based on which multimodal features are fused through an adaptive cross-modal gating module. Moreover, considering the complementary role of context information on sentiment analysis, we integrate the individual-modal contextual feature representations for achieving more reliable prediction. Extensive experimental results and comparisons on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA), which aims to predict people's emotions towards different visual stimuli, has become an attractive research topic recently. Rather than a single label classification task, it is more rational to regard VEA as a Label Distribution Learning (LDL) problem by voting from different individuals. Existing methods often predict visual emotion distribution in a unified network, neglecting the inherent subjectivity in its crowd voting process. In psychology, the Object-Appraisal-Emotion model has demonstrated that each individual's emotion is affected by his/her subjective appraisal, which is further formed by the affective memory. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Subjectivity Appraise-and-Match Network (SAMNet) to investigate the subjectivity in visual emotion distribution. To depict the diversity in crowd voting process, we first propose the Subjectivity Appraising with multiple branches, where each branch simulates the emotion evocation process of a specific individual. Specifically, we construct the affective memory with an attention-based mechanism to preserve each individual's unique emotional experience. A subjectivity loss is further proposed to guarantee the divergence between different individuals. Moreover, we propose the Subjectivity Matching with a matching loss, aiming at assigning unordered emotion labels to ordered individual predictions in a one-to-one correspondence with the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on public visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SAMNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Ablation study verifies the effectiveness of our method and visualization proves its interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Physical acquisition of high-resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) has remained difficult, despite its potential of resolving material-related ambiguities in vision applications. Deep hyperspectral image fusion, aiming at reconstructing an HR-HSI from a pair of low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI), has become an appealing computational alternative. Existing fusion methods either rely on hand-crafted image priors or treat fusion as a nonlinear mapping problem, ignoring important physical imaging models. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization strategy to fully exploit the spatio-spectral dependency by a spatially adaptive 3D filter. Moreover, the joint exploitation of spatio-spectral regularization and physical imaging models inspires us to formulate deep hyperspectral image fusion as a differentiable optimization problem. We show how to solve this optimization problem by an end-to-end training of a model-guided unfolding network named DHIF-Net. Unlike existing works of simply concatenating spatial with spectral regularization, our approach aims at an end-to-end optimization of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">iterative</i> spatio-spectral regularization by multistage network implementations. Our extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets have shown that our DHIF-Net outperforms other competing methods in terms of both objective and subjective visual quality.",

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has witnessed a flourishing progress due to the rapid advances in deep learning technique. The vast majority of prior BIQA methods try to leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate the data shortage problem. These well-trained models, however, can be sub-optimal when applied to BIQA task that varies considerably from the image classification domain. To address this issue, we make the first attempt to leverage the plentiful unlabeled data to conduct self-supervised pre-training for BIQA task. Based on the distorted images generated from the high-quality samples using the designed distortion augmentation strategy, the proposed pre-training is implemented by a feature representation prediction task. Specifically, patch-wise feature representations corresponding to a certain grid are integrated to make prediction for the representation of the patch below it. The prediction quality is then evaluated using a contrastive loss to capture quality-aware information for BIQA task. Experimental results conducted on KADID-10 k and KonIQ-10 k databases demonstrate that the learned pre-trained model can significantly benefit the existing learning based IQA models.",

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA), which is capable of precisely and automatically estimating human perceived image quality with no pristine image for comparison, attracts extensive attention and is of wide applications. Recently, many existing BIQA methods commonly represent image quality with a quantitative value, which is inconsistent with human cognition. Generally, human beings are good at perceiving image quality in terms of semantic description rather than quantitative value. Moreover, cognition is a needs-oriented task where humans are able to extract image contents with local to global semantics as they need. The mediocre quality value represents coarse or holistic image quality and fails to reflect degradation on hierarchical semantics. In this paper, to comply with human cognition, a novel quality caption model is inventively proposed to measure fine-grained image quality with hierarchical semantics degradation. Research on human visual system indicates there are hierarchy and reverse hierarchy correlations between hierarchical semantics. Meanwhile, empirical evidence shows that there are also bi-directional degradation dependencies between them. Thus, a novel bi-directional relationship-based network (BDRNet) is proposed for semantics degradation description, through adaptively exploring those correlations and degradation dependencies in a bi-directional manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of both evaluation performance and generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "One challenge facing image quality assessment (IQA) is that current models designed or trained on the basis of exiting databases are intrinsically suboptimal and cannot deal with the real-world complexity and diversity of natural scenes. IQA models and databases are heavily skewed toward the visibility of distortions. It is critical to understand the wider determinants of perceived quality and use the new understanding to improve the predictive power of IQA models. Human behavioral categorization performance is powerful and essential for visual tasks. However, little is known about the impact of natural scene categories (SCs) on perceived image quality. We hypothesize that different classes of natural scenes influence image quality perception—how image quality is perceived is not only affected by the lower level image statistics and image structures shared between different categories but also by the semantic distinctions between these categories. In this article, we first design and conduct a fully controlled psychovisual experiment to verify our hypothesis. Then, we propose a computational framework that integrates the natural SC-specific component into image quality prediction. Research demonstrates the importance and plausibility of considering natural SCs in future IQA databases and models.",

      "abstract": "Due to the rapid increase in video traffic and relatively limited delivery infrastructure, end users often experience dynamically varying quality over time when viewing streaming videos. The user quality-of-experience (QoE) must be continuously monitored to deliver an optimized service. However, modern approaches for continuous-time video QoE estimation require densely annotating the continuous-time QoE labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To cope with such limitations, we propose a novel weakly-supervised domain adaptation approach for continuous-time QoE evaluation, by making use of a small amount of continuously labeled data in the source domain and abundant weakly-labeled data (only containing the retrospective QoE labels) in the target domain. Specifically, given a pair of videos from source and target domains, effective spatiotemporal segment-level feature representation is first learned by a combination of 2D and 3D convolutional networks. Then, a multi-task prediction framework is developed to simultaneously achieve continuous-time and retrospective QoE predictions, where a quality attentive adaptation approach is investigated to effectively alleviate the domain discrepancy without hampering the prediction performance. This approach is enabled by explicitly attending to the video-level discrimination and segment-level transferability in terms of the domain discrepancy. Experiments on benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the prediction performance under the cross-domain setting.",

      "abstract": "随着科学技术的发展，虚拟现实(virtual reality, VR)技术逐渐渗透到医疗、教育、军事和娱乐等众多领域，并凭借在各个领域广阔的应用前景而受到广泛关注。鉴于视觉质量是决定VR技术能否成功应用的关键，且图像是VR应用最基础和最重要的视觉信息载体，VR图像质量评价已经成为质量评价领域的重要前沿性研究方向。与传统图像质量评价类似，VR图像质量评价可以分为主观质量评价和客观质量评价。由于客观质量评价相比主观质量评价具有成本低、稳定性高和应用范围广等优点，对VR图像客观质量评价的研究受到了国内外学者的高度重视。目前，关于VR图像客观质量评价的研究已经取得了一定进展，但是文献中缺少对该方向相关研究方法的综述。基于此，本文针对VR图像客观质量评价的研究进行概述。首先，对VR图像质量评价的研究现状进行分析。然后，重点对现有的VR图像客观质量评价模型进行综述。具体地，根据模型是否需要使用原始无失真图像信息作为参考，将现有的VR图像客观质量评价模型划分为全参考型和无参考型两大类。其中，全参考型方法进一步划分为基于峰值信噪比/结构相似度的方法和基于传统机器学习的方法。根据特征表达空间的不同，无参考型VR图像质量评价模型划分为3类：基于等矩形投影表达空间的方法、基于其他投影表达空间的方法和基于实际观看空间的方法。介绍完各类模型后，分别对其相应的优缺点进行分析。此外，本文对VR图像客观质量评价模型的性能评价指标和现有VR图像质量评价数据库进行了归纳。最后对VR图像客观质量评价模型的应用进行了介绍，并指出了未来的研究可能的发展方向。",

      "abstract": "目的人脸识别技术已经在众多领域中得到广泛应用，然而现有识别方法对于人脸图像的质量要求普遍较高，低质量图像会严重影响系统的识别性能，产生误判。人脸图像质量评价方法可用于高质量图像的筛选，对改善人脸识别系统的性能有重要作用。不同于传统的图像质量评价，人脸图像质量评价是一种可用性评价，目前对其研究较少。人们在进行人脸识别时往往主要通过眼睛、鼻子、嘴等关键区域；基于此，本文提出了一种基于掩膜的人脸图像质量无参考评价方法，通过挖掘脸部关键区域对人脸识别算法的影响计算人脸图像质量。方法人脸识别方法通常需要比较输入人脸图像和高质量基准图像之间的特征相似度；本文从另一个角度出发，在输入人脸图像的基础上构造低可用性图像作为伪参考，并通过计算输入人脸图像和伪参考图像间的相似性获得输入人脸图像的质量评价分数。具体地，对一幅输入的人脸图像，首先对其关键区域添加掩膜获得低可用性质量的掩膜人脸图像，然后将输入图像和掩膜图像输入特征提取网络以获得人脸特征，最后计算特征间的距离获得输入人脸图像的质量分数。结果用AOC(错误拒绝曲线围成的区域面积)作为评估指标，在5个数据集上将本文方法与其他主流的人脸质量评价方法进行了充分比较，在LFW(labeled faces in the wild)数据集中比性能第2的模型提升了14.8%，在CelebA(celebFaces attribute)数据集中提升了0.1%，在DDFace(diversified distortion face)数据集中提升了2.9%，在VGGFace2(Visual Geometry Group Face2)数据集中提升了3.7%，在CASIA-WebFace(Institute of Automation，Chinese Academy of Science-Website Face)数据集中提升了4.9%。结论本文提出的基于掩膜的人脸图像质量评价方法，充分利用了人脸识别的关键性区域，将人脸识别的特点融入到人脸图像质量评价算法的设计中，能够在不需要参考图像的条件下准确预测出不同失真程度下的人脸图像质量分数，并且性能优于目前的主流方法。",

      "abstract": "Video quality assessment (VQA) task is an ongoing small sample learning problem due to the costly effort required for manual annotation. Since existing VQA datasets are of limited scale, prior research tries to leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate this kind of shortage. Nonetheless, these well-trained models targeting on image classification task can be sub-optimal when applied on VQA data from a significantly different domain. In this paper, we make the first attempt to perform self-supervised pre-training for VQA task built upon contrastive learning method, targeting at exploiting the plentiful unlabeled video data to learn feature representation in a simple-yet-effective way. Specifically, we implement this idea by first generating distorted video samples with diverse distortion characteristics and visual contents based on the proposed distortion augmentation strategy. Afterwards, we conduct contrastive learning to capture quality-aware information by maximizing the agreement on feature representations of future frames and their corresponding predictions in the embedding space. In addition, we further introduce distortion prediction task as an additional learning objective to push the model towards discriminating different distortion categories of the input video. Solving these prediction tasks jointly with the contrastive learning not only provides stronger surrogate supervision signals, but also learns the shared knowledge among the prediction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised learning for VQA task. Our results also underscore that the learned pre-trained model can significantly benefit the existing learning based VQA models. Source code is available at https://github.com/cpf0079/CSPT.",

      "abstract": "Due to the widespread popularity of social media, researchers have developed a strong interest in learning the personalized image aesthetics of online users. Personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA) aims to study the aesthetic preferences of individual users for images, which should be affected by the properties of both users and images. Existing PIAA approaches usually use the generic aesthetics learned from images as a prior model and adapt it to PIAA models through a small number of data annotated by individual users. However, the prior model merely learns the objective attributes of images, which is agnostic to the subjective attributes of users, complicating efficient learning of the personalized image aesthetics of individual users. Therefore, we propose a personalized image aesthetics assessment method that integrates the subjective attributes of users and objective attributes of images simultaneously. To characterize these two attributes jointly, an attribute extraction module is introduced to learn users' personality traits and image aesthetic attributes. Then, an aesthetic prior model is built from numerous individual users' annotated data, which leverages the personality traits of users and the aesthetic attributes of rated images as prior knowledge to model both the image aesthetic distribution and users' residual scores relative to generic aesthetics simultaneously. Finally, a PIAA model is obtained by fine-tuning the aesthetic prior model with an individual user's annotated data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to existing PIAA methods in learning individual users' personalized image aesthetics.",

      "abstract": "Image quality assessment (IQA) for authentic distortions in the wild is challenging. Though current IQA metrics have achieved decent performance for synthetic distortions, they still cannot be satisfactorily applied to realistic distortions because of the generalization problem. Improving generalization ability is an urgent task to make IQA algorithms serviceable in real-world applications, while relevant research is still rare. Fundamentally, image quality is determined by both distortion degree and intelligibility. However, current IQA metrics mostly focus on the distortion aspect and do not fully investigate the intelligibility, which is crucial for achieving robust quality estimation. Motivated by this, this paper presents a new framework for building highly generalizable image quality model by integrating the intelligibility. We first analyze the relation between intelligibility and image quality. Then we propose a bilateral network to integrate the above two aspects of image quality. During the fusion process, feature selection strategy is further devised to avoid negative transfer. The framework not only catches the conventional distortion features but also integrates intelligibility features properly, based on which a highly generalizable no-reference image quality model is achieved. Extensive experiments are conducted based on five intelligibility tasks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art metrics, and the intelligibility task consistently improves metric performance and generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel quality caption model is inventively developed to assess the image quality with hierarchical semantics. Existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods usually represent image quality with a quantitative value, resulting in inconsistency with human cognition. Generally, human beings are good at perceiving image quality in terms of semantic description rather than quantitative value. Moreover, cognition is a needs-oriented task where hierarchical semantics are extracted. The mediocre quality value fails to reflect degradations on hierarchical semantics. Therefore, a new IQA framework is proposed to describe the quality for needs-oriented cognition. A novel quality caption procedure is firstly introduced, in which the quality is represented as patterns of activation distributed across the diverse degradations on hierarchical semantics. Then, an attentive and recurrent semantic attractor network (ARSANet) is designed to activate the distributed patterns for image quality description. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and is highly compliant with human cognition.",

      "abstract": "Blind assessment of video quality is still challenging even in this deep learning era. The limited number of samples in existing databases is insufficient to learn a good feature extractor for video quality assessment (VQA), while manually labeling a larger database with subjective perception is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. To relieve such difficulty, we first collect 3589 high-quality video clips as the reference and build a large VQA dataset. The dataset contains more than 300K samples degraded by various distortion types due to compression and transmission error, and provides weak labels for each distorted sample with several full-reference VQA algorithms. To learn effective representation from the weakly labeled data, we alleviate the bias of single weak label (i.e., single knowledge) via learning from multiple heterogeneous knowledge. To this end, we propose a novel no-reference VQA (NR-VQA) method with HEterogeneous Knowledge Ensemble (HEKE). Comparing to learning from single knowledge, HEKE can theoretically reach a lower infimum, and learn richer representation due to the heterogeneity. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed HEKE outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The source code will be available at https://github.com/Sissuire/BVQA-HEKE.",

      "abstract": "During the last years, convolutional neural networks (C-NNs) have triumphed over video quality assessment (VQA) tasks. However, CNN-based approaches heavily rely on annotated data which are typically not available in VQA, leading to the difficulty of model generalization. Recent advances in domain adaptation technique makes it possible to adapt models trained on source data to unlabeled target data. However, due to the distortion diversity and content variation of the collected videos, the intrinsic subjectivity of VQA tasks hampers the adaptation performance. In this work, we propose a curriculum-style unsupervised domain adaptation to handle the cross-domain no-reference VQA problem. The proposed approach could be divided into two stages. In the first stage, we conduct an adaptation between source and target domains to predict the rating distribution for target samples, which can better reveal the subjective nature of VQA. From this adaptation, we split the data in target domain into confident and uncertain subdomains using the proposed uncertainty-based ranking function, through measuring their prediction confidences. In the second stage, by regarding samples in confident subdomain as the easy tasks in the curriculum, a fine-level adaptation is conducted between two subdomain-s to fine-tune the prediction model. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of the proposed method over the competing methods in both accuracy and speed.

To relieve such difficulty, we first build a video dataset, which contains over 320K samples suffering from various compression and transmission artifacts. While manually annotating the dataset with subjective perception is much labor-intensive and time-consuming, we adopt reference-based VQA algorithms to weakly label the data automatically. We consider that single weak label is derived from single knowledge, which is deficient and incomplete for VQA. To alleviate the bias from single weak label (i.e., single knowledge) in the weakly labeled dataset, we propose HEterogeneous Knowledge Ensemble (HEKE) for spatiotemporal representation learning. Compared to learning from single knowledge, learning with HEKE is thought to achieve a lower infimum theoretically, and obtain richer representation. On the basis of the built dataset and the HEKE methodology, a feature encoder specific to BVQA is formed, and directly extract spatiotemporal representation from videos. Then, the video quality can be either acquired in a completely BVQA manner without ground truth, or via a finetuning-based regressor with labels. Extensive experiments on various VQA databases show that our BVQA model with the pretrained encoder achieves the state-of-the-art performance. More surprisingly, even trained on the synthetic data, our model still shows competitive performance on authentic databases.

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) for authentic distortions is still a great challenge, even in today's deep learning era. It has been widely acknowledged that local and global features are both indispensable for IQA, which play complementary roles. While combining local and global features is straightforward in traditional handcrafted feature-based IQA metrics, it is not an easy task in the deep learning framework. This is mainly due to the fact that deep neural networks typically require input images with a fixed size. Current metrics either resize the image or use local patches as input, which are problematic in that they cannot integrate local and global aspects as well as their interactions to achieve comprehensive quality evaluation. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a new BIQA metric for authentic distortions by aggregating local and global deep features in a Vision-Transformer framework. In the proposed metric, selective local regions and global content are simultaneously input for complementary feature extraction, and the Vision-Transformer is employed to build the relationship between different local patches and image quality. Self-attention mechanism is further adopted to explore the interaction between local and global deep features, producing the final image quality score. Extensive experiments on five authentically distorted IQA databases demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of both prediction performance and generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Video quality assessment (VQA) is much more challenging than image quality assessment, due to the difficulty of modeling temporal influence among frames. Most of the existing VQA methods usually isolate each moment within the video (i.e., it neglects the sequential nature), leading to a large gap from the subjective perception. Recent research on neuroscience suggests a serially dependent perception (SDP) mechanism in the human visual system (HVS). Namely, the HVS tends to incorporate the recent past visual experience to predict the present perception. Inspired by the SDP, we suggest that the HVS prefers stable and continuous degradations in videos due to their predictability, and exhibits less tolerance to interrupted and unpredictable disturbances. Thus, we introduce a novel serial dependence modeling (SDM) framework for full-reference VQA in this paper. Firstly, the instantaneous degradation is measured on both the static appearance and motion information for each glimpse of scenes. Since motion plays an important role in videos, two types of structures are extracted for motion representation, namely, an explicit content-based 3D structure and an implicit feature-based 2D structure. Next, an assessment-directed long-short term memory (A-LSTM) is proposed to capture the serial dependence among instantaneous degradations. With the consideration of the perceptual effect from the previous moment on the current one, especially the effect from the perceptually worst moment, the serially dependent degradation is characterized. Finally, by mimicking the subjective rating for video-viewing, an attention-based quality decision procedure is presented to acquire the final video quality. Experimental results on publicly available VQA databases demonstrate that the proposed method maintains good consistency with the subjective perception.",

      "abstract": "Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has attracted increasing attention recently with the prevalence of sharing images on social networks. Since human emotions are ambiguous and subjective, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm rather than a single-label classification task. Different from other LDL tasks, there exist intrinsic relationships between emotions and unique characteristics within them, as demonstrated in psychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded circular-structured representation to utilize the prior knowledge for visual emotion distribution learning. To be specific, we first construct an Emotion Circle to unify any emotional state within it. On the proposed Emotion Circle, each emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is defined with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion intensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides, we design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the dissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and labeled one in a coarse-to-fine manner, which further boosts the learning process in an emotion-specific way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on public visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, a distortion discrimination assisted multi-stream network is proposed for OI quality assessment. The multi-stream architecture is constructed by generating the viewport images received by the retina at one point to simulate the characteristics of humans perceiving VR contents. Additionally, the strategy of generating several viewport image sets from one OI is proposed for data augmentation. Furthermore, the facts that the human brain has the ability for both quality assessment and distortion type distinguishment, and the process of human brain handling two tasks exists information interaction inspire us to employ an auxiliary distortion discrimination task to facilitate the quality assessment task learning. Extensive experiments conducted on two public OI databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to both traditional 2D quality metrics and existing metrics specific for OIs. Moreover, utilizing the assistant task is proven to be more effective than the single task learning for OI quality evaluation. Better generalization performance is also verified to be another valuable trait of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Recently, researchers have shown great interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA). Due to the lack of big training data, the efforts of existing metrics in optimizing CNN-based NR-IQA models remain limited. Furthermore, the diversity of distortions in images result in the generalization problem of NR-IQA models when trained with known distortions and tested on unseen distortions, which is an easy task for human. Hence, we propose a NR-IQA metric via deep meta-learning, which is highly generalizable in the face of unseen distortions. The fundamental idea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality of images with diversified distortions. Specifically, we define NR-IQA of different distortions as a series of tasks and propose a task selection strategy to build two task sets, which are characterized by synthetic to synthetic and synthetic to authentic distortions, respectively. Based on these two task sets, an optimization-based meta-learning is proposed to learn the generalized NR-IQA model, which can be directly used to evaluate the quality of images with unseen distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NR-IQA metric outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of both evaluation performance and generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has recently reshaped our understanding on various vision tasks. Similar to the success of NAS in high-level vision tasks, it is possible to find a memory and computationally efficient solution via NAS with highly competent denoising performance. However, the optimization gap between the super-network and the sub-architectures has remained an open issue in both low-level and high-level vision. In this paper, we present a novel approach to filling in this gap by connecting model-guided design with NAS (MoD-NAS) and demonstrate its application into image denoising. Specifically, we propose to construct a new search space under model-guided framework and develop more stable and efficient differential search strategies. MoD-NAS employs a highly reusable width search strategy and a densely connected search block to automatically select the operations of each layer as well as network width and depth via gradient descent. During the search process, the proposed MoG-NAS is capable of avoiding mode collapse due to the smoother search space designed under the model-guided framework. Experimental results on several popular datasets show that our MoD-NAS has achieved even better PSNR performance than current state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters, lower number of flops, and less amount of testing time.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communication has achieved great success in the past several decades. The challenge is of improving bandwidth with limited spectrum and power consumption, which however has gradually become a bottleneck with evolution going on. The intrinsic problem is that communication is modeled as a message transportation from sender to receiver and pursues for an exact message replication in Shannon's information theory, which certainly leads to large bandwidth and power requirements with data explosion. However, the goal for communication among intelligent agents, entities with intelligence including humans, is to understand the meaning or semantics underlying data, not an accurate recovery of the transmitted messages. The separate first transmission and then understanding is a waste on bandwidth. In this article, we deploy semantics to solve the spectrum and power bottleneck and propose a first understanding and then transmission framework with high semantic fidelity. We first give a brief introduction of semantics covering the definition and properties to show the insights and scope of this paper. Then the proposed communication towards semantic fidelity framework is introduced, which takes the above mentioned properties into account to further improve efficiency. Specially, a semantic transformation is introduced to transform the input into semantic symbols. Different from the conventional transformations in signal processing area, for example discrete cosine transform, the transformation is with data loss, which is also the reason that the proposed framework can achieve large bandwidth saving with high semantic fidelity. Besides, we also discuss semantic noise and performance measurement. To evaluate the effectiveness, a case study of audio transmission is carried out. Finally, we discuss the typical applications and open challenges.",

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is a useful but challenging task. It is a promising idea to design BIQA methods by mimicking the working mechanism of human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) indicates that the HVS actively infers the primary content (i.e., meaningful information) of an image for better understanding. Inspired by that, this paper presents a novel BIQA metric by mimicking the active inference process of IGM. Firstly, an active inference module based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is established to predict the primary content, in which the semantic similarity and the structural dissimilarity (i.e., semantic consistency and structural completeness) are both considered during the optimization. Then, the image quality is measured on the basis of its primary content. Generally, the image quality is highly related to three aspects, i.e., the scene information (content-dependency), the distortion type (distortion-dependency), and the content degradation (degradation-dependency). According to the correlation between the distorted image and its primary content, the three aspects are analyzed and calculated respectively with a multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) based quality evaluator. As a result, with the help of the primary content obtained from the active inference and the comprehensive quality degradation measurement from the multi-stream CNN, our method achieves competitive performance on five popular IQA databases. Especially in cross-database evaluations, our method achieves significant improvements.",

      "abstract": "Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) aims at finding out how people feel emotionally towards different visual stimuli, which has attracted great attention recently with the prevalence of sharing images on social networks. Since human emotion involves a highly complex and abstract cognitive process, it is difficult to infer visual emotions directly from holistic or regional features in affective images. It has been demonstrated in psychology that visual emotions are evoked by the interactions between objects as well as the interactions between objects and scenes within an image. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Scene-Object interreLated Visual Emotion Reasoning network (SOLVER) to predict emotions from images. To mine the emotional relationships between distinct objects, we first build up an Emotion Graph based on semantic concepts and visual features. Then, we conduct reasoning on the Emotion Graph using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), yielding emotion-enhanced object features. We also design a Scene-Object Fusion Module to integrate scenes and objects, which exploits scene features to guide the fusion process of object features with the proposed scene-based attention mechanism. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on eight public visual emotion datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SOLVER consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our method and visualizations prove its interpretability, which also bring new insight to explore the mysteries in VEA. Notably, we further discuss SOLVER on three other potential datasets with extended experiments, where we validate the robustness of our method and notice some limitations of it.",

      "abstract": "Quality of experience (QoE) that serves as a direct evaluation of viewing experience from the end users is of vital importance for network optimization, and should be constantly monitored. Unlike existing video-on-demand streaming services, real-time interactivity is critical to the mobile live broadcasting experience for both broadcasters and their audiences. While existing QoE metrics that are validated on limited video contents and synthetic stall patterns have shown effectiveness in their trained QoE benchmarks, a common caveat is that they often encounter challenges in practical live broadcasting scenarios, where one needs to accurately understand the activity in the video with fluctuating QoE and figure out what is going to happen to support the real-time feedback to the broadcaster. In this paper, we propose a temporal relational reasoning guided QoE evaluation approach for mobile live video broadcasting, namely TRR-QoE, which explicitly attends to the temporal relationships between consecutive frames to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the distortion-aware variation. In our design, video frames are first processed by deep neural network (DNN) to extract quality-indicative features. Afterwards, besides explicitly integrating features of individual frames to account for the spatial distortion information, multi-scale temporal relational information corresponding to diverse temporal resolutions are made full use of to capture temporal-distortion-aware variation. As a result, the overall QoE prediction could be derived by combining both aspects. The results of experiments conducted on a number of benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of TRR-QoE over the representative state-of-the-art metrics.",

      "abstract": "The widespread screen sharing poses a great challenge in the visual quality control of industrial applications, as there is a significant difference between the visual quality perception of natural content (NC) and screen content (SC) images (or videos) during <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">acquisition</i> , <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">compression</i> , <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">distribution</i> , and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">display</i> . Apart from the foreground distortion, artifacts appeared in the smooth background of SC images also play a key role in its perceived quality. In this article, a robust approach is designed for quality measurement of SC images, which embodies both foreground perception and background suppression (FPBS) in a satisfying way. Specifically, the extraction of foreground perceptual features is investigated by considering both the local contrast variation and the local edge response features, while for the first time, a suppression strategy is devised to eliminate the influences of artifacts appeared in the simple and homogeneous background. Experimental results show that, based on only two simple features, the proposed scheme achieves the state-of-the-art results on two latest benchmark databases. We believe that the feature engineering method can further improve the performance of the FPBS framework on the quality measurement of screen images.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) based methods have achieved great success in\\nsingle image super-resolution (SISR). However, existing state-of-the-art SISR\\ntechniques are designed like black boxes lacking transparency and\\ninterpretability. Moreover, the improvement in visual quality is often at the\\nprice of increased model complexity due to black-box design. In this paper, we\\npresent and advocate an explainable approach toward SISR named model-guided\\ndeep unfolding network (MoG-DUN). Targeting at breaking the coherence barrier,\\nwe opt to work with a well-established image prior named nonlocal\\nauto-regressive model and use it to guide our DNN design. By integrating deep\\ndenoising and nonlocal regularization as trainable modules within a deep\\nlearning framework, we can unfold the iterative process of model-based SISR\\ninto a multi-stage concatenation of building blocks with three interconnected\\nmodules (denoising, nonlocal-AR, and reconstruction). The design of all three\\nmodules leverages the latest advances including dense/skip connections as well\\nas fast nonlocal implementation. In addition to explainability, MoG-DUN is\\naccurate (producing fewer aliasing artifacts), computationally efficient (with\\nreduced model parameters), and versatile (capable of handling multiple\\ndegradations). The superiority of the proposed MoG-DUN method to existing\\nstate-of-the-art image SR methods including RCAN, SRMDNF, and SRFBN is\\nsubstantiated by extensive experiments on several popular datasets and various\\ndegradation scenarios.\\n",

      "abstract": "Video quality assessment (VQA), which is capable of automatically predicting the perceptual quality of source videos especially when reference information is not available, has become a major concern for video service providers due to the growing demand for video quality of experience (QoE) by end users. While significant advances have been achieved from the recent deep learning techniques, they often lead to misleading results in VQA tasks given their limitations on describing 3D spatio-temporal regularities using only fixed temporal frequency. Partially inspired by psychophysical and vision science studies revealing the speed tuning property of neurons in visual cortex when performing motion perception (i.e., sensitive to different temporal frequencies), we propose a novel no-reference (NR) VQA framework named Recurrent-In-Recurrent Network (RIRNet) to incorporate this characteristic to prompt an accurate representation of motion perception in VQA task. By fusing motion information derived from different temporal frequencies in a more efficient way, the resulting temporal modeling scheme is formulated to quantify the temporal motion effect via a hierarchical distortion description. It is found that the proposed framework is in closer agreement with quality perception of the distorted videos since it integrates concepts from motion perception in human visual system (HVS), which is manifested in the designed network structure composed of low- and high- level processing. A holistic validation of our methods on four challenging video quality databases demonstrates the superior performances over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of free-viewpoint video applications, virtual view synthesis has attracted extensive attention. In view synthesis, a new viewpoint is generated from the input color and depth images with a depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) algorithm. Current quality evaluation models for view synthesis typically operate on the synthesized images, i.e. after the DIBR process, which is computationally expensive. So a natural question is that can we infer the quality of DIBR-based synthesized images using the input color and depth images directly without performing the intricate DIBR operation. With this motivation, this paper presents a no-reference image quality prediction model for view synthesis via COlor-Depth Image Fusion, dubbed CODIF, where the actual DIBR is not needed. First, object boundary regions are detected from the color image, and a Wavelet-based image fusion method is proposed to imitate the interaction between color and depth images during the DIBR process. Then statistical features of the interactional regions and natural regions are extracted from the fused color-depth image to portray the influences of distortions in color/depth images on the quality of synthesized views. Finally, all statistical features are utilized to learn the quality prediction model for view synthesis. Extensive experiments on public view synthesis databases demonstrate the advantages of the proposed metric in predicting the quality of view synthesis, and it even suppresses the state-of-the-art post-DIBR view synthesis quality metrics.",

      "abstract": "To meet the ever-increasing demand for devices with diversified displays, image retargeting has become a prevalent technique for adaptive image resizing. In practice, the retargeting operation inevitably causes impairments in the images; thus, image retargeting quality assessment (IRQA) is urgently needed and, can be used to guide algorithm optimization, selection and design. Unlike traditional image quality assessment, image retargeting introduces geometric distortions, which typically affect high-level image semantics. With this motivation, this paper presents a quality evaluation model for image retargeting based on INstance SEMantics (INSEM). Considering that the human visual system (HVS) perceives images highly dependent on apprehensible areas and that impairments in image retargeting mainly degrade the salient instances, an image instance is utilized as the basic semantic unit, and a top-down method is devised to extract instance-level semantic features for IRQA. In addition, taking into account the influence of semantic categories on the perception of retargeting quality, we further propose Semantic-based self-adaptive pooling (SSAP) to integrate instance-based semantic features. Finally, global features are incorporated to generate quality scores that are more consistent with people's perceptions. Extensive experiments and comparisons of three public databases, in terms of both intradatabase and cross-database settings, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric over state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of multimedia produces a huge amount of images every day. Some can be remembered by us for a long time, while most of them are quickly forgotten. This intrinsic property of an image is called memorability, which has wide applications in advertising, photography, education and so on. Therefore, image memorability has been drawing increasing interest recently. People's unique taste of beauty influences their memory of images, however, there are few works assisting memorability prediction by utilizing visual aesthetics assessment. In this paper, we propose a new aesthetics-assisted multi-task deep learning network for image memorability estimation. Visual attention mechanism is employed in our network to focus on the most useful context information. In order to capture the common features between image memorability and aesthetics, we use image memorability data and image aesthetics data to train the multi-task deep network with attention alternately. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of multi-view and free-viewpoint videos, the view synthesis has gained extensive attention. In view synthesis, the new viewpoint is generated from color and depth images by a depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) algorithm. The quality of color and depth images is crucial for generating a new high-quality viewpoint. However, DIBR is computationally expensive, thus how to infer the quality of DIBR-synthesized image by only using the input color and depth images is highly desired. With this motivation, this paper presents a no-reference metric to predict the quality of DIBR-synthesized images using statistics of fused color-depth images without actual DIBR process. Specifically, a wavelet-based fusion strategy is first proposed to simulate the interactions between color and depth distortions during the DIBR process. Then the multi-scale statistical features are extracted from the fused color-depth image. Finally, the back propagation (BP) regression network is employed for building the quality prediction model for DIBR-synthesized images. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric over the state-of-the-arts.",

      "abstract": "No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) is a challenging task. It is a promising idea to design NR-IQA algorithms by mimicking how human visual system (HVS) works. The internal generative mechanism (IGM) indicates that HVS actively infers the primary content of an image for better understanding. Inspired by that, a novel NR-IQA method with active inference is proposed in this paper. First, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to predict the primary content of a distorted image, in which two IGM-inspired constraints are considered during the optimization. Next, based on the correlation between the distorted image and its primary content, different degradations (i.e., the content/distortion-/structure-dependency degradation) are measured simultaneously with a multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) for NR-IQA. Benefit from the primary content obtained from GAN and the multiple degradations measurement of CNN, our method achieves the state-of-the-art on five public IQA databases.",

      "abstract": "Recently, increasing interest has been drawn in exploiting deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA). Despite of the notable success achieved, there is a broad consensus that training DCNNs heavily relies on massive annotated data. Unfortunately, IQA is a typical small sample problem. Therefore, most of the existing DCNN-based IQA metrics operate based on pre-trained networks. However, these pre-trained networks are not designed for IQA task, leading to generalization problem when evaluating different types of distortions. With this motivation, this paper presents a no-reference IQA metric based on deep meta-learning. The underlying idea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality of images with various distortions, which can then be adapted to unknown distortions easily. Specifically, we first collect a number of NR-IQA tasks for different distortions. Then meta-learning is adopted to learn the prior knowledge shared by diversified distortions. Finally, the quality prior model is fine-tuned on a target NR-IQA task for quickly obtaining the quality model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin. Furthermore, the meta-model learned from synthetic distortions can also be easily generalized to authentic distortions, which is highly desired in real-world applications of IQA metrics.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a new type of neuromorphic event-based sensor, which has an innate advantage in capturing fast-moving objects. Due to the interference of DVS hardware itself and many external factors, noise is unavoidable in the output of DVS. Different from frame/image with structural data, the output of DVS is in the form of address-event representation (AER), which means that the traditional denoising methods cannot be used for the output (i.e., event stream) of the DVS. In this paper, we propose a novel event stream denoising method based on probabilistic undirected graph model (PUGM). The motion of objects always shows a certain regularity/trajectory in space and time, which reflects the spatio-temporal correlation between effective events in the stream. Meanwhile, the event stream of DVS is composed by the effective events and random noise. Thus, a probabilistic undirected graph model is constructed to describe such priori knowledge (i.e., spatio-temporal correlation). The undirected graph model is factorized into the product of the cliques energy function, and the energy function is defined to obtain the complete expression of the joint probability distribution. Better denoising effect means a higher probability (lower energy), which means the denoising problem can be transfered into energy optimization problem. Thus, the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm is used to optimize the model to remove the noise. Experimental results on denoising show that the proposed algorithm can effectively remove noise events. Moreover, with the preprocessing of the proposed algorithm, the recognition accuracy on AER data can be remarkably promoted.",

      "abstract": "A tone-mapped image (TMI) obtained from the corresponding high dynamic range (HDR) image induces artifacts and distortion, which might result in the loss of structure information and impaired color. By analyzing the visual characteristics of TMIs, this work proposes a robust blind visual quality evaluation method for TMIs by using gradient and chromatic statistics (VQGC). First, motivated by the perceptual mechanism that the human visual system (HVS) is sensitive to image structure variation, we employ the gradient features to measure structure degradation in TMIs. To predict structure distortion accurately, we compute the gradient magnitude and orientation to measure image structure variation, and the relative gradient magnitude and orientation are also computed to capture microstructure change. Second, the color invariance descriptors are utilized to capture the visual degradation of colorfulness by local binary pattern (LBP) on four chromatic feature maps. Finally, the gradient and chromatic features are combined together as the final quality-aware feature vector, which is applied to assess the perceptual quality of TMIs by support vector regression (SVR). Comparison experiments show that the performance of the proposed method is better than other existing blind quality assessment methods on public databases.",

      "abstract": "Previous research has suggested that social exclusion could strengthen consumers' reliance on feelings versus reasons to evaluate a product. This research concentrates on the moderating effect of culture on consumers' responses to social exclusion. Results show that under individualism (collectivism) culture, social exclusion leads to a greater choice preference for advertisement with superior feelings- (reasons-) based product attributes, compared with social inclusion. Moreover, we find that the interplay between culture and social exclusion is discrepant under two types of social exclusion (i.e., being socially ignored—feeling invisible, and being socially rejected—feeling isolated). This research provides a new cultural perspective on the impact of social exclusion on advertisement persuasion and offers actionable implications for managers to strategically design advertisements to enhance the persuasiveness.",

      "abstract": "Virtual view synthesis plays a vital role in the application of multi-view and free-viewpoint videos. Depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) is the most commonly used approach in view synthesis, and many DIBR algorithms have been proposed. However, how to evaluate the quality of DIBR-synthesized images and benchmark the DIBR algorithms are still very challenging, which may hinder the further development of the view synthesis technique. Hence, an effective quality metric for evaluating the distortions in view synthesis is urgently needed. With this motivation, this paper presents a quality index for view synthesis by simultaneously measuring local Instance DEgradation and global Appearance (IDEA). Due to the imperfection of rendering algorithms, local geometric distortions are easily introduced around instance contours, causing instance degradation, which is the dominant distortion in synthesized views. In this work, image instances are first detected and local instance degradation is measured based on discrete orthogonal moments. Meantime, we propose to measure the global appearance of synthesized images based on the superpixel representation. By integrating both local and global aspects of the distortions, a more accurate quality model is built for view synthesis. Extensive experiments and comparisons have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in evaluating the quality of DIBR-synthesized images and benchmarking the performance of view synthesis algorithms.",

      "abstract": "A novel colour image watermarking scheme based on Schur decomposition is proposed in this paper. By analysing the 3 × 3 unitary matrix U via Schur decomposition, the strong similarity relation between U2,1 and U3,1 is found. This relation will represent one kind of embedded watermark information, i.e., '1' or '0', and will be used to extract watermark from 3 × 3 unitary matrix U in the blind manner. Moreover, the proposed method requires lower computational complexity than other methods based on singular value decomposition (SVD) since Schur decomposition is only an intermediate step in SVD decomposition. In addition, the proposed method does not have the false-positive detection problem like that based on SVD. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of invisibility, robustness, capacity and real-time feature.",

      "abstract": "Traditional image aesthetics assessment (IAA) approaches mainly predict the average aesthetic score of an image. However, people tend to have different tastes on image aesthetics, which is mainly determined by their subjective preferences. As an important subjective trait, personality is believed to be a key factor in modeling individual's subjective preference. In this paper, we present a personality-assisted multi-task deep learning framework for both generic and personalized image aesthetics assessment. The proposed framework comprises two stages. In the first stage, a multi-task learning network with shared weights is proposed to predict the aesthetics distribution of an image and Big-Five (BF) personality traits of people who like the image. The generic aesthetics score of the image can be generated based on the predicted aesthetics distribution. In order to capture the common representation of generic image aesthetics and people's personality traits, a Siamese network is trained using aesthetics data and personality data jointly. In the second stage, based on the predicted personality traits and generic aesthetics of an image, an inter-task fusion is introduced to generate individual's personalized aesthetic scores on the image. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using two public image aesthetics databases. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in both generic and personalized IAA tasks.",

      "abstract": "The quality of depth images is crucial for virtual view synthesis. However, the quality assessment of depth images is still largely unexplored. This letter presents a blind quality metric of Depth image based on Structural Statistics (DSS). The design philosophy is inspired by the fact that structural distortion in the depth images usually leads to geometric distortion, which is the main cause for degraded quality of synthesized views. Specifically, the statistical features for shape and orientation are calculated based on discrete orthogonal moments and gradients, generating two groups of quality-aware features. Then, the quality model is built from the extracted statistical features using a regression module. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, live broadcasting video has become increasingly popular and high‐quality live broadcasting video is highly needed. In practice, live broadcasting videos usually undergo several processing stages, which inevitably introduce multiple distortions, e. g. frame freezing and intensity mutation, causing the degraded quality of experience. However, little work has been done to the quality evaluation of live broadcasting videos, which may hinder the further development of more advanced live broadcasting video delivery systems. Motivated by this, this study presents a no‐reference quality evaluation model for live broadcasting videos (LBVQA) in temporal and spatial domains. In the temporal domain, statistic features are extracted to measure the frame freezing and intensity mutation, and the entropy‐based feature is extracted to describe the global jitter. In the spatial domain, blurring is measured based on phase coherence, and abnormal exposure ratio is calculated based on an adaptive threshold. Finally, all features are fed into a backpropagation neural network to train the quality prediction model. Experimental results on the Live Broadcasting Video Database demonstrate the advantages of the proposed metric over the state‐of‐the‐art image and video quality metrics.",

With the center-surround mechanism in the human visual system (HVS), the proposed method extracts the statistical features on chromatic and textural variations in SCIs to measure the visual distortion. First, by considering the chromatic continuity between spatially adjacent pixels, photo-metric invariant chromatic descriptors are extracted as zero-order and first-order features. Second, motivated by the perceptual mechanism that the HVS is sensitive to image texture variation, we employ local ternary pattern operator to effectively depict the spatial continuity of texture. With these extracted chromatic and textural features, we further adopt histogram to compute the statistical chromatic and textural features. Support vector regression (SVR) is used to train the quality prediction model from visual features to human ratings. Experimental results on three public benchmark databases demonstrate that the performance of our method is superior to the current blind image quality assessment methods, even better than some full reference image quality assessment counterparts.",

      "abstract": "Blur is one of the most common distortions that degrade natural images. This stimulates the blossom of sharpness assessment metrics. Existing sharpness metrics possess good performance for evaluating simulated blur, but are limited for the more common realistic blur that are introduced during image capture and processing in real life. To this end, we propose an effective Realistic Blur Assessment method (RBA) based on discrepancy learning. First, motivated by the fact that the distortion-free reference images are usually unavailable in practice, but the Human Visual System (HVS) can still accurately perceive image sharpness by quantifying the perceptual discrepancy between the distorted image and the hallucinated reference image in mind, we propose to train a discrepancy generation model to automatically generate the discrepancy map from the distorted image analogous to the HVS. This is achieved by using a deep neural network with rich training images. With the discrepancy map, two sharpness-aware features, i.e. sparse representation based entropy of primitive and content-guided variation of power, are then extracted to severally quantify spatial visual information amount and spectral power. Finally, the two features are integrated to produce the overall sharpness score. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.",

      "abstract": "Free viewpoint video (FVV) has received considerable attention owing to its widespread applications in several areas such as immersive entertainment, remote surveillance and distanced education. Since FVV images are synthesized via a depth image-based rendering (DIBR) procedure in the \"blind\" environment (without reference images), a real-time and reliable blind quality assessment metric is urgently required. However, the existing image quality assessment metrics are insensitive to the geometric distortions engendered by DIBR. In this research, a novel blind method of DIBR-synthesized images is proposed based on measuring geometric distortion, global sharpness and image complexity. First, a DIBR-synthesized image is decomposed into wavelet subbands by using discrete wavelet transform. Then, the Canny operator is employed to detect the edges of the binarized low-frequency subband and high-frequency subbands. The edge similarities between the binarized low-frequency subband and high-frequency subbands are further computed to quantify geometric distortions in DIBR-synthesized images. Second, the log-energies of wavelet subbands are calculated to evaluate global sharpness in DIBR-synthesized images. Third, a hybrid filter combining the autoregressive and bilateral filters is adopted to compute image complexity. Finally, the overall quality score is derived to normalize geometric distortion and global sharpness by the image complexity. Experiments show that our proposed quality method is superior to the competing reference-free state-of-the-art DIBR-synthesized image quality models.",

      "abstract": "The great variations of videographic skills in shot environment, photographic apparatus, compression and processing protocols give rise to very complicated impairments in the live broadcasting videos, which can adversely impact the quality of experience (QoE) of end users. Evaluating QoE of these videos is of great significance. Given the fact that there is still no publicly available database that studies the combined effects of the distortions in the live broadcasting videos, we have built the Live Broadcasting Video Database (LBVD) with the associated QoE scores. Towards depicting the distortions in live broadcasting videos, totally 1013 videos were included in the database, with diversified, authentic distortions. A subjective evaluation of these videos is conducted, and the correlation results between the tested state-of-the-art objective metrics and the subjective QoE scores on this database reveal that further studies are in urgent need for a better objective QoE metric dedicated to the live broadcasting videos.",

      "abstract": "With the prevalence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), assessing the aesthetics of an image has gained great advances recently. Individual users often have different aesthetic preferences on images, which we believe are mainly affected by their personality traits. However, most of the current aesthetics models predict a generic aesthetic score based on handcrafted and/or learned feature representations, which are unified and thus cannot reflect the individual differences during image aesthetic rating. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end personality driven multi-task deep learning model to address this problem. Firstly, both image aesthetics and personality traits are learned from the proposed multi-task model. Then the personality features are employed to modulate the aesthetics features, producing the optimal generic image aesthetics scores. The experimental results on two public databases show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "This letter presents an objective quality index for benchmarking image inpainting algorithms. Under the guidance of the masks of damaged areas, the boundary region and the inpainting region are first located. Then, the statistical features are extracted from the boundary and inpainting regions respectively. For the boundary region, we utilize Weibull distribution to fit the gradient magnitude histograms of the exterior and interior regions around the boundary, and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) is calculated to measure the boundary distortions caused by imperfect inpainting. Meanwhile, the quality of the inpainting region is measured by comparing the naturalness factors between the inpainted image and the reference image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art quality metrics.",

      "abstract": "Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a specific cross-modal retrieval task for retrieving natural images with free-hand sketches under zero-shot scenario. Previous works mostly focus on modeling the correspondence between images and sketches or synthesizing image features with sketch features. However, both of them ignore the large intra-class variance of sketches, thus resulting in unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end semantic adversarial approach for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, we devise a semantic adversarial module to maximize the consistency between learned semantic features and category-level word vectors. Moreover, to preserve the discriminability of synthesized features within each training category, a triplet loss is employed for the generative module. Additionally, the proposed model is trained in an end-to-end strategy to exploit better semantic features suitable for ZS-SBIR. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale popular datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by more than 12\\% on Sketchy dataset and about 3\\% on TU-Berlin dataset in the retrieval.",

      "abstract": "View synthesis is a key technique in free-viewpoint video, which renders virtual views based on texture and depth images. The distortions in synthesized views come from two stages, i.e., the stage of the acquisition and processing of texture and depth images, and the rendering stage using depth-image-based-rendering (DIBR) algorithms. The existing view synthesis quality metrics are designed for the distortions caused by a single stage, which cannot accurately evaluate the quality of the entire view synthesis process. With the considerations that the distortions introduced by two stages both cause edge degradation and texture unnaturalness, and the Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) representation is powerful in capturing image edge and texture characteristics by simulating the center-surrounding receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells of human eyes, this paper presents a no-reference quality index for Synthesized views using DoG-based Edge statistics and Texture naturalness (SET). To mimic the multi-scale property of the Human Visual System (HVS), DoG images are first calculated at multiple scales. Then the orientation selective statistics features and the texture naturalness features are calculated on the DoG images and the coarsest scale image, producing two groups of quality-aware features. Finally, the quality model is learnt from these features using the random forest regression model. Experimental results on two view synthesis image databases demonstrate that the proposed metric is advantageous over the relevant state-of-the-arts in dealing with the distortions in the whole view synthesis process.",

      "abstract": "Image restoration has attracted substantial attention recently and many image restoration algorithms have been proposed for restoring latent clear images from degraded images. However, determining how to objectively evaluate the performances of these algorithms remains an open problem, which may hinder the further development of advanced image restoration techniques. Most image restoration quality metrics are designed for specific restoration applications; hence, their generalization ability is limited. For benchmarking image restoration algorithms, the ranking of restored images that are generated via various algorithms is the most heavily considered factor. Inspired by this, this paper presents a pairwise-comparison-based rank learning framework for benchmarking the performances of image restoration algorithms, which focuses on the relative quality ranking of restored images. Under the proposed framework, we further propose a general image restoration quality metric by integrating quality-aware features in both the spatial and frequency domains. The proposed metric exhibits good generalization performance, and it is applicable to various restoration applications. The results of extensive experiments that were conducted on eight public databases of five restoration scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the existing quality metrics. Moreover, the proposed framework is used to improve the existing quality metrics for benchmarking image restoration algorithms and highly encouraging results are obtained.",

      "abstract": "With the prevalence of social media, users tend to use visual content to convey their preferences in on-line communication. This allows us to infer users' personality traits by their preferred images. Since users tend to have different preferences on image regions, modeling their traits from the holistic image may be problematic. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end weakly supervised dual convolutional network (WSDCN) for personality prediction, which consists of a classification network and a regression network. The classification network has the advantage of capturing class-specific localized image regions while only requiring the image-level class labels. In order to obtain the personality class-specific localized activation map (class activation map), the Big-Five (BF) traits are firstly converted into ten personality class labels for the classification network. Secondly, the Multi-Personality Class Activation Map (MPCAM) is utilized as the localized activation of deep feature maps to generate local deep features, which are then combined with the holistic deep features for the regression network. Finally, the user liked images and the associated personality labels are trained by the end-to-end WSDCN for predicting the BF personality traits. Experimental results on the annotated PsychoFlickr database show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches, and the BF personality traits can be predicted simultaneously by the trained WSDCN model.",

      "abstract": "In this study, by using the quaternion algebra, multiple‐parameter fractional quaternion Fourier transform (MPFrQFT) is proposed to generalise the conventional multiple‐parameter fractional Fourier transform (MPFrFT) to quaternion signal processing in a holistic manner. First, the new transform MPFrQFT and its inverse transform are defined. An efficient discrete implementation method of MPFrQFT is then proposed, in which the relationship between MPFrQFT and MPFrFT of four components is utilised for a quaternion signal. Finally, a new colour image encryption algorithm based on the proposed MPFrQFT and the double random phase encoding technique is proposed to evaluate the performance of the proposed MPFrQFT. Experimental results demonstrate that: (i) the computational time of the proposed implementation method is almost a half of the direct method's time; (ii) the proposed MPFrQFT‐based encryption algorithm has an overall better performance than eight compared algorithms in security test and robustness test: it is more secure than the compared frequency‐based algorithms due to the larger key space and the more sensitive key ‘transform orders’; it is also more robust than the compared spatial‐domain algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Motion-compensated frame interpolation (MCFI), a frame-interpolation technique to increase the motion continuity of low frame-rate video, can be utilized by counterfeiters for faking high bitrate video or splicing videos with different frame rates. For existing MCFI detectors, their performances are degraded under real-world scenarios such as H.264/AVC compression, noise, or blur. To address this issue, a robust MCFI detector is proposed to locate interpolated frames. By analyzing the distribution of residual energies within interpolated frames, we observe that there exist strong correlations between artifact regions and high residual energies. Thus, an artifact indicated map is introduced to select candidate artifact regions. Then, Tchebichef moments (TMs) are exploited to characterize the blurring effects or deformed structures among these regions. Specifically, the mean value of absolute high-order TMs of selected regions is used to model these temporal inconsistencies. Finally, a sliding window is adopted to locate interpolated frames, which are further refined by three post-processing operations. Chrominance information is also integrated with luminance information for robust identification of interpolated frames. Extensive experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art MCFI detectors, the proposed approach is more robust for compressed videos under various real-world scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medical image fusion (MIF) attracts much attention in clinical use. Many MIF algorithms have been proposed over the past decade. Existing MIF algorithms create different fused image, however, current quality evaluation method is not designed for MIF images. So, we present a no reference quality evaluation of medical image fusion. Firstly, a MIF image database (MIFID) is built, and radiologist ratings are selected to conduct subjective test. Then an objective quality evaluation metric of medical image fusion is proposed via the phase congruency and standard deviation. Image salient features and image information are very important for visual quality of fused image. Based on this consideration, we combine the two existing quality evaluation metrics to assess MIF images. Finally, five comparative study experiments are implemented based on the MIFID. Experimental results reveal that the proposed quality evaluation metric is superior to the existing state‐of‐the‐art metrics, which is more applicable to evaluate MIF images.",

      "abstract": "In the past decade, extensive image quality metrics have been proposed. The majority of them are tailored for the images that contain a specific type of distortion. However, in practice, the images are usually degraded by different types of distortions simultaneously. This poses great challenges to the existing quality metrics. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a no-reference quality index for the multiply distorted images using the biorder structure degradation and the nonlocal statistics. The design philosophy is inspired by the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is highly sensitive to the degradations of both the spatial contrast and the spatial distribution, which are prone to be changed by the joint effects of the multiple distortions. Specifically, the multiresolution representation of the image is first built by downsampling to simulate the hierarchical property of the HVS. Then, the structure degradation is calculated to measure the spatial contrast. Considering the fact that the human visual cortex has the separate mechanisms to perceive the first- and second-order structures, dubbed biorder structures, the degradations of biorder structures are calculated to account for the spatial contrast, producing the first group of the quality-aware features. Furthermore, the nonlocal self-similarity statistics is calculated to measure the spatial distribution, producing the second group of features. Finally, all the features are fed into the random forest regression model to learn the quality model for the multiply distorted images. Extensive experimental results conducted on the three public databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric to the state-of-the-art metrics. Moreover, the proposed metric is also advantageous over the existing metrics in terms of the generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Motion deblurring has been widely studied. However, the relevant quality evaluation of motion deblurred images remains an open problem. The motion deblurred images are usually contaminated by noise, ringing and residual blur (NRRB) simultaneously. Unfortunately, most of the existing quality metrics are not designed for multiply distorted images, so they are limited in predicting the quality of motion deblurred images. In this study, the authors propose a new quality metric for motion deblurred images by measuring NRRB. For a motion deblurred image, the noise level is first estimated. Then the ringing effect is measured by incorporating visual saliency model to adapt to the characteristic of the human visual system. A reblurring‐based method is proposed to extract similarity features between a motion deblurred image and its re‐blurred version for evaluating the residual blur. Finally, the overall quality score of a motion deblurred image is obtained by pooling the scores of noise, ringing and blur. Experimental results conducted on a motion deblurring database demonstrate that the proposed metric significantly outperforms the existing quality metrics. In addition, the proposed NRRB metric is used for improving the existing general‐purpose no‐reference metrics, and very encouraging results are achieved.",

      "abstract": "Natural image quality assessment (NIQA) wins increasing attention, while NIQA models are rarely used in the medical community. A couple of studies employ the NIQA methodologies for medical image quality assessment (MIQA), but building the benchmark data sets necessitates considerable time and professional skills. In particular, the characteristics of synthesized distortions are different from those of clinical distortions, which make the results not so convincing. In clinic, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is widely used, which is defined as the quotient of the mean signal intensity measured in a tissue region of interest (ROI) and the standard deviation of the signal intensity in an air region outside the imaged object, and both regions are outlined by specialists. We take advantage of the knowledge that SNR is routinely used and concern whether SNR measure can perform as a baseline metric for the development of MIQA algorithms. To address the issue, the inter-observer reliability of SNR measure is investigated regarding to different tissue ROIs [white matter (WM); cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)] in magnetic resonance (MR) images. A total of 192 T<sub>2</sub>, 88 T<sub>1</sub>, 76 T<sub>2</sub> and 55 contrast-enhanced T<sub>1</sub> (T<sub>1</sub>C) weighted images are analyzed. Statistical analysis indicates that SNR values show consistency between different observers to the same ROI in each modality (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<sub>w</sub> &#x2265; 0.11; and paired sample t-test, pp 0.28). Moreover, whether off-the-shelf NIQA models can predict MR image quality is considered by using SNR values as the reference scores. Four NIQA models (BIQI, BLIINDS-II, BRISQUE, and NIQE) are evaluated, and the correlation between SNR values and NIQA results is evaluated. Pearson correlation coefficient (r<sub>p</sub>) shows that WM-based SNR values correlates well with BIQI, BLIINDS-II and BRISQUE in T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> images (rp 0.77), BRISQUE and NIQE in T<sub>1</sub> images (r<sub>p</sub> &#x2265; 0.75), BLIINDS-II in T<sub>2</sub> images (rp 0.67), and BRISQUE and NIQE in T<sub>1</sub>C images (r<sub>p</sub> &#x2265; 0.58), while CSF-based SNR values correlates well with BLIINDS-II in T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> images (r<sub>p</sub> &#x2265; 0.64) and T<sub>2</sub> images (r<sub>p</sub> &#x2265; 0.60), and all p<sub>p</sub> &lt;; 10<sup>-4</sup>. The prediction performance analysis further proves the result from the correlation analysis. Conclusively, SNR measure is reliable to different observations and can perform as a baseline indicator for the development of MIQA algorithms. In general, BRISQUE and BLIINDS-II are full of potential to be conditionally used as objective MIQA models toward human brain MR images. This paper presents the first attempt of using SNR measure to bridge the gap between NIQA and MIQA, and large-scale experiments should be further conducted to confirm the conclusion in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Reduced-reference (RR) image quality assessment (IQA), which aims to use a small amount of the reference information but achieve high accuracy, is greatly demanded in quality-orientated systems. In order to design a better RR IQA model which performs consistently with the subjective perception, the inner mechanism of the human visual system (HVS) is usually investigated and imitated. In this paper, the attention mechanism is thoroughly analyzed and used for RR IQA modeling. Generally, the HVS is more sensitive to the distortion on the attended region than that on the unattended region. Thus, the saliency of each region is calculated to highlight its importance, and a saliency weighted local structure (SWLS)-based histogram is created for visual structure degradation measurement. Meanwhile, the distortion may cause attention shift (changing the attended region). In other words, the difference of attention between the reference and distorted images can efficiently represent the quality degradation. Therefore, the attention distribution is analyzed with the salient map, and an orientation located global saliency (OLGS)-based histogram is built for attention shift measurement. Finally, combining the quality degradations from both SWLS and OLGS, a novel attended visual content degradation-based RR IQA method is introduced.<sup>1</sup> Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method uses only several values (18 values) and performs consistently with the subjective perception. Moreover, the proposed attention procedure can be easily extended to the existing RR IQA models and improve their performances.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel no reference quality assessment method by incorporating statistical luminance and texture features (NRLT) for screen content images (SCIs) with both local and global feature representation. The proposed method is designed inspired by the perceptual property of the human visual system (HVS) that the HVS is sensitive to luminance change and texture information for image perception. In the proposed method, we first calculate the luminance map through the local normalization, which is further used to extract the statistical luminance features in global scope. Second, inspired by existing studies from neuroscience that high-order derivatives can capture image texture, we adopt four filters with different directions to compute gradient maps from the luminance map. These gradient maps are then used to extract the second-order derivatives by local binary pattern. We further extract the texture feature by the histogram of high-order derivatives in global scope. Finally, support vector regression is applied to train the mapping function from quality-aware features to subjective ratings. Experimental results on the public large-scale SCI database show that the proposed NRLT can achieve better performance in predicting the visual quality of SCIs than relevant existing methods, even including some full reference visual quality assessment methods.",

      "abstract": "Depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) is a fundamental technique in free viewpoint video, which is widely adopted to synthesize virtual viewpoints. The warping and rendering operations in DIBR generally introduce geometric distortions and sharpness change. The state-of-the-art quality indices are limited in dealing with such images since they are sensitive to geometric changes. In this paper, a new quality model for DIBR-synthesized view images is presented by measuring LOcal Geometric distortions in disoccluded regions and global Sharpness (LOGS). A disoccluded region detection method is first proposed using SIFT-flow-based warping. Then, the sizes and distortion strength of local disoccluded regions are combined to generate a score. Furthermore, a reblurring-based strategy is proposed to quantify the global sharpness. Finally, the overall quality score is calculated by pooling the scores of local disoccluded regions and global sharpness. Experiments on four public DIBR-synthesized image/video databases show the superiority of the proposed metric over the state-of-the-art quality models. The proposed method is further adopted for boosting the performances of existing quality metrics and benchmarking DIBR algorithms, both achieving very promising results.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, single-image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction has aroused wide attention. Massive SR enhancement algorithms have been proposed. However, much less work has been down on the perceptual evaluation of SR enhanced images and the corresponding enhancement algorithms. In this work, we create a Super-resolution Reconstructed Image Database (SRID), which consists of images produced by two interpolation methods and six popular SR image enhancement algorithms at different amplification factors. Then, subjective experiment is conducted to collect the subjective scores by using the single-stimulus method. The performances of the SR image enhancement algorithms are then evaluated by the obtained subjective scores. Finally, the performances of the general-purpose no-reference (NR) image quality metrics are investigated on the SRID database. This study shows that it is difficult for the state-of-the-art NR image quality metrics to predict the quality of SR enhanced images.",

Furthermore, we extract the texture features from high order derivatives which can capture the details of image texture, in which we use the sobel filters to compute the gradient map based on the luminance map which is considered the first order derivatives, the texture features are extracted from the second order derivatives calculated based on the gradient map by the local binary patterns (LBPs). Both luminance and texture features are represented in the form of histogram. The support vector regression (SVR) is adopted as the mapping function from the quality-aware features to subjective ratings. Experimental results on the large-scale SCI database show that the proposed method can obtain better performance of visual quality prediction of SCIs than other existing methods and even including some full reference visual quality assessment methods.",

      "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment can be modeled as feature extraction followed by score prediction. It necessitates considerable expertise and efforts to handcraft features for optimal representation of perceptual image quality. This paper addresses blind image sharpness assessment by using a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN). The network takes single feature layer to unearth intrinsic features for image sharpness representation and utilizes multilayer perceptron (MLP) to rate image quality. Different from traditional methods, CNN integrates feature extraction and score prediction into an optimization procedure and retrieves features automatically from raw images. Moreover, its prediction performance can be enhanced by replacing MLP with general regression neural network (GRNN) and support vector regression (SVR). Experiments on Gaussian blur images from LIVE-II, CSIQ, TID2008 and TID2013 demonstrate that CNN features with SVR achieves the best overall performance, indicating high correlation with human subjective judgment.",

      "abstract": "The just noticeable difference (JND) in an image, which reveals the visibility limitation of the human visual system (HVS), is widely used for visual redundancy estimation in signal processing. To determine the JND threshold with the current schemes, the spatial masking effect is estimated as the contrast masking, and this cannot accurately account for the complicated interaction among visual contents. Research on cognitive science indicates that the HVS is highly adapted to extract the repeated patterns for visual content representation. Inspired by this, we formulate the pattern complexity as another factor to determine the total masking effect: the interaction is relatively straightforward with a limited masking effect in a regular pattern, and is complicated with a strong masking effect in an irregular pattern. From the orientation selectivity mechanism in the primary visual cortex, the response of each local receptive field can be considered as a pattern; therefore, in this paper, the orientation that each pixel presents is regarded as the fundamental element of a pattern, and the pattern complexity is calculated as the diversity of the orientation in a local region. Finally, considering both pattern complexity and luminance contrast, a novel spatial masking estimation function is deduced, and an improved JND estimation model is built. Experimental results on comparing with the latest JND models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which performs highly consistent with the human perception. The source code of the proposed model is publicly available at http://web.xidian.edu.cn/wjj/en/index.html.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Multimodal medical image fusion plays a vital role in clinical diagnoses and treatment planning. In many image fusion methods‐based pulse coupled neural network (PCNN), normalized coefficients are used to motivate the PCNN, and this makes the fused image blur, detail loss, and decreases contrast. Moreover, they are limited in dealing with medical images with different modalities. In this article, we present a new multimodal medical image fusion method based on discrete Tchebichef moments and pulse coupled neural network to overcome the aforementioned problems. First, medical images are divided into equal‐size blocks and the Tchebichef moments are calculated to characterize image shape, and energy of blocks is computed as the sum of squared non‐DC moment values. Then to retain edges and textures, the energy of Tchebichef moments for blocks is introduced to motivate the PCNN with adaptive linking strength. Finally, large firing times are selected as coefficients of the fused image. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state‐of‐the‐art methods and it is more effective in processing medical images with different modalities. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "A fast reliable computational quality predictor is eagerly desired in practical image/video applications, such as serving for the quality monitoring of real-time coding and transcoding. In this paper, we propose a new perceptual image quality assessment (IQA) metric based on the human visual system (HVS). The proposed IQA model performs efficiently with convolution operations at multiscales, gradient magnitude, and color information similarity, and a perceptual-based pooling. Extensive experiments are conducted using four popular large-size image databases and two multiply distorted image databases, and results validate the superiority of our approach over modern IQA measures in efficiency and efficacy. Our metric is built on the theoretical support of the HVS with lately designed IQA methods as special cases.",

      "abstract": "Blurring is one of the most common distortions in digital images. In the past decade, extensive image deblurring algorithms have been proposed to restore a latent clean image from its blurred version. However, very little work has been dedicated to the quality assessment of deblurred images, which may hinder further development of more advanced deblurring techniques. Motivated by this, this paper presents a no-reference quality metric for defocus deblured images based on Natural Scene Statistics (NSS). Two categories of NSS features are extracted in both the spatial and frequency domains to account for both the global and local aspects of distortions in deblurred images. Specifically, the spatial domain NSS features are used to characterize the global naturalness, and the frequency domain NSS features are used to portray the local structural distortions. All features are combined to train a support vector regression model for quality prediction of defocus deblurred images. The performance of the proposed metric is evaluated in a subjectively rated defocus deblurred image database. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed metric over the relevant state-of-the-arts. As an application, the proposed metric is further used for benchmarking deblurring algorithms and very encouraging results are achieved.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there are lots of visual tracking algorithms proposed to improve the performance of object tracking in video sequences with various real conditions, such as severe occlusion, complicated background, fast motion, and so on. In real visual tracking systems, there are various quality degradation occurring during video acquisition, transmission, and processing. However, most existing studies focus on improving the accuracy of visual tracking while ignoring the performance of tracking algorithms on video sequences with certain quality degradation. In this paper, we investigate the performance evaluation of existing visual tracking algorithms on video sequences with quality degradation. A quality-degraded video database for visual tracking (QDVD-VT), including the reference video sequences and their corresponding distorted versions, is constructed as the benchmarking for robustness analysis of visual tracking algorithms. Based on the constructed QDVD-VT, we propose a method for robustness measurement of visual tracking (RMVT) algorithms by accuracy rate and performance stability. The performance of ten existing visual tracking algorithms is evaluated by the proposed RMVT based on the built QDVD-VT. We provide the detailed analysis and discussion on the robustness analysis of different visual tracking algorithms on video sequences with quality degradation from different distortion types. To visualize the robustness of visual tracking algorithms well, we design a robustness pentagon to show the accuracy rate and performance stability of visual tracking algorithms. Our initial investigation shows that it is still challenging for effective object tracking for existing visual tracking algorithms on video sequences with quality degradation. There is much room for the performance improvement of existing tracking algorithms on video sequences with quality degradation in real applications.",

      "abstract": "The quality assessment of screen content images (SCIs) has been attractive recently. Different from natural images, SCI is usually a mixture of picture and text. Traditional quality metrics are mainly designed for natural images, which do not fit well into the SCIs. Motivated by this, this letter presents a simple and effective method to naturalize SCIs, so that the traditional quality models can be applied for SCI quality prediction. Specifically, bicubic interpolation-based up-sampling is proposed to achieve this goal. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

This letter proposes a DIBR-synthesized image quality metric by measuring the Statistics of both Edge Intensity and Orientation (SEIO). The Canny operator is first used to detect edges. Then the gradient maps are calculated, based on which the intensity and orientation of the edge pixels are computed for both the reference and synthesized images. The distance between the two intensity histograms and that between the two orientation histograms are computed. Finally, the two distances are pooled to obtain the overall quality score. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the presented method.",

      "abstract": "The human visual system exhibits multiscale characteristic when perceiving visual scenes. The hierarchical structures of an image are contained in its scale space representation, in which the image can be portrayed by a series of increasingly smoothed images. Inspired by this, this paper presents a no-reference and robust image sharpness evaluation (RISE) method by learning multiscale features extracted in both the spatial and spectral domains. For an image, the scale space is first built. Then sharpness-aware features are extracted in gradient domain and singular value decomposition domain, respectively. In order to take into account the impact of viewing distance on image quality, the input image is also down-sampled by several times, and the DCT-domain entropies are calculated as quality features. Finally, all features are utilized to learn a support vector regression model for sharpness prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on four synthetically and two real blurred image databases. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RISE metric is superior to the relevant state-of-the-art methods for evaluating both synthetic and real blurring. Furthermore, the proposed metric is robust, which means that it has very good generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Depth-Image-Based-Rendering (DIBR) is fundamental in free-viewpoint 3D video, which has been widely used to generate synthesized views from multi-view images. The majority of DIBR algorithms cause disoccluded regions, which are the areas invisible in original views but emerge in synthesized views. The quality of synthesized images is mainly contaminated by distortions in these disoccluded regions. Unfortunately, traditional image quality metrics are not effective for these synthesized images because they are sensitive to geometric distortions. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an objective quality evaluation method for 3D Synthesized images via Disoccluded Region Discovery (SDRD). A self-adaptive scale transform model is first adopted to preprocess the images on account of the impacts of view distance. Then disoccluded regions are detected by comparing the absolute difference between the preprocessed synthesized image and the warped image of preprocessed reference image. Furthermore, the disoccluded regions are weighted by a weighting function proposed to account for the varying sensitivities of human eyes to the size of disoccluded regions. Experiments conducted on IRCCyN/IVC DIBR image database demonstrate that the proposed SDRD method remarkably outperforms traditional 2D and existing DIBR-related quality metrics.",

While image enhancement has been extensively investigated, the relevant quality assessment of enhanced images remains an open problem, which may hinder further development of enhancement techniques. In this paper, a no-reference quality metric for digitally enhanced images is proposed. Three kinds of features are extracted for characterizing the quality of enhanced images, including non-structural information, sharpness and naturalness. Specifically, a total of 42 perceptual features are extracted and used to train a support vector regression (SVR) model. Finally, the trained SVR model is used for predicting the quality of enhanced images. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several enhancement-related databases, including a new enhanced image database built by the authors. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and advantage of the proposed metric.",

      "abstract": "During the past few years, there have been various kinds of content-aware image retargeting operators proposed for image resizing. However, the lack of effective objective retargeting quality assessment metrics limits the further development of image retargeting techniques. Different from traditional image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, the quality degradation during image retargeting is caused by artificial retargeting modifications, and the difficulty for image retargeting quality assessment (IRQA) lies in the alternation of the image resolution and content, which makes it impossible to directly evaluate the quality degradation like traditional IQA. In this paper, we interpret the image retargeting in a unified framework of resampling grid generation and forward resampling. We show that the geometric change estimation is an efficient way to clarify the relationship between the images. We formulate the geometric change estimation as a backward registration problem with Markov random field and provide an effective solution. The geometric change aims to provide the evidence about how the original image is resized into the target image. Under the guidance of the geometric change, we develop a novel aspect ratio similarity (ARS) metric to evaluate the visual quality of retargeted images by exploiting the local block changes with a visual importance pooling strategy. Experimental results on the publicly available MIT RetargetMe and CUHK data sets demonstrate that the proposed ARS can predict more accurate visual quality of retargeted images compared with the state-of-the-art IRQA metrics.",

      "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) has been attracting tremendous attention in recent years. Extensive CS recovery algorithms have been proposed for effective image reconstruction. However, little work has been dedicated to the perceptual evaluation of CS image recovery algorithms and the corresponding recovered images. In this paper, we first build a Compressive Sensing Recovered Image Database (CSRID), which contains images generated by ten popular CS image recovery algorithms at different sensing rates. We then carry out a subjective experiment using the single-stimulus method to obtain the subjective qualities of the images. The subjective scores are then used to evaluate the performances of the CS image recovery algorithms. Finally, the performances of general-purpose no-reference (NR) quality metrics and image blur metrics are investigated on the CSRID database. Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art quality metrics are very limited in predicting the quality of CS recovered images.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the problem of RGB color space identification from a single image. At the moment, RGB color spaces are widely adopted in photography for image producing. The problems with respect to color space identification, such as to get the consistent printing or displaying quality on screen devices and software applications and prevention of multimedia unauthorized usage(shown or printed by other device via gamut mapping), need to be concerned. Current techniques are all relying on EXchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) to extract color space information. In this paper, we use a two-dimensional non-causal regressive model to explore the image demosaicing properties in order to extract discriminative features and train them on SVM classifier for image color space detection without relying on EXIF. In our experiment, images in three different color spaces (sRGB, adobeRGB and pro PhotoRGB) are generated for color space identification task. The experimental results show that the proposed technique has an good performance on image color space identification.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in sparse representation show that overcomplete dictionaries learned from natural images can capture high-level features for image analysis. Since atoms in the dictionaries are typically edge patterns and image blur is characterized by the spread of edges, an overcomplete dictionary can be used to measure the extent of blur. Motivated by this, this paper presents a no-reference sparse representation-based image sharpness index. An overcomplete dictionary is first learned using natural images. The blurred image is then represented using the dictionary in a block manner, and block energy is computed using the sparse coefficients. The sharpness score is defined as the variance-normalized energy over a set of selected high-variance blocks, which is achieved by normalizing the total block energy using the sum of block variances. The proposed method is not sensitive to training images, so a universal dictionary can be used to evaluate the sharpness of images. Experiments on six public image quality databases demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "During the past few years, there have been various kinds of content-aware image retargeting methods proposed for image resizing. However, the lack of effective objective retargeting quality metric limits the further development of image retargeting. Different from the traditional image quality assessment, the quality degradation of the retargeted images is mainly caused by the geometric changes due to retargeting. In this paper, we propose a practical approach to reveal the geometric changes during image retargeting, and design an Aspect Ratio Similarity (ARS) metric to predict the visual quality of the retargeted image. The experimental results on the widely used dataset show that the proposed metric outperforms the state of the arts.",

      "abstract": "Image distortions are typically characterized by degradations of structures.Dictionaries learned from natural images can capture the underlying structures in images, which are important for image quality assessment (IQA).This paper presents a general-purpose no-reference image quality metric using a GRadient-Induced Dictionary (GRID).A dictionary is first constructed based on gradients of natural images using K-means clustering.Then image features are extracted using the dictionary based on Euclidean-norm coding and max-pooling.A distortion classification model and several distortion-specific quality regression models are trained using the support vector machine (SVM) by combining image features with distortion types and subjective scores, respectively.To evaluate the quality of a test image, the distortion classification model is used to determine the probabilities that the image belongs to different kinds of distortions, while the regression models are used to predict the corresponding distortion-specific quality scores.Finally, an overall quality score is computed as the probability-weighted distortion-specific quality scores.The proposed metric can evaluate image quality accurately and efficiently using a small dictionary.The performance of the proposed method is verified on public image quality databases.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric can generate quality scores highly consistent with human perception, and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",

      "abstract": "Distortions cause structural changes in digital images, leading to degraded visual quality. Dictionary-based sparse representation has been widely studied recently due to its ability to extract inherent image structures. Meantime, it can extract image features with slightly higher level semantics. Intuitively, sparse representation can be used for image quality assessment, because visible distortions can cause significant changes to the sparse features. In this paper, a new sparse representation-based image quality assessment model is proposed based on the construction of adaptive sub-dictionaries. An overcomplete dictionary trained from natural images is employed to capture the structure changes between the reference and distorted images by sparse feature extraction via adaptive sub-dictionary selection. Based on the observation that image sparse features are invariant to weak degradations and the perceived image quality is generally influenced by diverse issues, three auxiliary quality features are added, including gradient, color, and luminance information. The proposed method is not sensitive to training images, so a universal dictionary can be adopted for quality evaluation. Extensive experiments on five public image quality databases demonstrate that the proposed method produces the state-of-the-art results, and it delivers consistently well performances when tested in different image quality databases.",

      "abstract": "Image retouching is fundamental in photography, which is widely used to improve the perceptual quality of a low-quality image. Traditional image quality metrics are designed for degraded images, so they are limited in evaluating the quality of retouched images. This letter presents a RETouched Image QUality Evaluation (RETIQUE) algorithm by measuring structure and color changes between the original and retouched images. Structure changes are measured by gradient similarity. Color colorfulness and saturation are utilized to measure color changes. The overall quality score of a retouched image is computed as the linear combination of gradient similarity and color similarity. The performance of RETIQUE is evaluated on a public Digitally Retouched Image Quality (DRIQ) database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",

In order to improve its performance, a crowding distance measure based on the distance and the overlap degree of intervals, and a method of updating the archive based on the acceptance coefficient of decision-maker, are employed. Finally, results show that our algorithm is capable of generating excellent approximation of the true Pareto front.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a visual pattern degradation based full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) method. Researches on visual recognition indicate that the human visual system (HVS) is highly adaptive to extract visual structures for scene understanding. Existing structure degradation based IQA methods mainly take local luminance contrast to represent structure, and measure quality as degradation on luminance contrast. In this paper, we suggest that structure includes not only luminance contrast but also orientation information. Therefore, we analyze the orientation characteristic for structure description. Inspired by the orientation selectivity mechanism in the primary visual cortex, we introduce a novel visual pattern to represent the structure of a local region. Then, the quality is measured as the degradations on both luminance contrast and visual pattern. Experimental results on Five benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed visual pattern can effectively represent visual structure and the proposed IQA method performs better than the existing IQA metrics.",

      "abstract": "Blur is a key determinant in the perception of image quality. Generally, blur causes spread of edges, which leads to shape changes in images. Discrete orthogonal moments have been widely studied as effective shape descriptors. Intuitively, blur can be represented using discrete moments since noticeable blur affects the magnitudes of moments of an image. With this consideration, this paper presents a blind image blur evaluation algorithm based on discrete Tchebichef moments. The gradient of a blurred image is first computed to account for the shape, which is more effective for blur representation. Then the gradient image is divided into equal-size blocks and the Tchebichef moments are calculated to characterize image shape. The energy of a block is computed as the sum of squared non-DC moment values. Finally, the proposed image blur score is defined as the variance-normalized moment energy, which is computed with the guidance of a visual saliency model to adapt to the characteristic of human visual system. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on four public image quality databases. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can produce blur scores highly consistent with subjective evaluations. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art image blur metrics and several general-purpose no-reference quality metrics.",

      "abstract": "In a tampered blurred image generated by splicing, the spliced region and the original image may have different blur types. Splicing localization in this image is a challenging problem when a forger uses some postprocessing operations as antiforensics to remove the splicing traces anomalies by resizing the tampered image or blurring the spliced region boundary. Such operations remove the artifacts that make detection of splicing difficult. In this paper, we overcome this problem by proposing a novel framework for blurred image splicing localization based on the partial blur type inconsistency. In this framework, after the block-based image partitioning, a local blur type detection feature is extracted from the estimated local blur kernels. The image blocks are classified into out-of-focus or motion blur based on this feature to generate invariant blur type regions. Finally, a fine splicing localization is applied to increase the precision of regions boundary. We can use the blur type differences of the regions to trace the inconsistency for the splicing localization. Our experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method in the detection and the classification of the out-of-focus and motion blur types. For splicing localization, the result demonstrates that our method works well in detecting the inconsistency in the partial blur types of the tampered images. However, our method can be applied to blurred images only. .",

      "abstract": "Blur is one of the most common distortion type and greatly impacts image quality. Most existing no-reference (NR) image blur metrics produce scores without a fixed range, so it is hard to judge the extent of blur directly. This letter presents a NR perceptual blur metric using Saliency Guided Gradient Similarity (SGGS), which produces blur scores with a fixed range of (0,1). A blurred image is first reblurred using a Gaussian low-pass filter, producing a heavily blurred image. With this reblurred image as reference, a local blur map is generated by computing the gradient similarity. Finally, visual saliency is employed in the pooling to adapt to the characteristics of the human visual system (HVS). The proposed metric features fixed range, fast computation and better consistency with the HVS. Experiments demonstrate its advantages.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Seam carving is a content‐aware multimedia retargeting technique to adaptively resize multimedia data for different display sizes. However, it can also be used to remove objects from digital object or video for malicious purposes. In this paper, a forensics hash‐based tampering detection and localization approach is proposed for seam carving‐based video retargeting. It extracts the invariant Speeded‐up Robust Feature points from every spatiotemporal image to represent the matching surface, and the relative position change of the neighboring matching surface is used to build the forensic hash in a compact and scalable way. Experimental results show that the proposed forensics approach can effectively estimate the exact amount and rough locations of deleted seam carving surfaces. It achieves desirable detection performance even when there are frames deleted. If the hash length is reasonably increased, it can estimate the rough location and exact amount of deleted frames. Moreover, the built forensics hash is of good robustness, scalability, and compactness. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

This letter proposes a machine learning based blocking artifacts metric for JPEG images by measuring the regularities of pseudo structures. Image corner, block boundary and color change properties are used to differentiate the blocking artifacts. A support vector regression (SVR) model is adopted to learn the underlying relations between these features and perceived blocking artifacts. The blocking artifacts score of a test image is predicted using the trained model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",

      "abstract": "This letter presents a Referenceless quality Measure of Blocking artifacts (RMB) using Tchebichef moments. It is based on the observation that Tchebichef kernels with different orders have varying abilities to capture blockiness. In a block manner, high-odd-order moments are computed to score the blocking artifacts. The blockiness scores are further weighted to incorporate the characteristic of Human Visual System (HVS), which is achieved by classifying the blocks into smooth and textured. Experimental results and comparisons demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Distributed video coding (DVC) is a coding paradigm that can shift the computational expensive task from the encoder to the decoder.Though in theory this reverse of encoder and decoder complexity does not cause coding performance degradation compared with traditional hybrid video codecs, the gap between the two codecs is still quite high.One reason for the performance gap is the lack of rich coding modes for current DVC codecs.This paper proposes a frame-based skip mode decision algorithm.An effective encoder-side SI quality estimation technique is introduced to facilitate an accurate skip mode decision.With the proposed technique, the encoding and decoding time are reduced by about 9% and 50% respectively and the rate-distortion (R-D) performance is improved by an average of 0.49 dB compared with the well-known DISCOVER DVC codec.",

The sign of the moment is considered and the relative difference of the moments is obtained by comparing the absolute moment difference (AMD) with the magnitude of the original moment. A new quality function is proposed, which is an exponential function of the relative moment difference (RMD). Simulation results show the efficiency of the method.",

      "abstract": "Region duplication is a common method to produce forgery images, where part of an image is copied and pasted somewhere else in the same image. In order to fit the scene better and leave no visible artifacts, the copied region may be processed by affine transforms before being pasted. Most of the existing methods cannot handle these transforms. This paper presents a method to detect the region-duplication forgery under affine transforms. The image is first filtered and divided into overlapping circular blocks. Then the normalized color histogram (NCH) is extracted as the block feature. Forgery detection is achieved by comparing the NCH features. A new filter is designed to process the initial detection results. The final detection map is obtained after morphological operations. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the method.",

However, it is hard to detect the tampered regions when they are rotated before being pasted. To solve the problem, this paper presents a novel approach for detecting region-duplication forgery with rotation. Polar Harmonic Transform (PHT) is employed to extract the features of the circular blocks, which are then used to perform block matching. Experimental results show that the proposed method is not only robust to added noise and JPEG compression, but also robust to object rotation. Simulation results demonstrate the performances of the proposed scheme.",

Visually salient region is introduced into watermark synchronization. The saliency value of a region is used as the quantitative measure of robustness, based on which the idea of locally most salient region (LMSR) is proposed to generate the disjoint invariant regions. A meaningful binary watermark is then encoded using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) in transform domain. Simulation results and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

The PSTs are easy to compute and have no numerical stability problem, thus are more suitable for watermarking. In the proposed method, the PSTs are modified according to the binary watermark bits, producing a compensation image. The watermarked image is obtained by adding the compensation image to the original image directly. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed scheme in terms of both watermark capacity and watermark robustness.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, a novel adaptive total variation (ATV) model is proposed for image inpainting. The classical TV model is a partial differential equation (PDE)-based technique. While the TV model can preserve the image edges well, it has some drawbacks, such as staircase effect in the inpainted image and slow convergence rate. By analyzing the diffusion mechanism of TV model and introducing a new edge detection operator named difference curvature, we propose a novel ATV inpainting model. The proposed ATV model can diffuse the image information smoothly and quickly, namely, this model not only eliminates the staircase effect but also accelerates the convergence rate. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

This paper studies LEACH protocol, and put an Improved LEACH protocol which has more reasonable set-up phase. In the cluster heads election phase, we put the energy ratio and competition distance as two elements to join the cluster head election. Simulation results demonstrate that Improved LEACH algorithm has better energy balance and prolong network lifetime.",

      "abstract": "Image completion is an important task in the field of image processing with broad applications in image and vision analysis. we consider the image completion problem arising in image restoration: part of an image has been removed, and we want to restore the image from the remaining, possibly noisy, portion. In this paper, we present a new approach based on exemplar-based completion model which combines the characters of in painting and texture synthesis. Firstly we decide the size of image template based on the gradient domain of the image. Secondly, the filling priority of the template is determined by the curvature of the level lines and the confidence item of the template. This is also interpreted by total variation (TV) method of partial differential equation (PDE). Because of considering the geometrical property of the level lines, the structure property of the image is preserved. Thirdly because of the gradient domain denoting the property of the texture, when comparing the similarity between the source template and destination template, not only we compute the sum of squared differences (SSD) of the all ready filled pixels but also combining the information of the gradient domain of the templates. Lastly we copy the determined source template to the destination template and update the information of the destination template. Some experiments will show the advantage of our method.",

The watermark embedding positions are first determined by the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) based local circular regions. Then the binary watermark image is embedded by quantization in the Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) domain. In order to achieve rotation invariance, the watermark is embedded adaptively to the orientation of the region. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve high invisibility and it can efficiently resist traditional signal processing attacks and geometric attacks.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a new robust image watermarking scheme for resisting both traditional and geometric attacks. A watermark synchronization scheme is first presented using image features. Harris interest points are first extracted from the scale normalized image and the locally most stable points are employed to generate some non-overlapped circular regions. Watermark synchronization is achieved using these local circular regions. Thereafter, the rotation invariant pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs) are computed over each circular region and the watermark signal is composed of the PZM vectors extracted from all the local regions. Then the PZM vectors are modified and reconstructed, producing some error images. The watermark is embedded by adding the error images into the corresponding local circular regions in spatial domain directly. During watermark detection, local circular regions are first extracted from the distorted image and PZMs are computed over each local region. A minimum distance decoder is proposed to detect the watermark blindly. Simulation results on Stirmark 4.0 show that the watermark is robust against traditional signal processing attacks, rotation, scaling, flipping, Stirmark random bending as well as combined attacks.",

      "abstract": "A histogram based image watermarking algorithm is proposed based on the invariant property of the statistic characteristic of an image for resisting geometric attacks. During embedding, a particular range of pixel values is first selected and divided into intervals according to a predefined step. Then the pixels within each interval are quantized to have the same value according to the watermark bit. During watermark extraction, the pixel values are divided into intervals using the same method as watermark embedding. A watermark bit can be extracted from each interval. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust to rotation, scaling and cropping attacks, as well as some signal processing attacks.",

The proposed two schemes embed the watermark by quantizing the high-frequency and low-frequency DTCWT coefficients, respectively. In our schemes, the watermark capacity can be more than 1000 bits.

      "abstract": "This letter presents a novel robust video watermarking scheme based on space-time interest points. These points correspond to inherent structures of the video so that they can be used as synchronization signals for watermark embedding and extraction. In the proposed scheme, local regions are generated using the space-time interest points, and the watermark is embedded into all the regions by quantization. It is a blind scheme and the watermark can be extracted from any position of the video. Experimental results show that the watermark is invisible and it can robustly survive traditional signal processing attacks and video-oriented attacks.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel robust image watermarking scheme for resisting geometric attacks. In the proposed scheme, watermark synchronization is first achieved by the local circular regions, which can be generated using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). Then the watermark is embedded into each local region in spatial domain by odd-even quantization. In the decoder, the watermark can be extracted using the proposed odd-even detector. Simulations and comparisons have demonstrated the effectiveness of our scheme.",

      "abstract": "A new video watermarking scheme is presented based on Krawtchouk moments(KVW).The ′localness′ property of Krawtchouk moments(KMs) permits the watermark to be inserted locally at a certain object region selected by the user.KVW first computes KMs of I frame and the adjacent P frame after selecting the same most significant object region.The robustness to the cropping of lower KMs and high similarity between video frames are combined to select an optimal moment set.The moments in the optimal moment set are modified according to the random watermark bits.The difference vector is reconstructed and added to I frame in spatial domain to obtain the watermarked I frame.In detection,the KMs of the possibly attacked I frame are computed.And the KMs of original I frame are substitued by the adjacent KMs of P frame selected in the optimal moment set as the key to extract watermark bits.Extensive simulation results show that KVW achieves good image quality and it is robust to frame cropping and common signal processing attacks.",

As SIFT features are invariant to rotation and scaling, we employ SIFT to extract feature points. Then circular patches are generated using the most robust points. An invariant watermark is generated from each circular patch based on Zernike moments. The watermark is embedded into multiple patches for resisting locally cropping attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust to both geometric attacks and signal processing attacks.",

During the modulation, a theorem deduced from the texture features and energy modulation model is employed to restrict the modified magnitude of coefficients. This system is of large data payload and high computational efficiency, and is capable of embedding 8192 bits of information in images with dimensions 512×512 pixels. Experimental results indicate that the presented scheme is transparent and robust to significant volumetric distortions (including additive noise,low-pass filtering and lossy compression) and a part of geometric distortions.",
