    "trend_summary": "Hongxun Yao's research spans over two decades, evolving from foundational work in affective image analysis and facial expression recognition (2002–2015) toward increasingly sophisticated, human-centered, and cognitively grounded paradigms. Early contributions pioneered probabilistic, sparse, and distributional modeling of subjective image emotions; later work expanded into multimodal fusion (speech, image, video, social context), adaptive and dynamic emotion modeling, and robust learning under data scarcity. Recent directions (2024–2025) emphasize cross-domain generalization (e.g., CLIP-based and prompt-guided emotion adaptation), disentangled and interpretable representations (e.g., via information bottleneck and fuzzy systems), and emotion-aware generative modeling — all unified by a strong commitment to psychological plausibility, user subjectivity, and real-world applicability in social media, multimedia, and HCI.",

      "abstract": "Mamba and its variants excel at modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity, making them effective for diverse vision tasks. However, Mamba's reliance on unfolding 1D sequential representations necessitates multiple directional scans to recover lost spatial dependencies. This introduces significant computational overhead, redundant token traversal, and inefficiencies that compromise accuracy in real-world applications. To this end, we propose PH-Mamba, a novel framework integrating position encoding and harmonized attention for image deraining and beyond. PH-Mamba transforms Mamba's scanning process into a position-guided, unidirectional scanning that selectively prioritizes degradation-relevant tokens. Specifically, we devise a position-guided hybrid Mamba module (PHMM) that jointly encodes perturbation features alongside their spatial coordinates and harmonized representation to model consistent degradation patterns. Within PHMM, a harmonized Transformer is developed to focus on uncertain regions while suppressing noise interference, thereby improving spatial modeling fidelity. Additionally, we employ a vector decomposition and synthesis strategy to enable the unified representation layout to global degradation by directional scanning while minimizing redundancy. By cascading multiple PHMM blocks, PH-Mamba combines global positional guidance with local differential features to strengthen contextual learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PH-Mamba across low-level image restoration benchmarks. For example, compared to NeRD, PH-Mamba achieves a 0.60 dB PSNR improvement while requiring 88.9% fewer parameters, 36.2% less computation, and 63.0% faster inference time.",

      "abstract": "Visual emotion recognition (VER), which aims to understand human emotional reactions to different visual stimuli, has garnered increasing attention. However, the inherent ambiguity of emotional features presents significant challenges for data annotation in supervised learning paradigms. To address this limitation, emotion domain adaptation (EDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains. Recently, large visual-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive transfer performance on traditional UDA tasks. However, when generalizing to more abstract concepts such as emotion, the misalignment between CLIP and emotion spaces greatly affects the model performance. To address these challenges, we propose a CLIP-based emotion disentanglement (EmoD) framework designed for EDA. Leveraging perspectives from information bottleneck theory, EmoD implements a disentangler network that extracts emotion-specific features while removing redundant emotion-agnostic information. It also incorporates cross-domain feature alignment to reduce the affective gap between domains. Experimental evaluations in six EDA settings demonstrate that EmoD achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing traditional CLIP-based UDA methods by an average of 2.53%.",

Taking full account of the fast convergence characteristics of prescribed-time theory and the stability and realizability of the Extended State Observer (ESO) in nonlinear disturbance estimation, this paper integrates the two by introducing bounded time-varying gains. This approach solves the spike problem of traditional ESO at the initial moment and extends the applicability of prescribed-time theory to the full time interval, effectively enhancing the real-time performance and accuracy of disturbance estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.",

      "abstract": "Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

However, existing methods struggle to balance fine-grained detail preservation with temporal consistency. This limitation results in artifacts like flickering and unrealistic deformations, especially in facial and hand regions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamAnimate, a novel framework that synthesizes temporally consistent and detail-rich animations. DreamAnimate integrates three modules: the Progressive Motion Estimation module ensures accurate motion alignment and temporal stability by refining keypoint heatmaps, the Global Affine Transformation module generates dense motion flows to handle complex motions and occlusions, and the Character Animation Fusion module combines intermediate synthesis using a UNet architecture and an Animation Fusion Network to produce high-quality animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamAnimate outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior fidelity and effectively capturing intricate facial expressions and hand movements. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/cslltian/DreamAnimate in the near future.",

      "abstract": "Multi-instance learning (MIL) has demonstrated impressive performance in whole slide image (WSI) analysis. However, existing approaches struggle with undesirable results and unbearable computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has offered a feasible solution for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity. However, vanilla Mamba inherently suffers from contextual forgetting issues, making it ill-suited for capturing global dependencies across instances in large-scale WSIs. To address this, we propose a memory-driven Mamba network, dubbed M3amba, to fully explore the global latent relations among instances. Specifically, M3amba retains and iteratively updates historical information with a dynamic memory bank (DMB), thus overcoming the catastrophic forgetting defects of Mamba for long-term context representation. For better feature representation, M3amba involves an intra-group bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) block to refine local interactions within groups. Meanwhile, we additionally perform cross-attention fusion to incorporate relevant historical information across groups, facilitating richer inter-group connections. The joint learning of inter- and intra-group representations with memory merits enables M3amba with a more powerful capability for achieving accurate and comprehensive WSI representation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that M3amba outperforms the state-of-the-art by 6.2% and 7.0% in accuracy on the TCGA BRCA and TCGA Lung datasets while maintaining low computational costs.",

      "abstract": "Bag-label-based multi-instance learning (MIL) has demonstrated significant performance in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, particularly in pseudo-label-based learning schemes. However, due to inaccurate feature representation and interference, existing MIL methods often yield unreliable pseudo-labels, which spawn undesired predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Online Pseudo-Supervision and Dynamic Mutual Learning (OODML) framework that enhances pseudo-label generation and feature representation while exploring their mutual learning to improve bag-level prediction. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Memory Bank (AMB) to collect the most informative components of the current WSI. We also introduce a Self-Progressive Feature Fusion (SPFF) module that integrates label-related historical information from the AMB with current semantic variations, thereby enhancing the representation of pseudo-bag tokens. Furthermore, we propose a Decision Revision Pseudo-Label (DRPL) generation scheme to explore intrinsic connections between pseudo-bag representations and bag-label predictions, resulting in more reliable pseudo-label generation. To alleviate redundant and ambiguous representations, the class-wise prior of pseudo-label prediction is borrowed to facilitate label-related feature learning and to update the AMB, forming a mutual refinement between feature representation and pseudo-label generation. Additionally, a Dynamic Decision-Making (DDM) module is developed to harmonize explicit and implicit representations of bag information for more robust decision-making. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our OODML surpasses the state-of-the-art by 3.3% and 6.9% on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung datasets.",

      "abstract": "Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) aims to identify emotions from visual content and has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications. Although deep learning-based methods have shown success in VER, they require extensive labeled data, which is costly. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods can reduce reliance on annotated data by transferring models trained on labeled datasets to unlabeled data. However, these methods assume that the source and target domains share the same label space. In practice, this assumption is often violated due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity in emotion labeling. To address this limitation, we propose a novel prompt learning paradigm for open-vocabulary visual emotion UDA, termed Domain-specific Ensemble Prompting (DSEP). DSEP leverages psychological emotion models to unify emotion labels into a common space in an ensemble manner, enhancing the open-vocabulary capabilities of UDA. It then combines ensemble label prompts with domain-specific content prompts to achieve open-vocabulary UDA. To our knowledge, we are the first to explore open-vocabulary adaptation for VER. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four public benchmarks.",

Current prompt-tuning methods primarily optimize on general datasets, yet their application in biological datasets remains limited due to the field’s specificity. To address this gap, we introduce Multimodal and Multiple Prompts for Biology (MMPB). Our approach incorporates a Vision Prompt Injection module, which injects diverse biological visual information from the vision branch into the language branch. Additionally, we propose a multiple prompts scheme tailored to the fine-grained naming conventions in biology. We assess the method’s effectiveness on generation to novel classes, and results demonstrate that MMPB significantly outperforms existing approaches across eight biological datasets. Specifically, MMPB achieves a 14.90% absolute improvement in novel classes performance and an 11.71% gain in harmonic mean compared to the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Successful video deblurring relies on effectively using sharp pixels from other frames to recover the blurry pixels of the current frame. However, mainstream methods only use estimated optical flows to align and fuse features from adjacent frames without considering the pixel-wise blur levels, leading to the introduction of blurry pixels from adjacent frames. Furthermore, these methods fail to effectively exploit information from the entire input video. To address these limitations, we propose STDANet++, which redesigns the state-of-the-art method STDANet by introducing patch-based spatio-temporal deformable attention (PSTDA) module and long-term frame fusion (LTFF) module to the BiRNN-based structure. By effectively utilizing sharp information across the entire video, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro, DVD and BSD datasets, according to our experimental results.

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of supervised ML heavily depends on having a large, accurate, and diverse annotated dataset, which poses a challenge in applying ML for yield prediction. To address this issue, we developed a self-training random forest algorithm capable of automatically expanding the annotated dataset. Specifically, we trained a random forest regressor model using a small amount of annotated data. This model was then utilized to generate new annotations, thereby automatically extending the training dataset through self-training. Our experiments involved collecting data from over 30 winter wheat varieties during the 2019–2020 and 2021–2022 growing seasons. The testing results indicated that our model achieved an R2 of 0.84, RMSE of 627.94 kg/ha, and MAE of 516.94 kg/ha in the test dataset, while the validation dataset yielded an R2 of 0.81, RMSE of 692.96 kg/ha, and MAE of 550.62 kg/ha. In comparison, the standard random forest resulted in an R2 of 0.81, RMSE of 681.02 kg/ha, and MAE of 568.97 kg/ha in the test dataset, with validation results of an R2 of 0.79, RMSE of 736.24 kg/ha, and MAE of 585.85 kg/ha. Overall, these results demonstrate that our self-training random forest algorithm is a practical and effective solution for expanding annotated datasets, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of ML models in winter wheat yield forecasting.",

      "abstract": "The ability to animate photo-realistic head avatars reconstructed from monocular portrait video sequences represents a crucial step in bridging the gap between the virtual and real worlds. Recent advancements in head avatar techniques, including explicit 3D morphable meshes (3DMM), point clouds, and neural implicit representation have been exploited for this ongoing research. However, 3DMM-based methods are constrained by their fixed topologies, point-based approaches suffer from a heavy training burden due to the extensive quantity of points involved, and the last ones suffer from limitations in deformation flexibility and rendering efficiency. In response to these challenges, we propose MonoGaussianAvatar (Monocular Gaussian Point-based Head Avatar), a novel approach that harnesses 3D Gaussian point representation coupled with a Gaussian deformation field to learn explicit head avatars from monocular portrait videos. We define our head avatars with Gaussian points characterized by adaptable shapes, enabling flexible topology. These points exhibit movement with a Gaussian deformation field in alignment with the target pose and expression of a person, facilitating efficient deformation. Additionally, the Gaussian points have controllable shape, size, color, and opacity combined with Gaussian splatting, allowing for efficient training and rendering. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art results among previous methods.

      "abstract": "Video deblurring relies on leveraging information from other frames in the video sequence to restore the blurred regions in the current frame. Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal Transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose BSSTNet, Blur-aware Spatio-temporal Sparse Transformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, lever-aging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps, which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet out-performs the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.",

      "abstract": "Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) has shown impressive performance for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis using bags or pseudo-bags. It involves instance sampling, feature representation, and decision-making. However, existing MIL-based technologies at least suffer from one or more of the following problems: 1) requiring high storage and intensive pre-processing for numerous instances (sampling); 2) potential over-fitting with limited knowledge to predict bag labels (feature representation); 3) pseudo-bag counts and prior biases affect model robustness and generalizability (decision-making). Inspired by clinical diagnostics, using the past sampling instances can facilitate the final WSI analysis, but it is barely explored in prior technologies. To break free these limitations, we integrate the dynamic instance sampling and reinforcement learning into a unified framework to improve the instance selection and feature aggregation, forming a novel Dynamic Policy Instance Selection (DPIS) scheme for better and more credible decision-making. Specifically, the measurement of feature distance and reward function are employed to boost continuous instance sampling. To alleviate the over-fitting, we explore the latent global relations among instances for more robust and discriminative feature representation while establishing reward and punishment mechanisms to correct biases in pseudo-bags using contrastive learning. These strategies form the final Dynamic Policy-Driven Adaptive Multi-Instance Learning (PAMIL) method for WSI tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that our PAMIL method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.8\\% on CAMELYON16 and 4.4\\% on TCGA lung cancer datasets.",

      "abstract": "Although stereo image restoration has been extensively studied, most existing work focuses on restoring stereo images with limited horizontal parallax due to the binocular symmetry constraint. Stereo images with unlimited parallax (e.g., large ranges and asymmetrical types) are more challenging in real-world applications and have rarely been explored so far. To restore high-quality stereo images with unlimited parallax, this paper proposes an attention-guided correspondence learning method, which learns both self- and cross-views feature correspondence guided by parallax and omnidirectional attention. To learn cross-view feature correspondence, a Selective Parallax Attention Module (SPAM) is proposed to interact with cross-view features under the guidance of parallax attention that adaptively selects receptive fields for different parallax ranges. Furthermore, to handle asymmetrical parallax, we propose a Non-local Omnidirectional Attention Module (NOAM) to learn the non-local correlation of both self- and cross-view contexts, which guides the aggregation of global contextual features. Finally, we propose an Attention-guided Correspondence Learning Restoration Network (ACLRNet) upon SPAMs and NOAMs to restore stereo images by associating the features of two views based on the learned correspondence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method on three stereo image restoration tasks including super-resolution, denoising, and compression artifact reduction.",

      "abstract": "Human instance matting aims to estimate an alpha matte for each human\\ninstance in an image, which is extremely challenging and has rarely been\\nstudied so far. Despite some efforts to use instance segmentation to generate a\\ntrimap for each instance and apply trimap-based matting methods, the resulting\\nalpha mattes are often inaccurate due to inaccurate segmentation. In addition,\\nthis approach is computationally inefficient due to multiple executions of the\\nmatting method. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel\\nEnd-to-End Human Instance Matting (E2E-HIM) framework for simultaneous multiple\\ninstance matting in a more efficient manner. Specifically, a general perception\\nnetwork first extracts image features and decodes instance contexts into latent\\ncodes. Then, a united guidance network exploits spatial attention and semantics\\nembedding to generate united semantics guidance, which encodes the locations\\nand semantic correspondences of all instances. Finally, an instance matting\\nnetwork decodes the image features and united semantics guidance to predict all\\ninstance-level alpha mattes. In addition, we construct a large-scale human\\ninstance matting dataset (HIM-100K) comprising over 100,000 human images with\\ninstance alpha matte labels. Experiments on HIM-100K demonstrate the proposed\\nE2E-HIM outperforms the existing methods on human instance matting with 50%\\nlower errors and 5X faster speed (6 instances in a 640X640 image). Experiments\\non the PPM-100, RWP-636, and P3M datasets demonstrate that E2E-HIM also\\nachieves competitive performance on traditional human matting.\\n",

      "abstract": "Music-oriented dance choreography is a complex art form that requires consideration of various factors in music understanding and physical aesthetics. In addition, learning model to generate dance sequences automatically needs to overcome not only the challenges from choreography but also the complexity of human skeleton structure. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional GRU (GraphGRU) model for music-oriented dance choreography by integrating the graph convolutional networks into the gated recurrent unit. The GraphGRU can model the spatial relationship among the human skeleton joints and the temporal relationship of the dancing sequences. Besides, we define multiple dance-driven kinematic graphs for GraphGRU and establish a path attention block to fuse the graph features. Moreover, we design a reverse-generation loss to ensure consistency between the generated dance and the music. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model GraphGRU can effectively solve the task of dance choreography.",

      "abstract": "Image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer an in-shop clothing image to a person image. Most existing methods adopt a single global deformation to perform clothing warping directly, which lacks fine-grained modeling of in-shop clothing and leads to distorted clothing appearance. In addition, existing methods usually fail to generate limb details well because they are limited by the used clothing-agnostic person representation without referring to the limb textures of the person image. To address these problems, we propose Limb-aware Virtual Try-on Network named PL-VTON, which performs fine-grained clothing warping progressively and generates high-quality try-on results with realistic limb details. Specifically, we present Progressive Clothing Warping (PCW) that explicitly models the location and size of in-shop clothing and utilizes a two-stage alignment strategy to progressively align the in-shop clothing with the human body. Moreover, a novel gravity-aware loss that considers the fit of the person wearing clothing is adopted to better handle the clothing edges. Then, we design Person Parsing Estimator (PPE) with a non-limb target parsing map to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and body regions. Finally, we introduce Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) that focuses on generating realistic details in limb regions, where a coarse try-on result is first generated by fusing the warped clothing image with the person image, then limb textures are further fused with the coarse result under limb-aware guidance to refine limb details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PL-VTON outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

      "abstract": "As one of the most fundamental techniques in multi-modal learning, cross-modal matching aims to project various sensory modalities into a shared feature space. To achieve this, massive and correctly aligned data pairs are required for model training. However, unlike unimodal datasets, multimodal datasets are extremely harder to collect and annotate precisely. As an alternative, the co-occurred data pairs (e.g., image-text pairs) collected from the Internet have been widely exploited in the area. Unfortunately, the cheaply collected dataset unavoidably contains many mismatched data pairs, which have been proven to be harmful to the model's performance. To address this, we propose a general framework called BiCro (Bidirectional Cross-modal similarity consistency), which can be easily integrated into existing cross-modal matching models and improve their robustness against noisy data. Specifically, BiCro aims to estimate soft labels for noisy data pairs to reflect their true correspondence degree. The basic idea of BiCro is motivated by that – taking image-text matching as an example – similar images should have similar textual descriptions and vice versa. Then the consistency of these two similarities can be recast as the estimated soft labels to train the matching model. The experiments on three popular cross-modal matching datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the noise-robustness of various matching models, and surpass the state-of-the-art by a clear margin. The code is available at https://github.com/xu5zhao/BiCro.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid models which combine the convolution and transformer model achieve impressive performance on human pose estimation. However, the existing hybrid models on human pose estimation, which typically stack self-attention modules after convolution, are prone to mutual conflict. The mutual conflict enforces one type of module to dominate over these hybrid sequential models. Consequently, the performance of higher-precision keypoints localization is not consistent with overall performance. To alleviate this mutual conflict, we developed a hybrid parallel network by parallelizing the self-attention modules and the convolution modules, which conduce to leverage the complementary capabilities effectively. The parallel network ensures that the self-attention branch tends to model the long-range dependency to enhance the semantic representation, whereas the local sensitivity of the convolution branch contributes to high-precision localization simultaneously. To further mitigate the conflict, we proposed a cross-branches attention module to gate the features generated by both branches along the channel dimension. The hybrid parallel network achieves 75.6% and 75.4%AP on COCO validation and test-dev sets and achieves consistent performance on both higher-precision localization and overall performance. The experiments show that our hybrid parallel network is on par with the state-of-the-art human pose estimation models.",

      "abstract": "Deepfake technique can synthesize realistic images, audios, and videos, facilitating the thriving of entertainment, education, healthcare, and other industries. However, its abuse may pose potential threats to personal privacy, social stability, and even national security. Therefore, the development of deepfake detection methods is attracting more and more attention. Existing works mainly focus on the detection of common videos for entertainment purposes. In contrast, fake videos maliciously synthesized for Person of Interest (PoI, i.e., who is in an authoritative position and has broadly public influences) are much more harmful to society because of celebrity endorsement. However, there is no particular benchmark for driving related research in the community. Motivated by this observation, we present the first large-scale benchmark dataset, named FakePoI, to enable the research on fake PoI detection. It contains numerous fake videos of important people from all walks of life, e.g., police chiefs, city mayors, famous artists, and well-known Internet bloggers. In summary, our FakePoI includes 11092 synthesized videos where only a few clips rather than the entire are fake. Previous fake detection algorithms deteriorate heavily or even fail on our FakePoI due to two main challenges. On the one hand, the rich diversity of our fake videos makes it pretty difficult to find universally applicable patterns for detection. On the other hand, the high credibility contributed by the presence of real frames easily confuses a common detector. To tackle these challenges, we present an amplifier framework, highlighting the feature gap between real and generated video frames. Specifically, we present a quadruplet loss to narrow the distance of all real PoIs and meanwhile push away each real and fake PoI in embedding space. We implement our framework and conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark. The quantitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods significantly, setting a strong baseline on FakePoI. The qualitative analysis also shows its superiority. We will release our dataset and code at <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/cslltian/deepfake-detection</uri> to encourage future research on this valuable area.",

      "abstract": "Existing low-light video enhancement methods are dominated by Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are trained in a supervised manner. Due to the difficulty of collecting paired dynamic low/normal-light videos in real-world scenes, they are usually trained on synthetic, static, and uniform motion videos, which undermines their generalization to real-world scenes. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from temporal inconsistency (e.g., flickering artifacts and motion blurs) when handling large-scale motions since the local perception property of CNNs limits them to model long-range dependencies in both spatial and temporal domains. To address these problems, we propose the first unsupervised method for low-light video enhancement to our best knowledge, named LightenFormer, which models long-range intra- and inter-frame dependencies with a spatial-temporal co-attention transformer to enhance brightness while maintaining temporal consistency. Specifically, an effective but lightweight S-curve Estimation Network (SCENet) is first proposed to estimate pixel-wise S-shaped non-linear curves (S-curves) to adaptively adjust the dynamic range of an input video. Next, to model the temporal consistency of the video, we present a Spatial-Temporal Refinement Network (STRNet) to refine the enhanced video. The core module of STRNet is a novel Spatial-Temporal Co-attention Transformer (STCAT), which exploits multi-scale self- and cross-attention interactions to capture long-range correlations in both spatial and temporal domains among frames for implicit motion estimation. To achieve unsupervised training, we further propose two non-reference loss functions based on the invertibility of the S-curve and the noise independence among frames. Extensive experiments on the SDSD and LLIV-Phone datasets demonstrate that our LightenFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged recently as art self-supervised spatiotemporal representation learners. Inheriting from the image counterparts, however, existing video MAEs still focus largely on static appearance learning whilst are limited in learning dynamic temporal information hence less effective for video downstream tasks. To resolve this drawback, in this work we present a motion-aware variant -- MotionMAE. Apart from learning to reconstruct individual masked patches of video frames, our model is designed to additionally predict the corresponding motion structure information over time. This motion information is available at the temporal difference of nearby frames. As a result, our model can extract effectively both static appearance and dynamic motion spontaneously, leading to superior spatiotemporal representation learning capability. Extensive experiments show that our MotionMAE outperforms significantly both supervised learning baseline and state-of-the-art MAE alternatives, under both domain-specific and domain-generic pretraining-then-finetuning settings. In particular, when using ViT-B as the backbone our MotionMAE surpasses the prior art model by a margin of 1.2% on Something-Something V2 and 3.2% on UCF101 in domain-specific pretraining setting. Encouragingly, it also surpasses the competing MAEs by a large margin of over 3% on the challenging video object segmentation task. The code is available at https://github.com/happy-hsy/MotionMAE.",

      "abstract": "Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) is a challenging task that aims to locate action instances in untrimmed videos with temporal boundaries. To evaluate the confidence of proposals, the existing works typically predict action score of proposals that are supervised by the temporal Intersection-over-Union (tIoU) between proposal and the ground-truth. In this paper, we innovatively propose a general auxiliary Background Constraint idea to further suppress low-quality proposals, by utilizing the background prediction score to restrict the confidence of proposals. In this way, the Background Constraint concept can be easily plug-and-played into existing TAPG methods (BMN, GTAD). From this perspective, we propose the Background Constraint Network (BCNet) to further take advantage of the rich information of action and background. Specifically, we introduce an Action-Background Interaction module for reliable confidence evaluation, which models the inconsistency between action and background by attention mechanisms at the frame and clip levels. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular benchmarks, ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Equipped with the existing action classifier, our method also achieves remarkable performance on the temporal action localization task.",

      "abstract": "Yield prediction is of great significance in agricultural production. Remote sensing technology based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers the capacity of non-intrusive crop yield prediction with low cost and high throughput. In this study, a winter wheat field experiment with three levels of irrigation (T1 = 240 mm, T2 = 190 mm, T3 = 145 mm) was conducted in Henan province. Multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy water stress indices (CWSI) were obtained using an UAV equipped with multispectral and thermal infrared cameras. A framework combining a long short-term memory neural network and random forest (LSTM-RF) was proposed for predicting wheat yield using VIs and CWSI from multi-growth stages as predictors. Validation results showed that the R2 of 0.61 and the RMSE value of 878.98 kg/ha was achieved in predicting grain yield using LSTM. LSTM-RF model obtained better prediction results compared to the LSTM with n R2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 684.1 kg/ha, which is equivalent to a 22% reduction in RMSE. The results showed that LSTM-RF considered both the time-series characteristics of the winter wheat growth process and the non-linear characteristics between remote sensing data and crop yield data, providing an alternative for accurate yield prediction in modern agricultural management.",

In this paper, we investigate the vertical flipping associated with visual chirality in freehand sketches. Our analysis of investigation results reveals that the vertical flipping shows a high degree of visual chirality. To utilize the high-level cues automatically discovered by predicting the vertical flipping, we propose a Visual Chirality Attention (VCA) module for deep CNNs, which consists of two sequential sub-modules: channel and chirality attention. Experimental results of sketch recognition on TU-Berlin dataset show that our method performs more favorably against state-of-the-art attention-based methods. Our code can be found at https://github.com/zhengyinghit/VCANet.",

      "abstract": "Recently, several Space-Time Memory based networks have shown that the object cues (e.g. video frames as well as the segmented object masks) from the past frames are useful for segmenting objects in the current frame. However, these methods exploit the information from the memory by global-to-global matching between the current and past frames, which lead to mismatching to similar objects and high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel local-to-local matching solution for semi-supervised VOS, namely Regional Memory Network (RMNet). In RMNet, the precise regional memory is constructed by memorizing local regions where the target objects appear in the past frames. For the current query frame, the query regions are tracked and predicted based on the optical flow estimated from the previous frame. The proposed local-to-local matching effectively alleviates the ambiguity of similar objects in both memory and query frames, which allows the information to be passed from the regional memory to the query region efficiently and effectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed RM-Net performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets.",

      "abstract": "Online hashing for streaming data has attracted increasing attention recently. However, most existing algorithms focus on batch inputs and instance-balanced optimization, which is limited in the single datum input case and does not match the dynamic training in online hashing. Furthermore, constantly updating the online model with new-coming samples will inevitably lead to the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel online hashing method to handle the above-mentioned issues jointly, termed Asynchronus Teacher-Guided Bit-wise Hard Mining for Online Hashing. Firstly, to meet the needs of datum-wise online hashing, we design a novel binary codebook that is discriminative to separate different classes. Secondly, we propose a novel semantic loss (termed bit-wise attention loss) to dynamically focus on hard samples of each bit during training. Last but not least, we design a asynchronous knowledge distillation scheme to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem, where the teacher model is delaying updated to maintain the old knowledge, guiding the student model learning. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmarks demonstrate the favorable performance of our method over the state-of-the-arts.",

      "abstract": "Multi-scale feature representation is a common strategy to handle the scale variation in pedestrian detection. Existing methods simply utilize the convolutional pyramidal features for multi-scale representation. However, they rarely pay attention to the differences among different feature scales and extract multi-scale features from a single feature map, which may make the detectors sensitive to scale-variance in multi-scale pedestrian detection. In this paper, we introduce a bidirectional feature enhancement module (BFEM) to augment the semantic information of low-level features and the localization information of high-level features. In addition, we propose a prior-based receptive field block (PRFB) for multi-scale pedestrian feature extraction, where the receptive field is closer to the aspect ratio of the pedestrian target. Consequently, it is less affected by the surrounding background when extracting features. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the CityPersons and Caltech datasets.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, supervised hashing has been validated to greatly boost the performance of image retrieval. However, the label-hungry property requires massive label collection, making it intractable in practical scenarios. To liberate the model training procedure from laborious manual annotations, some unsupervised methods are proposed. However, the following two factors make unsupervised algorithms inferior to their supervised counterparts: (1) Without manually-defined labels, it is difficult to capture the semantic information across data, which is of crucial importance to guide robust binary code learning. (2) The widely adopted relaxation on binary constraints results in quantization error accumulation in the optimization procedure. To address the above-mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Unsupervised Discrete Hashing method (UDH). Specifically, to capture the semantic information, we propose a balanced graph-based semantic loss which explores the affinity priors in the original feature space. Then, we propose a novel self-supervised loss, termed orthogonal consistent loss, which can leverage semantic loss of instance and impose independence of codes. Moreover, by integrating the discrete optimization into the proposed unsupervised framework, the binary constraints are consistently preserved, alleviating the influence of quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDH outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for image retrieval.",

      "abstract": "Deep hashing methods have been proved to be effective and efficient for large-scale Web media search. The success of these data-driven methods largely depends on collecting sufficient labeled data, which is usually a crucial limitation in practical cases. The current solutions to this issue utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data in semi-supervised learning. However, existing GAN-based methods treat image generations and hashing learning as two isolated processes, leading to generation ineffectiveness. Besides, most works fail to exploit the semantic information in unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Self-pace Adversarial Hashing method, named SSAH to solve the above problems in a unified framework. The SSAH method consists of an adversarial network (A-Net) and a hashing network (H-Net). To improve the quality of generative images, first, the A-Net learns hard samples with multi-scale occlusions and multi-angle rotated deformations which compete against the learning of accurate hashing codes. Second, we design a novel self-paced hard generation policy to gradually increase the hashing difficulty of generated samples. To make use of the semantic information in unlabeled ones, we propose a semi-supervised consistent loss. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art models on both the widely-used hashing datasets and fine-grained datasets.",

      "abstract": "Scene text recognition with arbitrary shape is very challenging due to large variations in text shapes, fonts, colors, backgrounds, etc. Most state-of-the-art algorithms rectify the input image into the normalized image, then treat the recognition as a sequence prediction task. The bottleneck of such methods is the rectification, which will cause errors due to distortion perspective. In this paper, we find that the rectification is completely unnecessary. What all we need is the spatial attention. We therefore propose a simple but extremely effective scene text recognition method based on transformer [50]. Different from previous transformer based models [56,34], which just use the decoder of the transformer to decode the convolutional attention, the proposed method use a convolutional feature maps as word embedding input into transformer. In such a way, our method is able to make full use of the powerful attention mechanism of the transformer. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a very large margin on both regular and irregular text datasets. On one of the most challenging CUTE dataset whose state-of-the-art prediction accuracy is 89.6%, our method achieves 99.3%, which is a pretty surprising result. We will release our source code and believe that our method will be a new benchmark of scene text recognition with arbitrary shapes.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel graph cut method for iterated segmentation of objects with specific shape bias (SBGC). In contrast with conventional graph cut models which emphasize the regional appearance only, the proposed SBGC takes the shape preference of the interested object into account to drive the segmentation. Therefore, the SBGC can ensure a more accurate convergence to the interested object even in complicated conditions where the appearance cues are inadequate for object/background discrimination. In particular, we firstly evaluate the segmentation by simultaneously considering its global shape and local edge consistencies with the object shape priors. Then these two cues are formulated into a graph cut framework to seek the optimal segmentation that maximizing both of the global and local measurements. By iteratively implementing the optimization, the proposed SBGC can achieve joint estimation of the optimal segmentation and the most likely object shape encoded by the shape priors, and eventually converge to the candidate result with maximum consistency between these two estimations. Finally, we take the ellipse shape objects with various segmentation challenges as examples for evaluation. Competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods validate the effectiveness of the technique.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, hashing methods have been proved to be effective and efficient for large-scale Web media search. However, the existing general hashing methods have limited discriminative power for describing fine-grained objects that share similar overall appearance but have a subtle difference. To solve this problem, we for the first time introduce the attention mechanism to the learning of fine-grained hashing codes. Specifically, we propose a novel deep hashing model, named deep saliency hashing (DSaH), which automatically mines salient regions and learns semantic-preserving hashing codes simultaneously. DSaH is a two-step end-to-end model consisting of an attention network and a hashing network. Our loss function contains three basic components, including the semantic loss, the saliency loss, and the quantization loss. As the core of DSaH, the saliency loss guides the attention network to mine discriminative regions from pairs of images.We conduct extensive experiments on both fine-grained and general retrieval datasets for performance evaluation. Experimental results on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford Flowers, Stanford Dogs, and CUB Birds demonstrate that our DSaH performs the best for the fine-grained retrieval task and beats the strongest competitor (DTQ) by approximately 10% on both Stanford Dogs and CUB Birds. DSaH is also comparable to several state-of-the-art hashing methods on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.",

      "abstract": "Under the tracking-by-detection framework, multi-object tracking methods try to connect object detections with target trajectories by reasonable policy. Most methods represent objects by the appearance and motion. The inference of the association is mostly judged by a fusion of appearance similarity and motion consistency. However, the fusion ratio between appearance and motion are often determined by subjective setting. In this paper, we propose a novel self-balance method fusing appearance similarity and motion consistency. Extensive experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with comparisons to several state-of-the-art trackers.",

      "abstract": "Body language is one of the most common ways of expressing human emotion. In this article, we make the first attempt to generate an action video with a specific emotion from a single person image. The goal of the emotion-based action generation task (EBAG) is to generate action videos expressing a specific type of emotion given a single reference image with a full human body. We divide the task into two parts and propose a two-stage framework to generate action videos with specified emotions. At the first stage, we propose an emotion-based pose sequence generation approach (EPOSE-GAN) for translating the emotion to a pose sequence. At the second stage, we generate the target video frames according to the three inputs including the source pose and the target pose as the motion information and the source image as the appearance reference by using conditional GAN model with an online training strategy. Our framework produces the pose sequence and transforms the action independently, which highlights the fundamental role that the high-level pose feature plays in generating action video with a specific emotion. The proposed method has been evaluated on the “Soul Dancer” dataset which is built for action emotion analysis and generation. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can effectively solve the emotion-based action generation task. However, the gap in the details of the appearance between the generated action video and the real-world video still exists, which indicates that the emotion-based action generation task has great research potential.",

      "abstract": "3-D object retrieval has been a hot research topic in recent years. Within such a field, view-based approaches are attracting increasing attention because of the flexibility of data representation as well as the reported state-of-the-art performance. One of the most important issues related to view-based 3-D object retrieval is how to learn embedding features that are discriminative across classes while being compactly distributed within each class. In this paper, we analyze the difference between the two tasks of classification and retrieval, and propose a novel way to learn a view-pooling feature via a triplet network. In addition, we propose a new loss, named cube loss, which is able to sample a number of triplets equal to the cube of the samples in a batch. With the new loss, both hard-negative and hard-positive pairs can be effectively investigated. The experimental results on the ModelNet benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep model for unbalanced distribution Character Recognition by employing focal loss based connectionist temporal classification (CTC) function. Previous works utilize Traditional CTC to compute prediction losses. However, some datasets may consist of extremely unbalanced samples, such as Chinese. In other words, both training and testing sets contain large amounts of low‐frequent samples. The low‐frequent samples have very limited influence on the model during training. To solve this issue, we modify the traditional CTC by fusing focal loss with it and thus make the model attend to the low‐frequent samples at training stage. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two types of datasets: synthetic and real image sequence datasets. The results on both datasets demonstrate that the proposed focal CTC loss function achieves desired performance on unbalanced datasets. Specifically, our method outperforms traditional CTC by 3 to 9 percentages in accuracy on average.",

      "abstract": "Image classification is a prominent topic and a challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Recently many various classification methods have been proposed for satellite images specifically the frameworks based on spectral-spatial feature extraction techniques. In this paper, a feature extraction strategy of multispectral data is taken into account in order to develop a new classification framework by combining Extended Multi-Attribute Profiles (EMAP) and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). Extended Multi-Attribute Profiles is employed to extract the spatial information, then it is joined to the original spectral information to describe the spectral-spatial property of the multispectral images. The obtained features are fed into a Sparse Autoencoder as input. Finally, the learned spectral-spatial features are embedded into the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Experiments are conducted on two multispectral (MS) images such as we construct the ground truth maps of the corresponding images. Our approach based on EMAP and deep learning (DL), proves its huge potential to achieve a high classification accuracy in reasonable running time and outperforms traditional classifiers and others classification approaches.",

Social multimedia is fundamentally changing how we communicate, interact, and collaborate with other people in our daily lives. Social multimedia contains much affective information. Effective extraction of affective information from social multimedia can greatly help social multimedia computing (e.g., processing, index, retrieval, and understanding). Besides, with the rapid development of digital photography and social networks, people get used to sharing their lives and expressing their opinions online. As a result, user-generated social media data, including text, images, audios, and videos, grow rapidly, which urgently demands advanced techniques on the management, retrieval, and understanding of these data.",

      "abstract": "This work aims to estimate dense correspondences between the images from same visual class but with different geometries and visual similarities. This task is particularly challenging because (i) most image pairs have large intra-class variations, and (ii)their visual content is similar only on the high-level structure. To address these problems, this paper proposed a multilevel method to estimate per-pixel correspondences from high-level semantic to low-level structural details by the guidance of cycle-consistency. We utilize CNN feature pyramid to represent images level by level. Meanwhile, we introduce cycle-consistency to measure the reliability of flow vector, which further affects the guidance from higher level to lower level. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on various challenging benchmarks. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of semantic flow accuracy.",

With the proposed regularization term, we learn a descriptor distribution in Euclidean space that aims at minimizing the overlap between the distributions of positive pairs and that of negative pairs. The proposed method is able to improve the performance of pairwise and triplet losses with various deep convolution network architectures. This improvement is demonstrated through two different types of architectures, able to obtain state-of-the-art results on the reference benchmark for local feature matching.",

      "abstract": "3D reconstruction has been attracting increasing attention in the past few years. With the surge of deep neural networks, the performance of 3D reconstruction has been improved significantly. However, the voxel reconstructed by extant approaches usually contains lots of noise and leads to heavy computation. In this paper, we define a new voxel representation, named Weighted Voxel. It provides more abundant information, facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps. Unlike regular voxel which consists of zero-one, the proposed Weighted Voxel makes full use of the structure information of voxels. Experimental results demonstrate that Weighted Voxel not only performs better in reconstruction but also takes less time in training.",

Instead of learning region-entity correspondences from explicitly human labelling, we collected weakly labeled Web images and proposed a method based on clustering to further discover image regions whose visual contents are highly correlated with the corresponding weak labels, from the original whole images. Then an adaptive visual representation is constructed from the discovered image regions which can automatically link phrase-image pairs. We also release a new dataset TVN25 targeting at Web-based travel notes visualization task which consists of 25 travel notes and over 22k weakly labeled Web images about the lingual phrases in travel notes. Experiments results on travel notes visualization not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework, but also show the potential for more real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "Very high resolution (VHR) image scene classification is the most challenging of remote sensing data analysis, that has attracted researchers' attention. To improve the precision of VHR image scene classification, we propose a new method based on convolutional features extracted by convolutional neural network (CNN). First, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG-Net) model is introduced as a feature extractor form the original VHR images. Second, we select the fifth convolutional layer constructed by VGG-Net, which is supposed as convolutional features descriptors. Third, based on Improved Fisher Vector (IFV) coding method, we compute the visual word corresponding to the convolutional features of the image scene. We conduct experiments on the public AID benchmark dataset, which contains 30 different areal categories with sub-meter resolution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Recognition of general actions has achieved great breakthroughs in recent years. However, in real-world applications, finer-grained action classification is often needed. The major challenge is that fine-grained actions usually share high similarities in both appearance and motion pattern, making it difficult to distinguish them with existing general action representation. To solve this problem, we introduce visual attention mechanism into the proposed descriptor, termed as Actionness-pooled Deep-convolutional Descriptor (ADD). Instead of pooling features uniformly from the entire video, we aggregate features in sub-regions that are more likely to contain actions according to actionness maps, which endow ADD with the capability of capturing the subtle differences between fine-grained actions. We conduct experiments on HIT Dances dataset, one of the few existing datasets for fine-grained action analysis. Quantitative results have demonstrated that ADD remarkably outperforms traditional two-stream representation. Extensive experiments on two general action benchmarks, JHMDB and UCF101, have additionally proved that combining ADD with end-to-end ConvNet can further boost the recognition performance.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to visual tracking with demonstrated success in recent years. Most CNN-based trackers utilize hierarchical features extracted from a certain layer to represent the target. However, features from a certain layer are not always effective for distinguishing the target object from the backgrounds especially in the presence of complicated interfering factors (e.g., heavy occlusion, background clutter, illumination variation, and shape deformation). In this work, we propose a CNN-based tracking algorithm which hedges deep features from different CNN layers to better distinguish target objects and background clutters. Correlation filters are applied to feature maps of each CNN layer to construct a weak tracker, and all weak trackers are hedged into a strong one. For robust visual tracking, we propose a hedge method to adaptively determine weights of weak classifiers by considering both the difference between the historical as well as instantaneous performance, and the difference among all weak trackers over time. In addition, we design a Siamese network to define the loss of each weak tracker for the proposed hedge method. Extensive experiments on large benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art tracking methods.",

      "abstract": "Computationally modelling the affective content of images has been extensively studied recently because of its wide applications in entertainment, advertisement, and education. Significant progress has been made on designing discriminative features to bridge the affective gap. Assuming that viewers can reach a consensus on the emotion of images, most existing works focused on assigning the dominant emotion category or the average dimension values to an image. However, the image emotions perceived by viewers are subjective by nature with the influence of personal and situational factors. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach that characterizes the categorical image emotions as a discrete probability distribution (DPD). To associate emotion with the visual features extracted from images, we present shared sparse learning to learn the combination coefficients, with which the DPD of an unseen image is predicted by linearly combining the DPDs of the training images. Furthermore, we extend our method to the setup where multi-features are available and learn the optimal weights for each feature to reflect the importance of different features. Extensive experiments are carried out on Abstract, Emotion6 and IESN datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "The satellite images with very high spatial resolution have been recently widely used in image classification topic as it has become challenging task in remote sensing field. Due to a number of limitations such as the redundancy of features and the high dimensionality of the data, different classification methods have been proposed for remote sensing images classification particularly the methods using feature extraction techniques. This paper propose a simple efficient method exploiting the capability of extended multi-attribute profiles (EMAP) with sparse autoencoder (SAE) for remote sensing image classification. The proposed method is used to classify various remote sensing datasets including hyperspectral and multispectral images by extracting spatial and spectral features based on the combination of EMAP and SAE by linking them to kernel support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Experiments on new hyperspectral image \"Huston data\" and multispectral image \"Washington DC data\" shows that this new scheme can achieve better performance of feature learning than the primitive features, traditional classifiers and ordinary autoencoder and has huge potential to achieve higher accuracy for classification in short running time.",

      "abstract": "Recently, visual tracking with RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data has attracted increasing interest. However, the depth data sometimes is incomplete, since the objects are beyond the distance limitation of sensors cannot be sampled. Traditional depth based features, such as objects shapes in depth image, are no longer effective in this case. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a depth enhancement method and introduce the divide and conquer idea into multi-target tracking. Firstly, we enhance the depth image by moving object detection, and then segment depth range into several small regions according to the depth range levels, which is discovered by our statistical model over depth data, so that the number of targets and interfering factors in each region is greatly reduced and hence the tracking in each region becomes much easier. Experimental results on a set of challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Part-based trackers are effective in exploiting local details of the target object for robust tracking. In contrast to most existing part-based methods that divide all kinds of target objects into a number of fixed rectangular patches, in this paper, we propose a novel framework in which a set of deformable patches dynamically collaborate on tracking of non-rigid objects. In particular, we proposed a shape-preserved kernelized correlation filter (SP-KCF) which can accommodate target shape information for robust tracking. The SP-KCF is introduced into the level set framework for dynamic tracking of individual patches. In this manner, our proposed deformable patches are target-dependent, have the capability to assume complex topology, and are deformable to adapt to target variations. As these deformable patches properly capture individual target subregions, we exploit their photometric discrimination and shape variation to reveal the trackability of individual target subregions, which enables the proposed tracker to dynamically take advantage of those subregions with good trackability for target likelihood estimation. Finally the shape information of these deformable patches enables accurate object contours to be computed as the tracking output. Experimental results on the latest public sets of challenging sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Most of the existing works on fine-grained bird image categorization and retrieval focus on finding similar images from the same species and often give little importance to inter-species similarity. In this paper, we devise a new fine-grained retrieval task that searches similar instances from different species. To this end, we propose a two-step strategy. In the first step, we search for visually similar parts to a query image using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). To improve the quality of the retrieved candidates, we incorporate structural cues into the CNN using a novel part-pooling layer. In the second step, we re-rank the retrieved candidates improving the species diversity. We achieve this by formulating a novel ranking function that balances between the similarity of the candidates to the queried parts, while decreasing the similarity to the query species. We provide experiments on the benchmark CUB200 dataset and demonstrate clear benefits of our schemes.",

AG has plenty of real-world applications such as sports training, rehabilitation treatment, and dance teaching. However, the problem of assessing the accuracy of action has almost no effective solution. In this paper, we describe a two-stage framework for action guidance. Firstly, we estimate the poses in the test video and standard video using person detection method and convolutional pose machines (CPMs). As for action guidance, we propose a network to compute the essential differences between two poses under different sizes, views, and locations. Extensive experiments with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

To tackle the large variations, we propose an algorithm to jointly estimate the dense correspondence for image set, which reformulates image set alignment into the problem of shortest path searching. We propose a novel tri-image cycle-consistency to measure the matching \"distance\" between two image, which is further used to improve the pair-wise dense correspondence. Meanwhile, we utilize CNN feature pyramid to achieve pair-wise image matching hierarchically. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the superiority of our method in matching images with challenging variations.",

      "abstract": "Context information plays an important role in object detection. DeepID concatenates the global context for classification, while Yolo, SSD, and Crafting use local context information for detection. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method to plug the global context information into the Faster RCNN Framework, namely the Skip Context Connection (SCC). We use SCC to inject the global context into the object representation which skips the RoiPooling layer rather than drops it. Therefore, it can not only leverage the context information but also keep the location accuracy from the RCNN framework. We proposed three principles to construct the SCC blocks: effectiveness means fewer parameters, additivity means the features possess the same meaning, and selectable means soft gated addition. We also evaluate several different SCC blocks. The Gated Additive SCC(GA-SCC) which satisfy the three principles get the best performance. Our experiment results on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that GA-SCC can get the steady 1% improvement over the traditional RCNN method.",

In this paper, we propose a new method for scene classification based on different pre-trained Deep Features Learning Models (DFLMs). DFLMs are applied simultaneously to extract deep features from the VHR image scene, and then different basic operators are applied for features combination extracted with different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. We conduct experiments on the public UC Merced benchmark dataset, which contains 21 different areal categories with sub-meter resolution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared to several state-of-the-art methods.",

MRIM has wide applications in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, medical and material science, especially in medical diagnosis. It is feasible to improve the resolution of MR imaging through increasing radiation intensity, but the high radiation intensity and the longtime of magnetic field harm the human body. Thus, in the practical applications the resolution of hardware imaging reaches the limitation of resolution. Software-based super-resolution technology is effective to improve the resolution of image. This work proposes a framework of dictionary-optimized sparse learning based MR super-resolution method. The framework is to solve the problem of sample selection for dictionary learning of sparse reconstruction. The textural complexity-based image quality representation is proposed to choose the optimal samples for dictionary learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the dictionary-optimized sparse learning improves the performance of sparse representation.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of remote sensing technology allows us to get images with high and very high resolution (VHR). VHR imagery scene classification has become an important and challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for VHR scene understanding. First, the pretrained visual geometry group network (VGG-Net) model is proposed as deep feature extractors to extract informative features from the original VHR images. Second, we select the fully connected layers constructed by VGG-Net in which each layer is regarded as separated feature descriptors. And then we combine between them to construct final representation of the VHR image scenes. Third, discriminant correlation analysis (DCA) is adopted as feature fusion strategy to further refine the original features extracting from VGG-Net, which allows a more efficient fusion approach with small cost than the traditional feature fusion strategies. We apply our approach to three challenging data sets: 1) UC MERCED data set that contains 21 different areal scene categories with submeter resolution; 2) WHU-RS data set that contains 19 challenging scene categories with various resolutions; and 3) the Aerial Image data set that has a number of 10 000 images within 30 challenging scene categories with various resolutions. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Using feature fusion technique achieves a higher accuracy than solely using the raw deep features. Moreover, the proposed method based on DCA fusion produces good informative features to describe the images scene with much lower dimension.",

      "abstract": "Dance is a unique and meaningful type of human expression, composed of abundant and various action elements. However, existing methods based on associated texts and spatial visual features have difficulty capturing the highly articulated motion patterns. To overcome this limitation, we propose to take advantage of the intrinsic motion information in dance videos to solve the video recommendation problem. We present a novel system that recommends dance videos based on a mid-level action representation, termed Dancelets. The Dancelets are used to bridge the semantic gap between video content and high-level concept, dance style, which plays a significant role in characterizing different types of dances. The proposed method executes automatic mining of dancelets with a concatenation of normalized cut clustering and linear discriminant analysis. This ensures that the discovered dancelets are both representative and discriminative. Additionally, to exploit the motion cues in videos, we employ motion boundaries as saliency priors to generate volumes of interest and extract C3D features to capture spatiotemporal information from the mid-level patches. Extensive experiments validated on our proposed large dance dataset, HIT Dances dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for dance style-based video recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Images can convey rich semantics and induce various emotions to viewers. Most existing works on affective image analysis focused on predicting the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. However, such dominant emotion is often insufficient in real-world applications, as the emotions that are induced by an image are highly subjective and different with respect to different viewers. In this paper, we propose to predict the personalized emotion perceptions of images for each individual viewer. Different types of factors that may affect personalized image emotion perceptions, including visual content, social context, temporal evolution, and location influence, are jointly investigated. Rolling multi-task hypergraph learning (RMTHG) is presented to consistently combine these factors and a learning algorithm is designed for automatic optimization. For evaluation, we set up a large scale image emotion dataset from Flickr, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net, on both dimensional and categorical emotion representations with over 1 million images and about 8,000 users. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significant performance gains on personalized emotion classification, as compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Previous works on image emotion analysis mainly focused on predicting the dominant emotion category or the average dimension values of an image for affective image classification and regression. However, this is often insufficient in various real-world applications, as the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different. In this paper, we propose to predict the continuous probability distribution of image emotions which are represented in dimensional valence-arousal space. We carried out large-scale statistical analysis on the constructed Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset, on which we observed that the emotion distribution can be well-modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. This model is estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm with specified initializations. Then, we extract commonly used emotion features at different levels for each image. Finally, we formalize the emotion distribution prediction task as a shared sparse regression (SSR) problem and extend it to multitask settings, named multitask shared sparse regression (MTSSR), to explore the latent information between different prediction tasks. SSR and MTSSR are optimized by iteratively reweighted least squares. Experiments are conducted on the Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset with comparisons to three alternative baselines. The quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Although saliency prediction in crowd has been recently recognized as an essential task for video analysis, it is not comprehensively explored yet. The challenges lie in that eye fixations in crowded scenes are inherently \"distinct\" and \"multi-modal\", which differs from those in regular scenes. To this end, the existing saliency prediction schemes typically rely on hand designed features with shallow learning paradigm, which neglect the underlying characteristics of crowded scenes. In this paper, we propose a saliency prediction model dedicated for crowd videos with two novelties: 1) Distinct units are discovered using deep representation learned by a Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoder (SDAE), considering perceptual properties of crowd saliency; 2) Contrast-based saliency is measured through deep reconstruction errors in the second SDAE trained on all units excluding distinct units. A unified model is integrated for online processing crowd saliency. Extensive evaluations on two crowd video benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively explore crowd saliency mechanism in two-stage SDAEs and achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods, with robustness to parameters.",

A person representation with thousands of dimensions tends to lead to the over-fitting problem, since only hundreds of training samples are available. To solve the small sample size problem, dimensionality reduction techniques are resorted for metric learning. Before dimension reduction, however, the image acquisition and feature extraction process may introduce some noise and redundant information, which lead to unexpected loss of discriminative power. To avoid this, we consider the structural information of human body along with supervision, and then introduce the Tree-guided Group Sparse (TGS) method for feature selection before dimension reduction. Experimental results on VIPeR dataset show the improvement of performance by applying TGS to the existing metric learning methods and demonstrate TGS can effectively remove noise and redundancy in person representation.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired appearance model for robust visual tracking. Motivated in part by the success of the hierarchical organization of the primary visual cortex (area V1), we establish an architecture consisting of five layers: whitening, rectification, normalization, coding, and pooling. The first three layers stem from the models developed for object recognition. In this paper, our attention focuses on the coding and pooling layers. In particular, we use a discriminative sparse coding method in the coding layer along with spatial pyramid representation in the pooling layer, which makes it easier to distinguish the target to be tracked from its background in the presence of appearance variations. An extensive experimental study shows that the proposed method has higher tracking accuracy than several state-of-the-art trackers.",

      "abstract": "Understanding a scene provided by very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has become a more and more challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new method for scene classification based on saliency computing of patches sampling from the VHR images. Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) is then adopted to select the corresponding informative salient patches for image scene representation. The proposed technique for selecting informative salient patches is efficient and robust for scene understanding. We conduct experiments on the public UC Merced benchmark dataset, which contains 21 different areal categories with sub-meter resolution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

However, most recent research on crowd video mainly focused on crowd behavior understanding and abnormal detection. In this study, as the very first attempt, we propose a crowd video retrieval method via deep attribute-embedding graph ranking. Group profiling attributes are capable of reflecting rich crowd patterns in videos. To deeply embed the specific relationship and manifold structure of crowd patterns, we integrate graph ranking, optimized weights learning and deep metric transforming in a unified regularization framework for crowd video retrieval. To sufficiently explore the effects of multiple attributes and their complementation in crowds, we devise several scene-independent visual descriptors specifically for each crowd video. Interpretable descriptors are categorized into different levels and structures as group profiling attributes, according to semantic properties of crowd patterns. Extensive experiments conducted on CUHK crowd dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, several methods have been developed to utilize hierarchical features learned from a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for visual tracking. However, as features from a certain CNN layer characterize an object of interest from only one aspect or one level, the performance of such trackers trained with features from one layer (usually the second to last layer) can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN based tracking framework, which takes full advantage of features from different CNN layers and uses an adaptive Hedge method to hedge several CNN based trackers into a single stronger one. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset of 100 challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to several state-of-theart trackers.",

      "abstract": "Images can convey rich semantics and evoke strong emotions in viewers. The research of my PhD thesis focuses on image emotion computing (IEC), which aims to predict the emotion perceptions of given images. The development of IEC is greatly constrained by two main challenges: affective gap and subjective evaluation. Previous works mainly focused on finding features that can express emotions better to bridge the affective gap, such as elements-of-art based features and shape features. According to the emotion representation models, including categorical emotion states (CES) and dimensional emotion space (DES), three different tasks are traditionally performed on IEC: affective image classification, regression and retrieval. The state-of-the-art methods on the three above tasks are image-centric, focusing on the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. For my PhD thesis, I plan to answer the following questions: (1) Compared to the low-level elements-of-art based features, can we find some higher level features that are more interpretable and have stronger link to emotions? (2) Are the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image subjective and different? If they are, how can we tackle the user-centric emotion prediction? (3) For image-centric emotion computing, can we predict the emotion distribution instead of the dominant emotion category?",

Different factors that may influence emotion perceptions, including visual content, social context, temporal evolution, and location influence are jointly investigated via the presented rolling multi-task hypergraph learning. For evaluation, we set up a large scale image emotion dataset from Flickr, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net, with over 1 million images and about 8,000 users. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to state-of-the-art.",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine representative actions of each actor, and show the remarkable power of such actions for actor identification task. Videos are firstly divided into shots and represented by BoW based on spatial-temporal features. Then we integrate the prototype theory with SVM to rank the shots and obtain the representative actions. Our method for actor identification combines representative actions with actors' appearance. We validate the method on episodes of the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\". The experimental results show that the representative actions are consistent with human judgements and can greatly improve the matching performance as complementary to existing handcrafted static features for actor identification.",

In this letter, we propose a new informative feature selection method for VHR scene classification. First, scale-invariant feature transform and speeded up robust feature operators are used to extract local features from the original VHR images to construct a visual dictionary. A sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) is then adopted to learn a set of informative features from the visual dictionary for each category. Finally, the scenes are represented by sparse informative low-level features. We conducted experiments on the University of California at Merced data set containing 21 different areal scene categories with submeter resolution and the Sydney data set containing seven land-use categories with 0.5-m spatial resolution. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods even without saliency detection.",

      "abstract": "Previous works on image emotion analysis mainly focused on assigning a dominated emotion category or the average dimension values to an image for affective image classification and regression. However, this is often insufficient in many applications, as the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different. In this paper, we propose to predict the continuous probability distribution of dimensional image emotions represented in valence-arousal space. By the statistical analysis on the constructed Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset, we represent the emotion distribution as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is estimated by the EM algorithm. Then we extract commonly used features of different levels for each image. Finally, we formulize the emotion distribution prediction as a multi-task shared sparse regression (MTSSR) problem, which is optimized by iteratively reweighted least squares. Besides, we introduce three baseline algorithms. Experiments conducted on the Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to some state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Dance is a special and important type of action, composed of abundant and various action elements. However, the recommendation of dance videos on the web are still not well studied. It is hard to realize it in the way of traditional methods using associated texts or static features of video content. In this paper, we study the problem focusing on extraction and representation of action information in dances. We propose to recommend dance videos based on the automatically discovered ``Dance Styles'', which play a significant role in characterizing different types of dances. To bridge the semantic gap of video content and mid-level concept, style, we take advantage of a mid-level action representation method, and extract representative patches as ``Dancelets'', a sort of intermediation between videos and the concepts. Furthermore, we propose to employ Motion Boundaries as saliency priors and sparsely extract patches containing more representative information to generate a set of dancelet candidates. Dancelets are then discovered by Normalized-cut method, which is superior in grouping visually similar patterns into the same clusters. For the fast and effective recommendation, a random forest-based index is built, and the ranking results are derived according to the matching results in all the leaf notes. Extensive experiments validated on the web dance videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for dance style discovery and video recommendation based on styles.",

With recent progress of DNN, almost all image classification tasks have achieved new records of accuracy. To extend the ability of DNN to image retrieval tasks, we proposed a unified DNN model for image-query similarity calculation by simultaneously modeling image and query in one network. The unified DNN is named the cross space mapping (CSM) model, which contains two parts, a convolutional part and a query-embedding part. The image and query are mapped to a common vector space via these two parts respectively, and image-query similarity is naturally defined as an inner product of their mappings in the space. To ensure good generalization ability of the DNN, we learn weights of the DNN from a large number of click-through logs which consists of 23 million clicked image-query pairs between 1 million images and 11.7 million queries. Both the qualitative results and quantitative results on an image retrieval evaluation task with 1000 queries demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Most existing works on affective image classification tried to assign a dominant emotion category to an image. However, this is often insufficient, as the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different. In this paper, we propose to predict the probability distribution of categorical image emotions. Firstly we extract commonly used features of different levels for each image. Then we formulize the emotion distribution prediction as a shared sparse leaning problem, which is optimized by iteratively reweighted least squares. Besides, we introduce three baseline algorithms. Experiments are carried out on a dataset of peer rated abstract paintings and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, as compared to some state-of-the-art approaches.",

With that, there have emerged considerable solid evidence which revealed the significance of sketch to us. However, there have been few profound discussions on sketch based action analysis so far. In this paper, we present a framework of converting human actions to commendable sketches and discovering distinctive action sketches. The action sketches should satisfy three characteristics: sketchability, objective-ness and consistency. Primitive sketches are prepared according to the structured forests based fast edge detection. Meanwhile, we take advantage of Struck to accomplish adaptive object tracking in parallel. After that, we propose a method to ensure the spatio-temporal consistency between every sequential action sketches. On completion of previous stages, the process of distinctive mining of action sketches is carried out. The experimental results show that our approach has a promising potential.",

In this paper, we applied dictionary learning methods to the task of facial expression recognition, which is then compared with SVM. In addition, we introduce a new dictionary learning method that incorporates side information, which is contained in the training data but not available in the testing phase. In particular, we introduce a new soft constraint derived from side information and combine it with the reconstruction error and the classification error to form a unified objective function. The optimal solution to the objective function is efficiently obtained using the K-SVD algorithm. Our algorithm learns the dictionary and an optimal linear classifier jointly. Experimental part demonstrates the effectiveness of the sparse representation classifiers for facial expression recognition problem, and dictionary learning with side information method achieves further improvement on low resolution facial expression recognition.",

In the Histograms of Oriented Gradients descriptor (HOG), the zero-order information of the gradients is captured. By contrast, in the HLAOG descriptor we accumulate the differences between gradient orientations and their nearest bin centers, which characterizes the distribution of the gradient orientations in regard to the bin centers. The HLAOG descriptor is demonstrated to be complementary to HOG in the experiments. Then, for setting the weights of the votes on different bins in a better way, we choose Gaussian function as the weighting method and present another new Gaussian Weighted Histograms of Oriented Gradients descriptor (called GWHOG) based on HOG. Evaluations on two public object recognition datasets (Caltech-101 and VOC2007) show that the combination of HOG and HLAOG outperforms HOG and the combination of HLAOG and GWHOG gets the best result.",

      "abstract": "Many target tracking videos suffer from significant shake due to the undesirable camera motion or target vibration. These degraded video records have a negative impact on viewing experience as well as the follow-up analysis and application. Most existing digital video stabilization methods aim at removing camera shake using the techniques of global motion estimation and compensation between adjacent frames, while paying little attention to motion pattern and the relationship between the foreground and background contents. In this paper, we present a novel approach to stabilize the videos containing large dynamic object, which can realize the normal stabilization task and describe the target motion path at the meantime. We combine K-means and Gaussian mixture model to distinguish the motion modes of background and foreground without applying any prior knowledge about the moving object. The proposed approach gives a flexible choice in stabilizing background motion as traditional algorithms or foreground motion for salient target surveillance.",

      "abstract": "With various novel methods having been proposed, recent years witnessed great progress in abnormal event detection. Broadly speaking, most existing methods can be divided into two categories: global feature representation based ones and local feature representation based ones, though the specific feature model and scale differ a lot. These two types of methods have reverse pros and cons: global feature representation methods can better guarantee spatial-temporal continuity of abnormal events but lack the ability to accurately model features of the basic event elements, while local feature methods are just the opposite. That makes their results complement each other. In this paper, we propose to explicitly apply temporal continuity constraint on sparse coding based local feature representation method, not just enlarging the scale of local feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our method can usually achieve more stable and smooth results, thus more high detection accuracy. In some cases, the performance gain can be enormous.",

Aware of its significance, plentiful sketch related studies have been conducted, such as sketch based image retrieval and recognition. However, very few works have researched the intrinsic factors that make sketch look vivid. In this paper, we explore the key to a good sketch by a weak supervised approach to discovery discriminative patches for different categories of sketches. For each class, we randomly extract tens of thousands of patches at multiple scales, which are represented by Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG). Then all patches are thrown into an iterative detection process to find the most discriminative ones. Experimentally, we analyze the visual results and give a reasonable discussion about good and bad sketches. Furthermore, more experimental results on the TU-Berlin sketch benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared to other available approaches.",

      "abstract": "Group detection becomes an important task in crowd behavior surveillance. However, most existing methods ignore the formation persistency characteristics, which predict unreliable interactions when the crowd is realistic and complex. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based method to declare that the formation period really matters for detecting social groups in crowd. First, we develop a socially motivated representation by modeling the formation period probability in a Bayesian manner, which results in social and temporal consistency for group member interactions. A graph is then established using individuals as nodes and formation periods as edge weights to reflect pedestrian relationships. In this way, seeking of socially consistent groups is converted into an optimization problem which seeks dense subgraphs with maximum formation likelihood within the graph structure. We employ graph shift optimization to detect groups by finding all the dense subgraphs due to its robust performance. In the experimental results on public datasets, our proposed method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel approach to non-rigid objects contour tracking in this paper based on a supervised level set model (SLSM). In contrast to most existing trackers that use bounding box to specify the tracked target, the proposed method extracts the accurate contours of the target as tracking output, which achieves better description of the non-rigid objects while reduces background pollution to the target model. Moreover, conventional level set models only emphasize the regional intensity consistency and consider no priors. Differently, the curve evolution of the proposed SLSM is object-oriented and supervised by the specific knowledge of the targets we want to track. Therefore, the SLSM can ensure a more accurate convergence to the exact targets in tracking applications. In particular, we firstly construct the appearance model for the target in an online boosting manner due to its strong discriminative power between the object and the background. Then, the learnt target model is incorporated to model the probabilities of the level set contour by a Bayesian manner, leading the curve converge to the candidate region with maximum likelihood of being the target. Finally, the accurate target region qualifies the samples fed to the boosting procedure as well as the target model prepared for the next time step. We firstly describe the proposed mechanism of two-phase SLSM for single target tracking, then give its generalized multi-phase version for dealing with multi-target tracking cases. Positive decrease rate is used to adjust the learning pace over time, enabling tracking to continue under partial and total occlusion. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the authors propose a collaborative composition model for automatically recommending suitable positions and poses in the scene of photography taken by amateurs. By analysing aesthetic‐aware features, the authors' strategy jointly takes attention and geometry composition into account to learn the aesthetic manifestation knowledge of professional photographers. Firstly, aesthetic composition representation exploits the strength of visual saliency to explicitly encode the spatial correlation of the professional photos. Secondly, ℓ2 regularised least square is adopted to constrain the representation coefficients, which provides a fast solution in selecting aesthetic candidates collaboratively. In addition, a novel confidence measure scheme is further designed based on reconstruction errors and the reference photos are updated adaptively according to the composition rules. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the model performs well for the portrait photographing recommendation.",

To achieve better performance, the complexity of CNNs is continually increasing with deeper and bigger architectures. Though CNNs achieved promising external classification behavior, understanding of their internal work mechanism is still limited. In this work, we attempt to understand the internal work mechanism of CNNs by probing the internal representations in two comprehensive aspects, i.e., visualizing patches in the representation spaces constructed by different layers, and visualizing visual information kept in each layer. We further compare CNNs with different depths and show the advantages brought by deeper architecture.",

      "abstract": "Latching dynamics retrieve pattern sequences successively by neural adaption and pattern correlation. We have previously proposed a modular latching chain model in Song et al. (2014) to better accommodate the structured transitions in the brain. Different cortical areas have different network structures. To explore how structural parameters like rewiring probability, threshold, noise and feedback connections affect the latching dynamics, two different connection schemes, K-nearest-neighbor network and modular network both having modular structure are considered. Latching chains are measured using two proposed measures characterizing length of intra-modular latching chains and sequential inter-modular association transitions. Our main findings include: (1) With decreasing threshold coefficient and rewiring probability, both the K-nearest-neighbor network and the modular network experience quantitatively similar phase change processes. (2) The modular network exhibits selectively enhanced latching in the small-world range of connectivity. (3) The K-nearest-neighbor network is more robust to changes in rewiring probability, while the modular network is more robust to the presence of noise pattern pairs and to changes in the strength of feedback connections. According to our findings, the relationships between latching chains in K-nearest-neighbor and modular networks and different forms of cognition and information processing emerging in the brain are discussed.",

Recent research on image emotion analysis mainly focused on affective image classification, trying to find features that can classify emotions better. We concentrate on affective image retrieval and investigate the performance of different features on different kinds of images in a multi-graph learning framework. Firstly, we extract commonly used features of different levels for each image. Generic features and features derived from elements-of-art are extracted as low-level features. Attributes and interpretable principles-of-art based features are viewed as mid-level features, while semantic concepts described by adjective noun pairs and facial expressions are extracted as high-level features. Secondly, we construct single graph for each kind of feature to test the retrieval performance. Finally, we combine the multiple graphs together in a regularization framework to learn the optimized weights of each graph to efficiently explore the complementation of different features. Extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Emotions can be evoked in humans by images. Most previous works on image emotion analysis mainly used the elements-of-art-based low-level visual features. However, these features are vulnerable and not invariant to the different arrangements of elements. In this paper, we investigate the concept of principles-of-art and its influence on image emotions. Principles-of-art-based emotion features (PAEF) are extracted to classify and score image emotions for understanding the relationship between artistic principles and emotions. PAEF are the unified combination of representation features derived from different principles, including balance, emphasis, harmony, variety, gradation, and movement. Experiments on the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), a set of artistic photography and a set of peer rated abstract paintings, demonstrate the superiority of PAEF for affective image classification and regression (with about 5% improvement on classification accuracy and 0.2 decrease in mean squared error), as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We then utilize PAEF to analyze the emotions of master paintings, with promising results.",

      "abstract": "Recent progress on tracking has focused on designing robust statistical model or proposing effective appearance features to improve precision. This paper addresses another problem, namely the discovery and tracking of generic multi-object which have the similar appearance and motion pattern based on limited human annotations. We present a model-free tracking method that can automatically discover and track multi-object sharing the same spatial and motion structure, and update the structure during the tracking without prior acknowledge. The candidate objects are first selected by a SVM classifier trained on histogram-of-gradient (HOG) features. Then a segment algorithm is exploited to decide the suitable sizes of tracking boxes. The structure constrains are updated in a real-time manner according to the motion measure among the specified object and corresponding candidates. Experimental results reveal significant convenience and remarkable performance of our approach for the task of structure preserving multi-object discovery and tracking.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel unsupervised crowd activity discovery algorithm aiming to automatically explore latent action patterns among crowd activities and partition them into meaningful clusters. Inspired by computational model of human vision system, we present a spatiotemporal saliency-based representation to simulate visual attention mechanism and encode human-focused components in an activity stream. Combining with feature pooling, we could obtain a more compact and robust activity representation. Based on the affinity matrix of activities, N-cut is performed to generate clusters with meaningful activity patterns. We carry out experiments on our proposed HIT-BJUT dataset and another public UMN dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised discovery method is capable of automatically mining meaningful activities from large-scale video data with mixed crowd activities.",

The covert attention mechanism allows small spatial displacement during saccadic eye-movements, which we believed to be responsible for the existence of a large number of imperfectly allocated eye fixations in current saliency benchmark datasets. Inspired by this new finding, we propose to use spatial pooling to integrate cover attention into the current saliency models. We test our pooling-based boosting strategy for 20 state-of-the-art attention models on two well acknowledged fixation datasets (YORK-120 & MIT-1003). The experimental results show that our method can stably improve the performance of over 95% of the tested models in the eye fixation prediction task.",

      "abstract": "Interactions among pedestrians usually play an important role in understanding crowd behavior. However, there are great challenges, such as occlusions, motion, and appearance variance, on accurate analysis of pedestrian interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel social attribute-aware force model (SAFM) for detection of abnormal crowd events. The proposed model incorporates social characteristics of crowd behaviors to improve the description of interactive behaviors. To this end, we first efficiently estimate the scene scale in an unsupervised manner. Then, we introduce the concepts of social disorder and congestion attributes to characterize the interaction of social behaviors, and construct our crowd interaction model on the basis of social force by an online fusion strategy. These attributes encode social interaction characteristics and offer robustness against motion pattern variance. Abnormal event detection is finally performed based on the proposed SAFM. In addition, the attribute-aware interaction force indicates the possible locations of anomalous interactions. We validate our method on the publicly available data sets for abnormal detection, and the experimental results show promising performance compared with alternative and state-of-the-art methods.",

By analyzing the statistical properties of human eye fixations on natural images, we found that human attention is sparsely distributed and usually deployed to locations with abundant structural information. This observations inspired us to model saccadic behavior and visual saliency based on super-Gaussian component (SGC) analysis. Our model sequentially obtains SGC using projection pursuit, and generates eye movements by selecting the location with maximum SGC response. Besides human saccadic behavior simulation, we also demonstrated our superior effectiveness and robustness over state-of-the-arts by carrying out dense experiments on synthetic patterns and human eye fixation benchmarks. Multiple key issues in saliency modeling research, such as individual differences, the effects of scale and blur, are explored in this paper. Based on extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results, we show promising potentials of statistical approaches for human behavior research.",

      "abstract": "Bird species classification has received more and more attention in the field of computer vision, for its promising applications in biology and environmental studies. Although methods derived from basic-level classification are introduced to bird species classification, most of them couldn't get a satisfied result due to the absence of discriminative features and quantization errors. In this paper, we introduce discriminative features for bird species classification based on parts of birds. We first crop and align the images, obtaining some patches specifying the parts of a bird. The patches are collected, forming some codebooks to learn the intermediate-level features using sparse coding algorithm. We then learn a model which characterize the discrimination of each part of every species of birds. Finally, the learned features combined with the model are concatenated to form the final representation for training and classification. We show the effectiveness of the discriminative features on the CUB-200-2011 dataset.",

      "abstract": "Playing appropriate music when watching images can make the images vivid and bring people into their intrinsic world. In this paper, we propose to musicalize images based on their emotions. Most of previous works on image emotion analysis mainly used elements-of-art based low-level visual features, which are vulnerable to the arrangements of elements. Here we propose to extract visual features, inspired by the concept of principles-of-art, to recognize image emotions. To enrich the descriptive power, a dimensional perspective is introduced to emotion modeling. Experiments on the IAPS dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods for emotion regression. The music in MST dataset with approximate emotions to the recognized image emotions is selected to musicalize these images. The user study results show its effectiveness and popularity of the image musicalization method.",

In viewing recent success of learned image feature by DNN, we propose an image matching algorithm based on DNN feature pyramid, named as DNN Flow. The nature of DNN feature pyramid in detecting different level patterns makes it is suitable to match two images in a coarse to fine manner, where top level coarsely matches two images in object level, middle level matches two images in part level, and low level finely matches two images in pixel level. The coarse to fine matching based on DNN feature pyramid is formulated as a series of optimization problems considering the guidance from top level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DNN Flow in image matching under challenge variations.",

To solve this problem, this paper presents a real-time night video enhancement approach. As observed that a pixel-wise inversion of a night video has quite similar appearance with the video acquired at foggy days, we use the similar idea of haze removal method to enhance the perceptual quality of the night videos. We present an improved dark channel prior model and integrate it with local smoothing and image Gaussian Pyramid operators. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the perceptual quality of night videos in real-time in terms of not only enhancing details, but also effectively avoiding excessive enhancement phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel crowd behavior representation, Bag of Trajectory Graphs (BoTG), is presented for dense crowd event recognition. To overcome huge loss of crowd structure and variability of motion in previous particle flow based methods, we design group-level representation beyond particle flow. From the observation that crowd particles are composed of atomic subgroups corresponding to informative behavior patterns, particle trajectories which simulate motion of individuals will be clustered to form groups at the first step. Then we connect nodes in each group as a trajectory graph and discover informative features to depict the graphs. A clip of crowd event can be further described by Bag of Trajectory Graphs (BoTG)-occurrences of behavior patterns, which provides critical clues for categorizing specific crowd event and detecting abnormality. The experimental results of abnormality detection and event recognition on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed BoTG on characterizing the group behaviors in dense crowd.",

Unlike existing sparse coding based approaches, our model does not need to learn a dictionary and directly sparsely codes the motion features of the center patches with features of its surrounding patches. The sparse coding error is used to measure the motion attention intensity of the center patch. To reflect the crowd abnormal intensity, an online updated weighting scheme is designed to obtain the global activity intensity map. Two publicly available datasets-UMN dataset and UCSD Ped1 dataset are utilized to evaluate our approach in detecting global abnormal event and local abnormal event, respectively. The experiments show our method achieves the promising performance and is competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Level set technique is novelly introduced into the mean shift sample space to implement kernel evolution and update. Since the active contour model is designed to drive the kernel constantly to the direction that maximizes target likelihood, the kernel can adapt to target shape variation simultaneously with the mean shift iterations. Thus, it can give a better estimation bias to produce accurate shift of the mean and successfully avoid performance loss stemmed from pollution of the non-object regions hiding inside the kernel. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the technique.",

Images with large variations are aligned via a smooth transition formed by some intermediate images. These intermediate images are found by shortest warping path algorithm on a directed complete graph. Moreover, the common regions in the images are discovered to further improve alignment performance. The experimental results show that our method is effective to map and align images of the same category but with large variations of appearance, shape and view.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel texture descriptor, Structured Texton, to extract and characterize meaningful texture patterns in images. Structured Textons are constructed by grouping local extremum regions connected by the nesting relationship. To further improve the discriminative ability, high order texton words are generated from the Structured Textons, preserving both the appearance information and the spatial information. Finally, a semantic ranking criterion is proposed for selecting the discriminative high order texton words by means of finding informative patterns from images. The proposed Structured Texton is more discriminative than the single texton-based representation. Experimental results of texture classification and scene classification on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and discrimination of the proposed Structured Texton.",

To represent the appearance information in videos, we utilize a random quantization method to obtain a more precise BoW-based representation. To calculate the similarity of two videos, we match the quantized interest point sets and map the matched pairs into the spatial-temporal offset space to compare the similarities of spatial-temporal structures. We leverage the KNN model to classify the actions. The experiment results on both KTH action dataset and YouTube action dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on action recognition.",

      "abstract": "Recently, sparse representation based visual tracking have been attracting increasing interests. Although reported desired performance, whether the sparse representation constrain is really useful is not clear. In addition, the high computation complexity also limits their usage in real-time applications. In this paper, we proposed a real-time visual tracking framework using ℓ <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> norm regularization based collaborative representation. Our framework represents any target candidate using a set of target templates and a set of background templates respectively, then combines their reconstruction errors to track the target accurately. By constraining ℓ <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> norm regularization on the representation coefficients, the coefficients can be solved analytically, which makes the proposed method run in real-time. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art trackers.",

Our method can be utilized to improve the performance of image classification and other tasks. We discuss the spatial consistency in global-scope restrained descriptors, by analyzing the appropriate sampling size. We apply the low rank method to solve the representative matrix of the descriptor sets at different scales, and obtain the optimized dense sampling size according to the lowest ranks of the representative matrices. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method gives an innovative and effective image representation, and it outperforms traditional dense sampling without size optimization.",

In consideration of the difference of adolescents and adults in aging mode, we utilize the facial feature ratios to classify face images into two groups: juveniles and adults. To eliminate the uncertainty lying in the face images, we elaborate a preprocessing procedure to the face images. Then, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), which is a powerful texture description methods, will be used to describe the appearance of face images based the preprocessed images. Finally, a back-propagation (BP) network is learned automatically by facial LBP features and predetermined outputs. Through this method, we accomplish the task of age classification well, which is a problem of nonlinear system. Given a face image of an uncertain age, the age group will be predicted by the learned BP network. Our experimental results indicate that our approach can achieve the goal of age classification well. Besides, the influence of gender is studied and we find that considering gender independently in age classification is advisable.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a computational model of visual representative ness by integrating cognitive theories of representative ness heuristics with computer vision and machine learning techniques. Unlike previous models that build their representative ness measure based on the visible data, our model takes the initial inputs as explicit positive reference and extend the measure by exploring the implic it negatives. Given a group of images that contains obvious visual concepts, we create a customized image ontology consisting of both positive and negative instances by mining the most related and confusable neighbors of the positive concept in ontological semantic knowledge bases. The representative ness of a new item is then determined by its likelihoods for both the positive and negative references. To ensure the effectiveness of probability inference as well as the cognitive plausibility, we discover the potential prototypes and treat them as an intermediate representation of semantic concepts. In the experiment, we evaluate the performance of representative ness models based on both human judgements and user-click logs of commercial image search engine. Experimental results on both Image Net and image sets of general concepts demonstrate the superior performance of our model against the state-of-the-arts.",

A Nested-SIFT group consists of a bounding feature and several member features covered by the bounding feature. To obtain a compact representation, SimHash strategy is used to compress member features in a Nested-SIFT group into a binary code, and the similarity between two Nested-SIFT groups is efficiently computed by using the binary codes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed Nested-SIFT approach.",

Convex edge segments and their combinations within each input image are modeled with respect to probabilities of belonging to candidate ellipses. Then, a dining plate is determined according to a confidence score. Finally, the presence/absence of an eating event in an image sequence is determined by analyzing successive frames. Our experimental results verified the effectiveness of this method.",

      "abstract": "Latching dynamics,designed by A.Treves from SISSA,is a kind of adaptive Potts dynamics model that derived from the unique infinite recursion capability hypothesis in human languages.It successfully explains the strategic transition phenomenon in human thinking,bringing great significance to the exploration of the emergence of human intelligence.But Latching dynamics runs on a single module,forfeiting a fruitful dialogue with the experimental evidence.A modular Latching chain is proposed by the introduction of delayed hetero-associative synapses,and the effects of structural parameters like rewiring probility,threshold,noise patterns pairs and feedback connections are analyzed by computational simulations.The main findings in the paper includes: 1) an appropriate rewiring probability promotes the intra-modular latching transitions.2) The average latching chain length and inverse switching ratio are insensitive to the noise and feedback connections.3) A larger threshold is necessary for the clear transition between modules.",

      "abstract": "With the great popularity and extensive application of Kinect, the Internet is sharing more and more depth data. To effectively use plenty of depth data would make great sense. In this paper, we propose a generalized dynamic depth data matching framework for action retrieval. Firstly we focus on single depth image matching utilizing both depth and shape feature. The depth feature used in our method is straightforward but proved to be very effective and robust for distinguishing various human actions. Then, we adopt shape context, which is widely used in shape matching, in order to strengthen the robustness of our matching strategy. Finally, we utilize Dynamic Time Warping to measure temporal similarity between two depth video sequences. Experiments based on a dataset of 17 classes of actions from 10 different individuals demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed matching strategy.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies of sparse representation in multimedia research focus on developing reliable and efficient dictionary learning algorithms. Despite the sparse prior, how to integrate other related perceptual factors of human being into dictionary learning process was seldom studied. In this paper, we investigate the influence of image memorability for human-centralized sparse representation. Based on the results of a photo memory game, we are able to quantitatively characterize an image's memorability which allows us to train sparse bases from the most memorable images instead of randomly selected natural images. We believed that such kind of basis is more consistent with neural networks in human brain and hence can better predict where human looks. To test our hypothesis, we choose human eye-fixation prediction problem for quantitative evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our Memorable Basis compared to traditional sparse basis trained from unselected images.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there is an ever-increasing research focus on Bag-of-Words based near duplicate visual search paradigm with inverted indexing. One fundamental yet unexploited challenge is how to maintain the large indexing structures within a single server subject to its memory constraint, which is extremely hard to scale up to millions or even billions of images. In this paper, we propose to parallelize the near duplicate visual search architecture to index millions of images over multiple servers, including the distribution of both visual vocabulary and the corresponding indexing structure. We optimize the distribution of vocabulary indexing from a machine learning perspective, which provides a \"memory light\" search paradigm that leverages the computational power across multiple servers to reduce the search latency. Especially, our solution addresses two essential issues: \"What to distribute\" and \"How to distribute\". \"What to distribute\" is addressed by a \"lossy\" vocabulary Boosting, which discards both frequent and indiscriminating words prior to distribution. \"How to distribute\" is addressed by learning an optimal distribution function, which maximizes the uniformity of assigning the words of a given query to multiple servers. We validate the distributed vocabulary indexing scheme in a real world location search system over 10 million landmark images. Comparing to the state-of-the-art alternatives of single-server search [5],[6], [16] and distributed search [23], our scheme has yielded a significant gain of about 200% speedup at comparable precision by distributing only 5% words. We also report excellent robustness even when partial servers crash.",

In contrast with conventional level sets methods, which are blind to target and emphasize the intensity consistency only, the proposed level set method is strengthened by making full use of the tracking context. By associating multiple feature spaces, the most discriminative target information is extracted and fused into the energy functional to drive the curve evolution. Therefore, the proposed level set method can lead an accurate convergence to the object in real-world tracking applications, as well as solving multi-mode object segmentation problem facing a typical level-set tracker. The update mechanism implemented on the target model enables tracking to continue under occlusion. Experiments confirm the robustness and reliability of our method.",

We take social characteristics of crowd behaviors into account in order to improve the effectiveness of the simulation on the interaction behaviors of the crowd. A quick unsupervised method is proposed to estimate the scene scale. Both the social disorder attribute and congestion attribute are introduced to describe the realistic social behaviors by using statistical context feature. Through the semantic attribute-aware enhancement, we obtain an improved model on the basis of social force. We validate our method in public available datasets for abnormal detection, and the experimental results show promising performance compared with other state of the art methods.",

By analyzing aesthetic characteristics features, we propose a solution by constructing aesthetic composition representation which covers the attention composition and geometry composition to identify the underlying technique of professional photographer. First, we extract the attention composition feature of the professional photo by utilizing a visual saliency model. Then, a geometry composition feature is also presented to learn the spatial correlation. Finally, composition rules are applied to make appropriate pose and position. Experiments show our aesthetic composition representation performs well for portrait photographing recommendation.",

In this paper, we study the scale of edges, and try to answer two questions: 1) what is the scale of edges, and 2) how to calculate it. From the points of human cognition and physical interpretation, we illustrate the existence of the scale of edges and provide a quantitative definition. Then, an automatic edge scale selection approach is proposed. Finally, a cognitive experiment is conducted to validate the rationality of the detected scales. Moreover, the importance of identifying the scale of edges is also shown in applications such as boundary detection and hierarchical edge parsing.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent video surveillance is currently one of the most active research topics in computer vision, especially when facing the explosion of video data captured by a large number of surveillance cameras. As a key step of an intelligent surveillance system, robust visual tracking is very challenging for computer vision. However, it is a basic functionality of the human visual system (HVS). Psychophysical findings have shown that the receptive fields of simple cells in the visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented, and bandpass, and it forms a sparse, distributed representation of natural images. In this article, motivated by these findings, we propose an effective appearance model based on sparse coding and apply it in visual tracking. Specifically, we consider the responses of general basis functions extracted by independent component analysis on a large set of natural image patches as features and model the appearance of the tracked target as the probability distribution of these features. In order to make the tracker more robust to partial occlusion, camouflage environments, pose changes, and illumination changes, we further select features that are related to the target based on an entropy-gain criterion and ignore those that are not. The target is finally represented by the probability distribution of those related features. The target search is performed by minimizing the Matusita distance between the distributions of the target model and a candidate using Newton-style iterations. The experimental results validate that the proposed method is more robust and effective than three state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "How can interest point detectors benefit from contextual cues? In this articles, we introduce a context-aware semi-local detector (CASL) framework to give a systematic answer with three contributions: (1) We integrate the context of interest points to recurrently refine their detections. (2) This integration boosts interest point detectors from the traditionally local scale to a semi-local scale to discover more discriminative salient regions. (3) Such context-aware structure further enables us to bring forward category learning (usually in the subsequent recognition phase) into interest point detection to locate category-aware, meaningful salient regions. Our CASL detector consists of two phases. The first phase accumulates multiscale spatial correlations of local features into a difference of contextual Gaussians (DoCG) field. DoCG quantizes detector context to highlight contextually salient regions at a semi-local scale, which also reveals visual attentions to a certain extent. The second phase locates contextual peaks by mean shift search over the DoCG field, which subsequently integrates contextual cues into feature description. This phase enables us to integrate category learning into mean shift search kernels. This learning-based CASL mechanism produces more category-aware features, which substantially benefits the subsequent visual categorization process. We conducted experiments in image search, object characterization, and feature detector repeatability evaluations, which reported superior discriminability and comparable repeatability to state-of-the-art works.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multiple-channel coding scheme to extract compact visual descriptors for low bit rate mobile visual search. Different from previous visual search scenarios that send the query image, we make use of the ever growing mobile computational capability to directly extract compact visual descriptors at the mobile end. Meanwhile, stepping forward from the state-of-the-art compact descriptor extractions, we exploit the rich contextual cues at the mobile end (such as GPS tags for mobile visual search and 2D barcodes or RFID tags for mobile product search), together with the visual statistics at the reference database, to learn multiple coding channels. Therefore, we describe the query with one of many forms of high-dimensional visual signature, which is subsequently mapped to one or more channels and compressed. The compression function within each channel is learnt based on a novel robust PCA scheme, with specific consideration to preserve the retrieval ranking capability of the original signature. We have deployed our scheme on both iPhone4 and HTC DESIRE 7 to search ten million landmark images in a low bit rate setting. Quantitative comparisons to the state-of-the-arts demonstrate our significant advantages in descriptor compactness (with orders of magnitudes improvement) and retrieval mAP in mobile landmark, product, and CD/book cover search.",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to index and recommend videos based on affective analysis, mainly on facial expression recognition of viewers. We first build a facial expression recognition classifier by embedding the process of building compositional Haar-like features into hidden conditional random fields (HCRFs). Then we extract viewers' facial expressions frame by frame through the videos, collected from the camera when viewers are watching videos, to obtain the affections of viewers. Finally, we draw the affective curve which tells the process of affection changes. Through the curve, we segment each video into affective sections, give the indexing result of the videos, and list recommendation points from views' aspect. Experiments on our collected database from the web show that the proposed method has a promising performance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a fast and robust unsupervised framework for anomaly detection and localization in crowed scenes. Our method avoids modeling the normal state of the crowds which is a very complex task due to the large within class variance of the normal target appearance and motion patterns. For each video frame, we extract the spatial temporal features of 3D blocks and generate the saliency map using a block-based center-surround difference operator. Then, motion vector matrix is obtained by adaptive rood pattern search block-matching algorithm and distance normalization. Attractive motion disorder descriptor is proposed to measure the global intensity of anomalies in the scene. Finally, we classify the frames into normal and anomalous ones by a binary classifier. In the experiments, we compared our method against several state-of-the-art approaches on UCSD dataset which is a widely used anomaly detection and localization benchmark. As the only unsupervised approach, our method outputs competitive results with near real-time processing speed",

      "abstract": "Web videos such as YouTube are hard to obtain sufficient precisely labeled training data and analyze due to the complex ontology. To deal with these problems, we present a hierarchical web video classification framework by learning heterogeneous web data, and construct a bottom-up semantic forest of video concepts by learning from meta-data. The main contributions are two-folds: firstly, analysis about middle-level concepts' distribution is taken based on data collected from web communities, and a concepts redistribution assumption is made to build effective transfer learning algorithm. Furthermore, an AdaBoost-Like transfer learning algorithm is proposed to transfer the knowledge learned from Flickr images to YouTube video domain and thus it facilitates video classification. Secondly, a group of hierarchical taxonomies named Semantic Forest are mined from YouTube and Flickr tags which reflect better user intention on the semantic level. A bottom-up semantic integration is also constructed with the help of semantic forest, in order to analyze video content hierarchically in a novel perspective. A group of experiments are performed on the dataset collected from Flickr and YouTube. Compared with state-of-the-arts, the proposed framework is more robust and tolerant to web noise.",

      "abstract": "A visual codebook serves as a fundamental component in many state-of-the-art computer vision systems. Most existing codebooks are built based on quantizing local feature descriptors extracted from training images. Subsequently, each image is represented as a high-dimensional bag-of-words histogram. Such highly redundant image description lacks efficiency in both storage and retrieval, in which only a few bins are nonzero and distributed sparsely. Furthermore, most existing codebooks are built based solely on the visual statistics of local descriptors, without considering the supervise labels coming from the subsequent recognition or classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a task-dependent codebook compression framework to handle the above two problems. First, we propose to learn a compression function to map an originally high-dimensional codebook into a compact codebook while maintaining its visual discriminability. This is achieved by a codeword sparse coding scheme with Lasso regression, which minimizes the descriptor distortions of training images after codebook compression. Second, we propose to adapt our codebook compression to the subsequent recognition or classification tasks. This is achieved by introducing a label constraint kernel (LCK) into our compression loss function. In particular, our LCK can model heterogeneous kinds of supervision, i.e., (partial) category labels, correlative semantic annotations, and image query logs. We validated our codebook compression in three computer vision tasks: 1) object recognition in PASCAL Visual Object Class 07; 2) near-duplicate image retrieval in UKBench; and 3) web image search in a collection of 0.5 million Flickr photographs. Our compressed codebook has shown superior performances over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised codebooks.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there have been ever-growing geographical tagged photos on the community Web sites such as Flickr. Discovering touristic landmarks from these photos can help us to make better sense of our visual world. In this article, we report our work on mining landmarks from geotagged Flickr photos for city scene summarization and touristic recommendations. We begin by exploring the geographical and visual statistics of the Web users' photographing manner, based on which we conduct landmark mining in two steps: First, we propose to partition each city into geographical regions based on spectral clustering over the geotags of Flickr photos. Second, in each landmark region, we present a representative photo mining scheme based on sparse representation. Our main idea is to regard the landmark mining problem as a process to find photos whose visual signatures can be reconstructed using other photos of this landmark region with a minimal coding length. This sparse reconstruction scheme offers a general perspective to mine the representative photos. Indeed, by simplifying the data correlation constraints in our scheme, several previous works in representative photo discovery and landmark mining can be derived. Finally, we introduce a Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search model to refine our landmark ranking, which incorporates the community knowledge to simulate the landmark ranking problem as a dynamic page ranking problem. We have deployed our proposed landmark mining framework on a city scene summarization and navigation system, which works on one million geotagged Flickr photos coming from twenty worldwide metropolises. We have also quantitatively compared our scheme with several state-of-the-art works.",

This paper introduces a PKUBench benchmark for the quantitative evaluations of mobile visual search with the support of GPS. It contains 13,179 images organized into 198 distinct landmark locations within the Peking University campus. Each location is captured with multiple shot sizes and viewing angles, using both digital cameras and phone cameras, each photo being tagged with rich contextual information in the mobile scenario. Moreover, this benchmark studies typical quality degeneration scenarios in mobile photographing, including variable resolutions, blurring, lighting changes, occlusions, as well as various viewing angles. Together with this benchmark, we provide the bag-of-visual-words search baselines involving contextual information refinement. Finally, distractor images are further introduced to evaluate the robustness of visual search methods in this database.",

In this paper, motivated by the fact that a tracked object is usual- ly embedded into context that provides useful information for estimating the target, we propose a novel tracking algorithm named Tracking with Context Prediction (TCP). The context here includes the neighboring objects and specific parts of tar- get. The proposed method simultaneously track the target and context objects using the existing tracking methods. The positions of the context objects are used to predict the position of the target. Thus, the target can be stably tracked even when it is partially or fully occluded. By computing the probability of each prediction being target, our algorithm allows the drifting of context objects during tracking and do not require predictions from all context objects are correct. Experiments on challenging sequences show significant improvements especially in the case of occlusions and appearance changes.",

      "abstract": "Modern clothes are designed based on various visual elements of different fashion styles. Traditional vision-based clothes recommendation methods focused on searching clothes which are similar with user preferred samples in the aspects of colors and partial shape elements. In this paper, we propose a method of recommending clothes by mining visual elements of different fashion styles. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is employed to extract sparse features, and then Term-Frequency (TF) analysis is applied to discover visual elements from these independent components. Finally, we test three ranking metrics for clothes recommendation including Euclidian distance of TFs, Cosine distance of TFs and Minimum TF. Experimental results based on web commercial images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Given the current user location and his touristic destination, our system can suggest a shortest trip path that visits as many popular landmarks as possible. To this end, we collect geographical tagged photos from Flickr [1] and Panoramio [2] photo sharing websites. Then a geographical graph is constructed by modeling photos as vertices and their geographical and visual closenesses as connection strengths. In this graph, we mine a dominant subgraph by quantizing nearby and visually duplicated vertices, and then trimming unpopular subgraphs. Such dominant subgraph only retains the popular landmarks from the consensus of travelers in this city. In online suggestion, we map the current user location and the target location to the nearest vertices in this subgraph, based on which an optimal trip is suggested through a shortest path search. We have quantitatively validated our system in typical areas including Beijing and New York City, with quantitative comparisons to alternative approaches.",

In contrast with traditional level set models which emphasize the intensity consistent segmentation and consider no priors, the proposed DAMLSM takes the context of tracking into account and use a discriminative patch based target model to guide the curve evolution. By modeling both the region and edge cues in a Bayesian manner, the proposed level set method can lead an accurate convergence to the candidate region with maximum likelihood of being the target. Finally, we update the target model to adapt to the appearance variation, enabling tracking to continue under occlusion. Experiments confirm the robustness and reliability of our method.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel mean shift approach in this paper for robust object tracking based on an inertial potential model. Conventional mean shift based trackers exploit only appearance information of observation to determine the target location which usually cannot effectively distinguish the foreground from background in complex scenes. In contrast, by constructing the inertial potential model, the proposed algorithm makes good use of motion information of previous frames adaptively to track the target. Then the probability of all candidates is modeled by considering both the photometric and motion cues in a Bayesian manner, leading the mean shift vector finally converge to the location with maximum likelihood of being the target. Experimental results on several challenging video sequences have verified that the proposed method is compared very robust and effective with the traditional mean shift based trackers in many complicated scenes.",

      "abstract": "Inspired by the stability functions of human vision system, we present a novel video stabilization method based on saliency driven SIFT matching and discriminative RANSAC. Firstly, a saliency detection method is adopted to estimate the spatial distribution of visual attention degrees in each frame of the video, and the SIFT features are extracted from the salient regions indicated by the saliency map. Then, we further achieve a modified version of RANSAC method using the discriminative features to estimate the trajectory of inter-frame motion and reduce the errors caused by the foreground vector. Finally, Kalman filter is applied to complete the motion smoothing task. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is efficient and promising compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

Different with the existing methods, we consider the spatiotemporal context both in the feature extraction phase and in the feature description phase. We present a space time constraint and salience rank strategies to extract the representative interest points. Then, we propose a novel space time context phrase method to mining and describe the semantic and spatiotemporal correlation of interest points. Finally, the space time context phrase is used in the nearest neighbor classifier to classify dynamic texture scene. We test our algorithm on the dynamic texture classification and human action classification tasks on the Dyntex dataset and the KTH dataset, respectively. The results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the tasks.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel affective video classification method based on facial expression recognition by learning the spatio-temporal feature fusion of actors' and viewers' facial expressions. For spatial features, we integrate Haar-like features into compositional ones according to the features' correlation, and train a mid classifier during the period. Then this process is embedded into improved AdaBoost learning algorithm to obtain spatial features. And for temporal feature fusion, we adopt hidden dynamic conditional random fields (HDCRFs) based on HCRFs by introducing time dimension variable. Finally spatial features are embedded into HDCRFs to recognize facial expressions. Experiments on the well-known Cohn-Kanada database show that the proposed method has a promising recognition performance. And affective classification experimental results on our own videos show that most subjects are satisfied with the classification results.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel approach to non-rigid object tracking based on a supervised level set model (SLSM). In contrast with conventional level set models, which emphasize the intensity consistency only and consider no priors, the curve evolution of the proposed SLSM is object-oriented and supervised by the specific knowledge of the target we want to track. Therefore, the SLSM can ensure a more accurate convergence to the target in tracking applications. In particular, we firstly construct the appearance model for the target in an on-line boosting manner due to its strong discriminative power between objects and background. Then the probability of the contour is modeled by considering both the region and edge cues in a Bayesian manner, leading the curve converge to the candidate region with maximum likelihood of being the target. Finally, accurate target region qualifies the samples fed the boosting procedure as well as the target model prepared for the next time step. Positive decrease rate is used to adjust the learning pace over time, enabling tracking to continue under partial and total occlusion. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the technique.",

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art mobile visual search systems put emphasis on developing compact visual descriptors, which enables low bit rate wireless transmission instead of delivering an entire query image. In this paper, we address the orderless nature of the transmission set of query descriptors . We propose to adapt the orders of local descriptors in transmission, which subsequently yields more consistent statistic distributions in each feature dimension towards more efficient residual coding based compression. Our scheme further enables lossy sorting by an adaptive quantization strategy within each feature dimension, which largely improves the compression rates of the residual coding in each dimension. We show that the performance degeneration of such lossy sorting is acceptable in our mobile landmark search applications. Our approach's effectiveness and efficiency is demonstrated via extensive experimental comparisons to state-of-the art works in both mobile visual descriptors and compact image signatures.",

      "abstract": "We present a low bit rate vocabulary coding scheme in the context of mobile landmark search. Our scheme exploits location cues to boost a compact subset of visual vocabulary, which is discriminative for visual search and incurs low bit rate query for efficient upstream wireless transmission. To validate the coding scheme, we have developed mobile landmark search prototype systems within typical areas including Beijing, New York City, Lhasa, Singapore, and Florence. Our system maintains a single vocabulary in a mobile device, which can be efficiently adapted with the location information of city-scale mobile users. Thus multiple downloading of large vocabulary is completely avoided for normal city tourists. In landmark search domain, we have reported superior performance over the state-of-the art works in compact image descriptors or signatures.",

In this paper, we give a systematic investigation about how geographical location affects the effectiveness of codeword frequency. We explain why the standard IDF in the BoW models is less effective in location related search applications [11][12]. Consequently, we propose a \"location discriminative codeword frequency\" strategy to introduce the location context into the codeword discriminability measurement. This new codeword frequency is calculated in each geographical region, for which a spectral clustering scheme is proposed to partition the geographical map of each city into distinct regions. Extensive comparisons over the standard codeword frequency in state-of-the-art landmark search systems [1][1] demonstrates our approach's effectiveness.",

In this paper, we address the orderless nature of the transmission set of query descriptors . We propose to adapt the orders of local descriptors in transmission, which subsequently yields more consistent statistic distributions in each feature dimension towards more efficient residual coding based compression. Our scheme further enables lossy sorting by an adaptive quantization strategy within each feature dimension, which largely improves the compression rates of the residual coding in each dimension. We show that the performance degeneration of such lossy sorting is acceptable in our mobile landmark search applications. Our approach’s effectiveness and efficiency is demonstrated via extensive experimental comparisons to state-of-the art works in both mobile visual descriptors [2][4] and compact image signatures [5].",

This paper proposes a novel robust texture descriptor on variance in rotation, scale and illumination, which combines the dominant orientation analysis and multifractal analysis base on Gabor filter. The dominant orientations are extracted in corresponding Gaussian scales to handle the rotation variance, and then the scale and illumination invariant multifractal spectrum (MFS) is produced based on the multi-scale Gabor filters at the corresponding dominant orientation. The proposed approach is evaluated on Brodatz and Outex databases. The experiment results show that our method outperforms existing techniques under different condition variances.",

To solve these problems, a novel Visual Topic Model framework is proposed, via unsupervised clustering techniques. The framework aims at analyzing image semantics fusing both content and context, by considering tag correlations and ambiguities. In fact, the tags highly correlated in context may vary greatly in visual content and thus represent different semantics. Furthermore, a keyword selection and image annotation algorithm is also developed and applied to Flickr database with 175,770 images. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, credible performance provides solid support for our framework.",

Different with previous works that learnt sparse features from large scale natural statistics, we propose to learn features from short-term statistics of single images. For saliency measurement, we define background firing rate (BFR) for each sparse feature, and then we propose to use feature activation rate (FAR) to measure the bottom-up visual saliency. The proposed FAR measure is biological plausible and easy to compute, also with satisfied performance. Experiments on human eye fixations and psychological patterns demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "There have been several stereo matching methods that perform well under the circumstance of color consistency. However, various factors including radiometric and device variations between images will drop color consistency and then seriously degrade the performance of those methods. In this paper, we propose a robust method to cover these situations. We use a measurement combining SIFT descriptor in intensity space after color histogram equalization with Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) in color invariant log-chromaticity intensity space to compute the cost of point correspondence. The measurement ensures that illumination-independent gradient information and color invariant correlated information are integrated properly. We evaluate our method and find it outperform state-of-the-art algorithms, in particular on the datasets for radiometric variations.",

We propose that bottom-up saliency is not based on global statistics but on information sampled at prior eye fixations. Our model calculates visual saliency using sequential eye fixation probability. However, the proposed model needs fixation priors, which are hard to simulate given current fixation data and experimental conditions. An approximation is proposed to generate a single saliency map by fusing all possible conditions of fixation prior. Our method outperforms all state-of-the-art models in predicting eye fixations, and shows reasonable response to various psychological patterns.",

In contrast with traditional trackers whose computations cover the whole target region and may easily be polluted by the similar background pixels, we divided the target into a number of patches and take the most discriminative one as the tracking basis. With the consideration of both the photometric and spatial information, we construct a discriminative target model on it. Then, a likelihood map can be got by comparing the target model with candidate regions, on which the mean shift procedure is employed for mode seeking. Finally, we update the target model to adapt to the appearance variation. Experiments confirm the robustness and reliability of our method.",

This is a semantic level multimedia application. We proposed a co-clustering method based on facial and body feature, and defined a new type of measurement to combine the two features more reasonable. 2D-PCA detector is used to extract facial feature, and K-Means algorithm is used for clustering. Body features, based on Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for human detection, combines with Bayes Decision Theory to amend above clustering results. We tested the system in three data sets, including more than 1100 minutes of video. Experimental results show that our approach is feasible and demonstrated good performance in accuracy.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel object tracking algorithm based on modeling the target appearance in a joint space. In contrast with traditional histogram-based trackers which discard all spatial information, the joint space takes both the photometric and spatial information into account. Within this joint space, the target is modeled in a Gaussian mixtures manner where a richer description of the target is captured to increase robustness in tracking. The particle filter procedure is employed for sampling and dealing with the problem of getting trapped in local optimum. Finally, the updating step enables tracking to continue under severe occlusion. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.",

      "abstract": "In natural image matting, various kinds of algorithms have been recently proposed. Moreover, alpha matting results have also been generated for comparison and composition into new backgrounds. However, all these methods have to make an alpha matte comparison to the ground truth so that one can get the final pixel-wised evaluation of these results. Nevertheless, while the input datasets are just used for test and there are no ground truth mattes, it is not possible to perform comparisons and to generate the quantitative comparison results. In this paper we combine the two ideas above and propose a new pixel-wise alpha mattes evaluation method. This approach is based on using local windows to measure gradient correlation between image and the matte. An optimal image channel minimizing the image variance is also selected at each window in order to perform the correlation more correctly. Experimental result shows that, our system can generate precise evaluation result for each pixel of each matte without ground truth.",

      "abstract": "Retina ganglia cells (RGCs) connect to the tectum neurons in the midbrain through 1–1 strict topic mapping, which benefits the precise information transmission and is called retinotopic mapping. It's significant to understand the underlying mechanisms that contributing to the topic mapping. Inspired by the experimental observations given by [Nicol et al 2007 Nat. Neurosci. 10(3):340], we divide the retinotectal mapping into three almost independent stages, axon overshooting, axon retraction, and the final refinement of axons and arborization. In order to analyze the roles that forward signaling, reverse signaling and neural activity plays in different stages, an axon retraction model and a refinement procedure have been proposed to simulate the retinotopic mapping process. We testify the asymmetry of gradients between forward signaling and reverse signaling, and find that it is the forward signaling that dominates the axon retraction. Also, the refinement procedure demonstrates that the reverse-signaling-induced gradient branching and the synapse-dependent neural activity lead the RGC axons projecting to the topic target tectum neurons.",

According to a constructed equivalence relation based on the capacity of hiding units, all hiding units can be partitioned into equivalence classes. Following that, the hiding procedure is performed in predefined order in equivalence classes as the traditional steganography scheme. Because of considering the relation between the length of message and capacity, the performance of the hiding method using proposed hiding strategy outperforms the original approaches when embedding the same length message. Experimental results indicate that the gain from the proposed strategy over existing hiding schemes can reach up to 4.0 dB.",

While state-of-the-art approaches build visual vocabulary based solely on visual statistics of local image patches, the correlative image labels are left unexploited in generating visual words. In this work, we present a semantic embedding framework to integrate semantic information from Flickr labels for supervised vocabulary construction. Our main contribution is a Hidden Markov Random Field modeling to supervise feature space quantization, with specialized considerations to label correlations: Local visual features are modeled as an Observed Field, which follows visual metrics to partition feature space. Semantic labels are modeled as a Hidden Field, which imposes generative supervision to the Observed Field with WordNet-based correlation constraints as Gibbs distribution. By simplifying the Markov property in the Hidden Field, both unsupervised and supervised (label independent) vocabularies can be derived from our framework. We validate our performances in two challenging computer vision tasks with comparisons to state-of-the-arts: (1) Large-scale image search on a Flickr 60,000 database; (2) Object recognition on the PASCAL VOC database.",

      "abstract": "Treating visual object tracking as foreground and background classification problem has attracted much attention in the past decade. Most methods adopt mean shift or brute force search to perform object tracking on the generated probability map, which is obtained from the classification results; however, performing probabilistic object tracking on the probability map is almost unexplored. This paper proposes a novel observation model which is suitable to perform this task. The observation model considers both region and boundary cues on the probability map, and can be computed very efficiently by using the integral image data structure. Extensive experiments are carried out on several challenging image sequences, which include abrupt motion change, background clutter, partial occlusion, and significant appearance change. Quantitative experiments are further performed with several related trackers on a public benchmark dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel and robust object tracking algorithm based on sparse representation. Object tracking is formulated as a object recognition problem rather than a traditional search problem. All target candidates are considered as training samples and the target template is represented as a linear combination of all training samples. The combination coefficients are obtained by solving for the minimum l1-norm solution. The final tracking result is the target candidate associated with the non-zero coefficient. Experimental results on two challenging test sequences show that the proposed method is more effective than the widely used mean shift tracker.",

      "abstract": "Object tracking plays a very important role in many computer vision applications. However its performance will significantly deteriorate due to some challenges in complex scene, such as pose and illumination changes, clustering background and so on. In this paper, we propose a robust object tracking algorithm which exploits both global color and local scale invariant (SIFT) features in a particle filter framework. Due to the expensive computation cost of SIFT features, the proposed tracker adopts a speed-up variation of SIFT, SURF, to extract local features. Specially, the proposed method first finds matching points between the target model and target candidate, than the weight of the corresponding particle based on scale invariant features is computed as the the proportion of matching points of that particle to matching points of all particles, finally the weight of the particle is obtained by combining weights of color and SURF features with a probabilistic way. The experimental results on a variety of challenging videos verify that the proposed method is robust to pose and illumination changes and is significantly superior to the standard particle filter tracker and the mean shift tracker.",

      "abstract": "Traditional particle filter which uses simple geometric shapes for representation cannot track objects with complex shape accurately. In this paper, we propose a refined particle filter method for contour tracking based on a binary level set model. In contrast with other previous work, the computational efficiency is greatly improved due to the simple form of the level set function. In addition, we perform curve evolution in the update step to make good use of the observation at current time. Finally, we consider some appearance information as well as the energy function to measure the weight for particles, which can identify the target more accurately. Experiment results on several challenging video sequences have verified the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective in many complicated scenes.",

      "abstract": "Partial occlusion is one of the most challenging difficulties for object tracking. In this paper, we present an approach to address this problem by using an effective appearance model which has two innovations. First, in contrast to widely used color histogram that models the appearance of an object using only color information, we assert that both color and texture are important cues for tracking, especially in the presence of complex background. We thus propose a novel local descriptor, named local color texture pattern (LCTP), to model the appearance of the object with color and texture information simultaneously. Second, global color histogram completely ignores the spatial layout information of an object and are sensitive to partial occlusion. In this work, we overcome this limitation based on a block-dividing way: 1) divide target into multiple blocks and then represent each block with LCTP histogram, 2) with a selectivity strategy, we select blocks that are not occluded and then combine similarities of those selected blocks to obtain final similarity measure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to partial occlusion than two state-of-the-art algorithms.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel texture description approach, which is robust to variances in rotation, scale and illumination in images, to classify the texture of images. A limitation with traditional methods is that they are more or less sensitive to the mentioned changes in images. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel Local Haar Binary Pattern (LHBP) based framework to ensure invariance in global rotation, scale, and light change. Our method consists of two components: feature extraction and scale self-adaptive classification. The global rotation invariant LHBP histogram features are extracted against the variances of illumination and global rotation, and the scale self-adaptive strategy is used for optimizing the classification of different scale textures. Evaluation results on Outex and Brodatz databases illustrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach over existing algorithms.",

Based on multiple camera scenes, we propose a 3D silhouette tracking framework to resolve occlusions and recover the appearances in 3D space, which enhances tracking effectiveness. In the framework, 2D object silhouettes are initially gained by <i>Snake</i>. Then a <i>Voxel Space Carving</i> procedure is introduced to simultaneously generate the occlusion model and visual hull of objects. Next, we adopt <i>Particle Filter </i>to select the valuable parts of occlusion model and combine them with the initial object silhouettes to generate the updated visual hull. Finally, updated visual hull of the objects are re-projected to each view to obtain their final contours. The experiments under the public LAB and SCULPTURE datasets validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework.",

Abstract:This paper proposes the combination of sign language linguistics with human kinematics to generate and detect the data of SISL (signer independent sign language) according to the characteristics of gesture sign language (GSL). An improved Mean-Shift algorithm is applied to the generation of hand shape data channels without losing the linguistic features of GSL, and then the key hand shape phonetic notation is used to detect the effectiveness of data. In order to enrich the kinematic characteristics of GSL, an improved genetic algorithm is applied to the generation of movement related data channels. Moreover, Labannotation is adopted to inspect the effectiveness of data. Finally, an experimental inspection framework is established based on an original sample to make the proposed detection method adapt to multi-classes data inspection of linguistics. Experimental results show that the proposed method for the generation and detection of SISL data is effective and feasible. 参考文献 相似文献 引证文献",

In this paper, motivated by these psychophysical findings, we propose a robust visual tracking algorithm by simulating such feature-based visual attention. Specially, we consider the general sparse basis functions extracted on a large set of natural image patches as features. We define that a feature is related to the target when succeeding activations of that feature cannot increase system's entropy. The target is finally represented by the probability distribution of those related features. The target search is performed by minimizing the Matusita distance measure between the distributions of the target model and candidate using Newton-style iterations. The experimental results verify that the proposed method is more robust and effective than widely used mean shift based methods.",

In this paper, we introduce a graph-based actor correlations mining framework, which serves as the first attempt for effective actor association presentation and concurrence search. We leverage face detection and tracking to locate actors with 2D-PCA detector as pretreatment. To measure the actor association into a unified graph, we propose a context-based actor correlations hierarchical parsing approach, which considers video structure and hierarchical concurrence to refine actor association in our graph modeling. We not only can accomplish actor correlations mining, but also can acquire higher semantic information according to concurrence change. We present the actor correlation mining results in a graph-based interface to enable efficient users' navigation and search.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel standard variance feature is proposed for background modeling in dynamic scenes involving waving trees and ripples in water. The standard variance feature is the standard variance of a set of pixels' feature values, which captures mainly co-occurrence statistics of neighboring pixels in an image patch. The background modeling method based on standard variance feature includes two main components. First, we divide image into patches and represent each image patch as a standard variance feature. Then, assuming that standard variance feature fits a mixture of Gaussians distribution, we use mixture of Gaussians models to model it. Experimental results on several challenging video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

We propose a Spatial InteGrated Matching Association algorithm (SIGMA) for logo detection in natural scene that contains extremely variances in viewpoints, illuminations and occlusions. Our SIGMA algorithm consists of two phases: the Spatial InteGrated (SIG) phase and the Matching Association (MA) phase. The SIG phase integrates spatial correlations in feature representation, while the MA phase improves the matching performance by ordering an optimized matching sequence. We have collected a logo dataset containing 2,400 photos with 12 logo categories from Flickr, and experimental results demonstrate that the performance of proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the dataset.",

In this paper, we answer this question by analyzing distribution laws for keywords from image descriptions and comparing with traditional techniques in NLP, thereby propose three assumptions: Sparse Distribution Attribute, Local Convergent Assumption and Global Convergent Conjecture. They are essential for keywords selection and image content understanding to overcome the semantic gap. Experiments are performed on a 60,000 web crawled images, and the correctness is validated by the performance.",

The image's visual features and DCT coefficients of sub-region were utilized to select the watermark embedding locations. Moreover the mechanism of JND(just-noticeable distortion) was used to adjust the embedding strength of proposed algorithm. These components may be then used as building blocks to construct a self-adaptive content dependent spread spectrum watermark solution. Experimental results have been shown that the performance of the proposed strategy can resist effectively two types of linear collusion attacks while still being robust, stable and imperceptible.",

Algebraic relations between the matrix representation of the dual conic and the circular point enveloped are extensively analyzed, to attain a generalized framework for the problem. The dual conic has the decomposition with consistent geometric interpretation from which the circular point envelope can be solved. From the geometric viewpoint, based on the characteristics of the common elements of dual conics (their bitangents), a stratified approach is presented to establish the solution. Experiments on both synthetic and real images are conducted to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the presented approach.",

      "abstract": "In content-based video understanding, actor association can usually capture the high-level semantics, which is also the focus of user's browsing and searching attention. Mining actor correlations is of great importance but left unexplored until recently. However, due to the complex actor relationships in videos, building and quantifying character correlations to reflect significant concurrent scenarios meets great challenges. In this paper, we report our work on actor correlation search and mining, in which we present a context-based actor correlations graph search framework for TV series. Our framework serves as a first attempt for effective actor association concurrence search. Firstly, we leverage face detection and tracking to locate actors and generate multi-pose face sets, and adopt 2D-PCA detector and centered nearest neighbor to cluster faces. We then achieve actor indexing with manually adjustment to ensure extreme precision. Secondly, to measure the actor association into a unified graph, we propose a context-based correlation analysis strategy in shot sequence. Considering video structure cues, a hierarchical concurrence measurement is proposed to further train the actor association graph. We have deployed our proposed framework onto an online actor correlation search system, VisualCor, which could be viewed as a visualized, content-based simulation of the Renlifang search engine. It contains an actor correlation graph interface to facilitate character association search and browsing in Friends soap operas (containing over 20 hours videos) with excellent ranking accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to reveal human perception.",

      "abstract": "Traditional background subtraction methods perform poorly when scenes contain dynamic backgrounds such as waving tree branches, spouting fountain, illumination changes, camera jitters, etc. In this paper, from the view of spatial context, we present a novel and effective dynamic background method with three contributions. First, we present a novel local dependency descriptor, called local dependency histogram (LDH), to effectively model the spatial dependencies between a pixel and its neighboring pixels. The spatial dependencies contain substantial evidence for differentiating dynamic background regions from moving objects of interest. Second, based on the proposed LDH, an effective approach to dynamic background subtraction is proposed, in which each pixel is modeled as a group of weighted LDHs. Labeling a pixel as foreground or background is done by comparing the LDH computed in current frame against its model LDHs. The model LDHs are adaptively updated by the current LDH. Finally, unlike traditional approaches using a fixed threshold to judge whether a pixel matches to its model, an adaptive thresholding technique is also proposed. Experimental results on a diverse set of dynamic scenes validate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods for dynamic background subtraction.",

In this paper, we present a novel background subtraction approach for dynamic scenes, in which the background is modeled in a multi-resolution framework. First, for each level of the pyramid, we run an independent mixture of Gaussians Models (GMM) that outputs a background subtraction map. Second, these background subtraction maps are combined via AND operator to finally get a more robust and accurate background subtraction map. This is a natural fusion because the original resolution and low resolution images have complementary strengths, which original resolution image contains rich information and low resolution image is insensitive to the noises and the small movement of dynamic scene. Experimental result shows that this real-time algorithm is able to detect moving objects accurately even in dynamic scenes.",

We divide image into patches and represent each image patch as a NIPE vector. Then, the background model of each image patch is constructed as a group of weighted adaptive NIPE vectors. The NIPE feature vector, whose components are similarities between current image patch and its neighbors, describes mainly the mutual relationship between neighboring patches. Since neighboring image patches tend to be similarly affected by environmental effects (e.g., dynamic background), the NIPE vectors are more robust in these conditions comparing with the conventional method. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed NIPE method.",

Discovering, extracting, and summarizing knowledge from these data enables us to make better sense of the world. In this paper, we report our work on mining famous city landmarks from blogs for personalized tourist suggestions. Our main contribution is a graph modeling framework to discover city landmarks by mining blog photo correlations with community supervision. This modeling fuses context, content, and community information in a style that simulates both static (PageRank) and dynamic (HITS) ranking models to highlight representative data from the consensus of blog users.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to be satisfied for automatic photo assessment using only low level visual features such as brightness, lighting, hue, contrast, color distribution and so on. Instead of using low level visual features, we present a novel computational visual attention model to assess photos. Firstly, a face-sensitive saliency map analysis is deployed to estimate attention distribution. Then, a Rate of Focused Attention (RFA) measurement is proposed to quantify photo quality. By integrating top-down supervision into the visual attention model, we further achieve personalized photo assessment to take user preference into quality evaluation, which can be extended into object or semantic oriented photo assessment scenarios. Experiments on personal photo albums with comparison to ground-truth user evaluations demonstrate the effeteness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the architecture of our location sensitive indexing model which is used in a platform designed to deliver advertisements to users who primarily utilize images as queries instead of textual keywords. The indexing model facilitates an advertiser's ability to bid on images, such as billboards or logos, in order to obtain user feedback in judging image attractiveness. Additionally, the model enables automatic evaluation of advertisement popularity by mining users' query logs, which is critical for generating advertisement recommendations. The location sensitive architecture of this model enables effective and efficient functionality in large-scale scenarios. In the model's structure, our Location Sensitive Visual Indexing model (LSVI) incorporates location information that subdivides geographical regions for precise and localized image matching. By collecting feedback from mobile users, location-based mining can also help discover popular advertisements as well as their representative images. We have deployed our platform into a real-world advertising system in Beijing, China, which demonstrates effective results in comparative studies with both alternative and state-of-the-art approaches.",

In this paper, we answer this question by presenting a complete set framework for image annotation, which is motivated by the existence of semantic ontology. To generate this set, we propose a cross model optimization strategy from both textual and visual information for topic decomposition, based on a so-called Bipartite LSA model, which minimize multimodal error energy functions in a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis model. To achieve complete set based annotation, we present a Gaussian-Kernel-Generative process based keyword generation procedure, which analogizes keyword annotation in a probabilistic generative manner. A group of experiments is performed on Washington University image database and 80,000 Flickr images with comparisons to the state-of-the-arts. Finally, potential advantages and future improvements of our framework are discussed outside the scope of topic modeling.",

      "abstract": "Scalable image retrieval systems usually involve hierarchical quantization of local image descriptors, which produces a visual vocabulary for inverted indexing of images. Although hierarchical quantization has the merit of retrieval efficiency, the resulting visual vocabulary representation usually faces two crucial problems: (1) hierarchical quantization errors and biases in the generation of \"visual words\"; (2) the model cannot adapt to database variance. In this paper, we describe an unsupervised optimization strategy in generating the hierarchy structure of visual vocabulary, which produces a more effective and adaptive retrieval model for large-scale search. We adopt a novel Density-based Metric Learning (DML) algorithm, which corrects word quantization bias without supervision in hierarchy optimization, based on which we present a hierarchical rejection chain for efficient online search based on the vocabulary hierarchy. We also discovered that by hierarchy optimization, efficient and effective transfer of a retrieval model across different databases is feasible. We deployed a large-scale image retrieval system using a vocabulary tree model to validate our advances. Experiments on UKBench and street-side urban scene databases demonstrated the effectiveness of our hierarchy optimization approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.",

However, there is also spatial variation in real word due to dynamic background such as waving trees, spouting fountain and camera jitters, which causes the significant performance degradation of traditional methods. In this paper, a novel spatial-temporal nonparametric background subtraction approach (STNBS) is proposed to effectively handle dynamic background by modeling the spatial and temporal variations simultaneously. Specially, for each pixel in an image, we adaptively maintain a sample consisting of pixels observed in previous frames. At current frame, for a particular pixel, the proposed method estimates the probabilities of observing this pixel based on samples of its neighboring pixels. The pixel is labeled as background if one of these estimated probabilities is larger than a fixed threshold. All samples are adaptively updated over time. Experimental results on several challenging sequences show that the proposed method achieves the best performance than two state-of-the-art algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The goal of steganography is to hide information into media without disclosing the fact of existing communication. Currently, stganography such as least significant bit (LSB), quantization index modulation (QIM) and spread spectrum (SS), has become increasingly widespread. Steganalysis as a counterpart of stganography is to detect the presence of it. In this paper, we present a new universal steganalysis method based on statistical models of the imagepsilas discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. In fact, the block-based DCT by proper reorganization of its coefficients can have similar characteristics to wavelet transforms. The presented universal steganalysis method utilizes these characteristics to build statistical models of the image and its prediction-error image. Features extracted from the re-organization DCT blocks of host images and theirs prediction-error images and features extracted from steg images and theirs prediction-error images are used to train the SVM classifier. In the testing, features from those potential images are inputted the trained-well classifier to determine where the potential images are stego images or not. The experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms in general prior-arts of steganalysis methods based on wavelet transform domain.",

      "abstract": "Most existing approaches on sports video analysis have concentrated on semantic event detection. Sports professionals, however, are more interested in tactic analysis to help improve their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract tactic information from the attack events in broadcast soccer video and present the events in a tactic mode to the coaches and sports professionals. We extract the attack events with far-view shots using the analysis and alignment of web-casting text and broadcast video. For a detected event, two tactic representations, aggregate trajectory and play region sequence, are constructed based on multi-object trajectories and field locations in the event shots. Based on the multi-object trajectories tracked in the shot, a weighted graph is constructed via the analysis of temporal-spatial interaction among the players and the ball. Using the Viterbi algorithm, the aggregate trajectory is computed based on the weighted graph. The play region sequence is obtained using the identification of the active field locations in the event based on line detection and competition network. The interactive relationship of aggregate trajectory with the information of play region and the hypothesis testing for trajectory temporal-spatial distribution are employed to discover the tactic patterns in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework. Extensive experiments on FIFA World Cup 2006 show that the proposed approach is highly effective.",

Our algorithm combines a per-pixel with a per-region background model in a hierarchical manner, which accentuates the advantages of each. This is a natural combination because the two models have complementary strengths. The per-pixel background model is achieved by mixture of Gaussians Models (GMM) with RGB feature. Although precisely describing background change in high resolution, it suffers from the sensitivity to quick variations in dynamic environment. To tolerate these quick variations, we further develop a novel GMM based per-region background model, which is updated by the cluster centers obtained from a k-means clustering of the pixels' RGB feature in the region. Numerical and qualitative experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.",

This approach utilizes the characteristics of concentric circles' tangent lines to locate the center of these circles, and finds the geometric constraints for calibration based on the orthogonality formed by a point on the circle and the two intersected points of the circle with the line through the center of the circle. The entire process requires no conic equation fitting and no metric measurement of the test pattern, which is very flexible to implement.",

      "abstract": "Fusion of visual content with textual information is an effective way for both content-based and keyword-based image retrieval. However, the performance of visual & textual fusion is affected greatly by the data noise and redundancy in both text (such as surrounding text in HTML pages) and visual (such as intra-class diversity) aspects. This paper presents a manifold-based cross-media optimization scheme to achieve visual & textual fusion within a unified framework. Cross-Media manifold co-training mechanism between Keyword-based Metric Space and Vision-Based Metric Space is proposed creatively to infer a best dual-space fusion by minimizing manifold-based visual & textual energy criterion. We present the Isomorphic Manifold Learning to map the annotation affection in image visual space onto keyword semantic space by manifold shrinkage. We also demonstrate its correctness and convergence from mathematical perspective. The retrieval can be performed using both keyword or sample images respectively on Keyword-Based Metric Space and Vision-Based Metric Space, while the simple distance classifiers will satisfy. Two groups of experiments are conducted: The first group is carried on Corel 5000 image database to validate our effectiveness by comparing with state-of-the-art Generalized Manifold Ranking Based Image Retrieval and SVM. The second group is done over real-world Flickr dataset with over 6,000 images to testify our effectiveness in real-world application. The promising results show that our model attains a significant improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.",

This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework for efficient place retrieval in movies and sitcoms. We leverage face detection to filter out close-up frames from video dataset, and adopt saliency map analysis to partition background places from foreground actions. Consequently, we extract pyramid-based spatial-encoding correlogram from shot key frames for robust place representation. For effectively describing variant place appearances, we cluster key frames and model inter-cluster belonging of identical place by inside-shot association. Then hierarchical normalized cut is utilized over the association graph to differentiate physical places within videos and gain their multi-view representation as a tree structure. For efficient place matching in large-scale database, inversed indexing is applied onto the hierarchical graph structure, based on which approximate nearest neighbor search is proposed to largely accelerate search process. Experimental results on over 36-hour Friends sitcom database demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and semantic revealing ability of our framework.",

      "abstract": "From visual perception viewpoint, actions in videos can capture high-level semantics for video content understanding and retrieval. However, action-level video retrieval meets great challenges, due to the interferences from global motions or concurrent actions, and the difficulties in robust action describing and matching. This paper presents a content-based action retrieval framework to enable effective search of near-duplicated actions in large-scale video database. Firstly, we present an attention shift model to distill and partition human-concerned saliency actions from global motions and concurrent actions. Secondly, to characterize each saliency action, we extract 3D-SIFT descriptor within its spatial-temporal region, which is robust against rotation, scale, and view point variances. Finally, action similarity is measured using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to offer tolerance for action duration variance and partial motion missing. Search efficiency in large-scale dataset is achieved by hierarchical descriptor indexing and approximate nearest-neighbor search. In validation, we present a prototype system VILAR to facilitate action search within \"Friends\" soap operas with excellent accuracy, efficiency, and human perception revealing ability.",

These methods will perform poorly in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a solution to this problem. We first extend the local binary patterns from spatial domain to spatio-temporal domain, and present a new online dynamic texture extraction operator, named spatio-temporal local binary patterns (STLBP). Then we present a novel and effective method for dynamic background modeling and subtraction using STLBP. In the proposed method, each pixel is modeled as a group of STLBP dynamic texture histograms which combine spatial texture and temporal motion information together. Compared with traditional methods, experimental results show that the proposed method adapts quickly to the changes of the dynamic background. It achieves accurate detection of moving objects and suppresses most of the false detections for dynamic changes of nature scenes.",

      "abstract": "Up to now, the major problem for large vocabulary sign language recognition lies in the huge search space due to a variety of recognition classes. Analytical methods such as dynamic time wrapping (DTW) or Euclidian distance have been used for isolated word recognition, but the performance is not satisfactory enough because it is easily interfered by noise. Statistical methods, especially hidden Markov Models are commonly used for both continuous sign language and isolated words while the processing time becomes increasingly unacceptable with the expansion of vocabulary. A multilayer architecture of sign language recognition is proposed in this paper for the purpose of speeding up the search process. The gesture sequence to be recognized is first located at a set of words that are easy to be confused (confusion set) through a global cursory search with little computation cost and then the gesture is recognized through a local search. The generation of confusion set is realized by DTW/ISODATA algorithm. Experiment results indicate that it is an effective algorithm for sign language recognition with large vocabulary.",

In the algorithm, the watermark is embedded in the DCT coefficients of I frames and P frames. This algorithm adopts the re-embedding and optimal retrieving strategy to guarantee the synchronization between embedding and retrieving watermark, and improve the robustness of watermarking. Experimental results show that this algorithm has obvious low complexity, high watermark payload and the strong robustness against re-encoding, multiple re-encoding and deleting.",

Our proposed framework enables incremental indexing of vocabulary tree model, which efficiently includes new data into model refinement without re-generating entire model from overall dataset. An adaption trigger criterion is presented to lessen system computational cost, which is achieved by density-based relative entropy estimation between original dataset and newly coming data. Experiments on Seattle urban scene datasets with over 20K street-side images show the effectiveness of our work.",

However, the assumption of frame independence in HMM makes it inconsistent with the characteristic of strong temporal correlation in sign language signals. Polynomial Segment Model (PSM) explicitly represents the temporal evolution of sign language features as a Gaussian process with time-varying parameters. In this paper PSM is first introduced to SLR framework to solve the temporal correlation problem. Considering the correlation among the coefficients of polynomial trajectorypsilas different orders, Mahalanobis distance is used as the classification criterion to evaluate the likelihood of test data. Experimental results show that our method outperform the conventional HMM methods by 6.81% in recognition accuracy.",

      "abstract": "A dilemma, caused by data variation, exists in research into signer-independent sign language recognition. An effective way to solve this dilemma, and thereby help push the research forward, is to understand sign language from the perspectives of human kinesics and linguistics. This paper, based on the principles of movement observation science, specifically Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), presents a summary of the factors causing sign language data variation, proposes the definition of, and a method for describing, sign language effort elements, and then provides a strategy for standardizing signer-independent sign language data. The standardized data are to be used for training and recognition. The method presented in this paper has been assessed under different experimental conditions, and the results show that the recognition accuracy is greatly increased.",

      "abstract": "Automatic Linguistic Annotation is a promising solution to bridge the semantic gap in content-based image retrieval. However, two crucial issues are not well addressed in state-of-art annotation algorithms: 1. The <i>Small Sample Size (3S)</i> problem in keyword classifier/model learning; 2. Most of annotation algorithms can not extend to real-time online usage due to their low computational efficiencies. This paper presents a novel <i>Manifold-based Biased Fisher Discriminant Analysis (MBFDA)</i> algorithm to address these two issues by transductive semantic learning and keyword filtering. To address the <i>3S</i> problem, Co-Training based Manifold learning is adopted for keyword model construction. To achieve real-time annotation, a <i>Bias Fisher Discriminant Analysis (BFDA)</i> based semantic feature reduction algorithm is presented for keyword confidence discrimination and semantic feature reduction. Different from all existing annotation methods, <i>MBFDA</i> views image annotation from a novel <i>Eigen</i> semantic feature (which corresponds to keywords) selection aspect. As demonstrated in experiments, our <i>manifold-based biased Fisher discriminant analysis</i> annotation algorithm outperforms classical and state-of-art annotation methods (1.K-NN Expansion; 2.One-to-All SVM; 3.PWC-SVM) in both computational time and annotation accuracy with a large margin.",

      "abstract": "Most of existing approaches on event detection in sports video are general audience oriented. The extracted events are then presented to the audience without further analysis. However, professionals, such as soccer coaches, are more interested in the tactics used in the events. In this paper, we present a novel approach to extract tactic information from the goal event in broadcast soccer video and present the goal event in a tactic mode to the coaches and sports professionals. We first extract goal events with far-view shots based on analysis and alignment of web-casting text and broadcast video. For a detected goal event, we employ a multi-object detection and tracking algorithm to obtain the players and ball trajectories in the shot. Compared with existing work, we proposed an effective tactic representation called aggregate trajectory which is constructed based on multiple trajectories using a novel analysis of temporal-spatial interaction among the players and the ball. The interactive relationship with play region information and hypothesis testing for trajectory temporal-spatial distribution are exploited to analyze the tactic patterns in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework. The experimental results on the data of FIFA World Cup 2006 are promising and demonstrate our approach is effective.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel visual & textual information fusion framework for region-based image retrieval. We explore the issue of linguistic-integrated region retrieval from both Bayesian Reasoning and Fuzzy Region Matching aspects. Firstly, to associate textual information with image regions, we present a region-based soft annotation strategy. Our method automatically labels each image region with multiple keywords, each of which is assigned a confidence factor to indicate its annotation accuracy. In annotation classifier training, we adopt a pairwise coupling (PWC) SVM bagging network to address the problems of sample insufficiency and sample asymmetry. Consequently, in image retrieval, we fuse regions. visual & textual information to rank image similarities at perceptual level. Two fusion schemes are explored in proposed framework: 1. Semantic-Supervised Integrated Region Matching (SSIRM); 2. Keyword-Integrated Bayesian Reasoning (KIBR). SSIRM is a keyword-integrated fuzzy region matching strategy, which is adopted in the case that the query image is pre-annotated; KIBR is adopted in the case that the query image is non-annotated or poorly-annotated, which supports both query-by-example and query-by-keyword based on statistical text-image translation model. Finally, in relevance feedback (RF) learning, we exploit a unified visual & textual learning algorithm to precisely capture users' retrieval intention. Superior annotation, retrieval (over IRM) and RF performances (Both over IRM + SVM at region-level and SVM & ALSVM & ABSVM at global-level) are presented in our experiments, which demonstrate the efficiency of proposed fusion framework to bridge the semantic gap.",

      "abstract": "The majority of existing work on sports video analysis concentrates on highlight extraction. Little work focuses on the important issue as how the extracted highlights should be organized. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach to organize the highlights extracted from racket sports video grounded on human behavior analysis using a nonlinear affective ranking model. Two research challenges of highlight ranking are addressed, namely affective feature extraction and ranking model construction. The basic principle of affective feature extraction in our work is to extract sensitive features which can stimulate user's emotion. Since the users pay most attention to player behavior and audience response in racket sport highlights, we extract affective features from player behavior including action and trajectory, and game-specific audio keywords. We propose a novel motion analysis method to recognize the player actions. We employ support vector regression to construct the nonlinear highlight ranking model from affective features. A new subjective evaluation criterion is proposed to guide the model construction. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, we have tested them on more than ten-hour broadcast tennis and badminton videos. The experimental results demonstrate that our action recognition approach significantly outperforms the existing appearance-based method. Moreover, our user study shows that the affective highlight ranking approach is effective.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem that relevance feedback schemes based on support vector machines (RF-SVM) always give a poor performance when the numbers of positive/negative feedback examples are strongly asymmetric. To address this issue, we propose a random sampling SVM based query expansion for relevance feedback learning. Firstly, we adopt a random sampling method to construct multiple asymmetric bagging SVM classifiers (hard or binary SVM each) and aggregate them to form a compound SVM classifier by classifier committee voting. Subsequently, the voting results are combined with query expansion to sort the final feedback ranking results. The proposed method can effectively restrain the negative effect of the sample asymmetry. Thus it provides a good error-tolerant ability to training data. Experimental results on a subset of COREL image database demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.",

It clusters images to numbers of classes automatically, according to human perception. It utilized HSV histograms, wavelet texture features, color-texture moments, a gray gradient co-occurrence matrix, and hierarchical distribution features, to put similar semantic images into the same set. The algorithm was effectively proven by experiments for automatic image clustering, for the clustering image categories have semantically similar properties. It could organize image database efficiency so as to improve image retrieval.",

It clusters images to numbers of classes automatically, according to human perception. It utilized HSV histograms, wavelet texture features, color-texture moments, a gray gradient co-occurrence matrix, and hierarchical distribution features, to put similar semantic images into the same set. The algorithm was effectively proven by experiments for automatic image clustering, for the clustering image categories have semantically similar properties. It could organize image database efficiency so as to improve image retrieval.",

To address this problem, we propose a method to embed adaptive feature selection into mean shift tracking framework. From a feature set, the most discriminative features are selected after ranking these features based on their Bayes error rates, which are estimated from object and background samples. For the selected features, a criterion is proposed to evaluate their stability for tracking and to guide feature reselection. The selected features are used to generate a weight image, in which mean shift is employed to locate the object. Moreover, a simple yet effective scale adaptation method is proposed to deal with object changing in size. Experiments on several video sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a PCA based method to reduce the dimensionality of DCT coefficients for visual only lip-reading systems. A three-stage pixel based visual front end is adopted. First, DCT or block-based DCT features are extracted. Second, Principal Component Analysis is applied for dimension reduction. Finally, all the feature vectors are normalized into a uniform scale. This work investigates this three-stage method, comparing with PCA and two DCT based approaches whose features are selected manually. In the latter manner, PCA coefficients are selected according to energy while the reduction of DCT coefficients leans to the left components in the left-top corner. Experiments prove that the dimension reduction task based on PCA does improve the recognition accuracy when the final dimension is below a certain value. They also show that DCT and block-based DCT work similarly for lip reading task, outperforming PCA slightly.",

To overcome this drawback, we present an optimal block mapping LSB method based on genetic algorithm, which is out of researchers? concern but fundamentally important. Additionally we discuss the rule to select the best block size. The main idea is to minimize the degradation of the stego image by finding a best mapping function between host and secret image blocks at global scope. The experimental result is promising. The advantage of our method over most commonly used LSB strategy is obvious in enhancing PSNR value while having a secluded statistic peculiarity.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we focus on the detection of spread spectrum steganography, especially in the case that the scaling parameters are adaptive to image content. Our contribution is two folds. Firstly, we present a new steganalysis method for adaptive spread spectrum steganography: block-based scatter difference detection. Our algorithm first restores cover image by restoring filter. Then the embedding process is simulated in both test and cover images for certain times and the statistic in local DCT block is calculated as a criterion for classification. Secondly, we propose a region estimation algorithm to estimate the most likely stego regions. Our experiment result is promising by showing hits over 90% and false alarm lower than 10%. Its simplicity and extensibility indicate its further application in watermark detection.",

The algorithm uses the geometry of the visual hull to compute voxel normals and visibilities. Then a photometric consistency field (PCF) is computed, which describes the photometric consistency score of every voxel. The visual hull is refined in a view dependent fashion. For each view, we compute a view dependent PCF (VDPCF) by resampling the PCF and then find an optimal depth image in VDPCF with graph cut based energy minimization, which takes into consideration data, smoothness and adjustment terms simultaneously. The depth images are used for carving voxels. Our algorithm can produce precise models with a moderate speed.",

To speed up the recognition process, we present a method using one-pass (OP) pre-searching before Viterbi recognition. The experiments are processed in the large vocabulary database. Results show that the average recognition speed of OP/Viterbi approach can get a notable raise comparing with the single frame's without reducing too much recognition accuracy",

      "abstract": "As a new unsupervised learning method, manifold learning is capturing increasing interests of researchers in the field of machine learning and cognitive sciences. To understand manifold learning better, the topology concept of manifold learning was presented firstly, and then its development history was traced. Based on different representations of manifold, several major algorithms were introduced, whose advantages and defects were pointed out respectively. After that, two kinds of typical applications of Isomap and LLE were indicated. The results show that compared with traditional linear method, manifold learning can discover the intrinsic dimensions of nonlinear high-dimensional data effectively, helping researchers to reduce dimensionality and analyze data better. Finally the prospect of manifold learning was discussed, so as to extend the application area of manifold learning.",

The algorithm first partitions the space with a set of infinite triangular pyramids derived from a geodesic sphere. Then the pyramids are cut by silhouettes into a set of pentahedrons, which together constitute the centripetal pentahedron model of the visual hull. This process is accelerated by precomputed polar silhouette graphs (PSGs) and reduced PSGs. Finally a mesh surface model is extracted by marching pentahedrons. Our algorithm has the advantages of robustness, speediness and preciseness.",

It is a signer-independent method, to recognize Chinese sign language with large vocabulary using multilayer architecture classifier and making use of the advantages both of HMM (hidden Markov model) and SVM (support vector machines). Because HMM is good at dealing with sequential inputs, while SVM shows superior performance in classifying with good generalization properties especially for limited samples. Therefore, they can be combined to yield a better and effective multilayer architecture classifier. We apply SVMs to resolve the uncertainties of the remaining which are in confusable sets after the first-stage HMM-based recognizer. And the confusable sets would be updated dynamically according to the results of a recognition performance to optimize the discernment performance next time. Experimental results proved that it is an effective method for CSLR with large vocabulary keywords sign language recognition, HMM, SVM, multilayer architecture classifier.",

      "abstract": "In traditional watermark detection, a prover exposes the secret information that can be used to remove the watermark to the possible dishonest verifier in order to prove a watermark presents in a digital data. This is a significant security risk because a potential attacker is able to remove the watermark once secret information like watermark or embedding key is known. Some of previous schemes proposed as solution haven't achieved desirable result really. Their lacking of security and validity is the most severe problem. In this paper, we propose the watermark detection schemes with high security, which are based on zero knowledge protocol and public-key encryption scheme, for both blind watermark scheme and non-blind watermark scheme. These two schemes provide copyright proving without revealing any information that can be used for removing watermark during the detection process. Both security and validity of watermark detection can be significantly improved using these two schemes.",

      "abstract": "We introduce homogeneous coordinates to represent support vector machines (SVMs) and develop a corresponding training algorithm: single sequential minimal optimization (SSMO). By this simple trick (homogeneous coordinates representation), linear constrains will not appear in quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. So unlike the most popular used SVM training algorithm sequential minimal optimization (SMO) which solves the QP subproblem containing minimal two Lagrange multipliers, SSMO can analytically update only one Lagrange multiplier at every step. Because of avoiding double loops in heuristically choosing the two Lagrange multipliers in SMO, both CPU time and iterations can be decreased greatly. Experiments on MNIST database, under mild KKT conditions accuracy requirement, shows SSMO can be more than 2 times faster than SMO.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel blind video watermarking method based on the stability of the direct current (DC) coefficient values in blocks transformed by discrete cosine transform (DCT). The frame is randomly selected to embed watermark, and then its luminance is blocked by 8-by-8 and transformed by DCT. The watermark is embedded in the high frequency coefficient of some consecutive DC coefficients which have been transformed by DCT. During the detection process, the correlation between the watermark and the high frequency coefficients of the DC coefficients transformed by DCT is computed to judge whether the frame has been embedded watermark. The experimental results indicate that the correlation curve peaks emerge at the watermarked I frames and P frames which suffered MPEG-4 and H.264 compression. The proposed watermarking method has strong robustness against some attacks such as frame deleting, frame inserting, frame shifting, frame statistical average and collusion attack.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present an active volumetric model (AVM) for 3D reconstruction from multiple calibrated images of a scene. The AVM is a physically motivated 3D deformable model which shrinks actively under the influence of multiple simulated forces towards the real scene by throwing away some of its voxels. It provides a computational framework to integrate several constraints in an intelligible way. In the current work, we use three forces derived respectively from the smooth constraint, the compulsory silhouette constraint, and the color consistency constraint. Based on the composition of the 3 forces, our algorithm can significantly restrain holes and floating voxels, which plague voxel coloring algorithms, and produce precise and smooth models. We test our algorithm by experiments based on both synthetic and real data.",

However, due to large vocabulary of the sign language, traditional one-layer HMM method is becoming limited with the increasing number of training samples. It is tardy when recognizing which cannot meet the real time requirement. In this paper, we present a multi-resolution feature extracting method and a reducing dimension method of maximum variance criterion (MVC), which has better performance in sign language recognition system than traditional reducing dimension methods of PCA or ICA. Our multilayer sign language recognition system increases the recognition accuracy by 3.42%, as well as reduces the recognition time by 0.992 second in average, compared with traditional HMM based system.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we present an adaptive dandelion model for reconstructing spherical terrain-like visual hull (VH) surfaces. The dandelion model represents a solid by a pencil of organized line segments emitted from a common point. The directions and the topology of the line segments are derived from the triangle facets of a geodesic sphere, which are recursively subdivided until the desired precision is achieved. The initial lines are cut by silhouettes in 2D and then lifted back to 3D to determine the ending points of the line segments defining sampling points on the spherical terrain-like VH surface. A mesh model can be easily constructed from the dandelion model. Our algorithm has the advantages of controllable precision, adaptive resolution, simplicity and speediness. We validate our algorithm by theories and experiments.",

      "abstract": "While many researchers have documented methods for recognizing sign language from instrumented gloves with high accuracy, these systems suffer from notable limitations: device-dependence and lack of extensibility. An ideal recognition system should be able to switch among a variety of input devices without retraining the entire system. A bidirectional self-organizing feature maps (BSOFMs) is presented in this paper to address this problem. BSOFMs has the ability to convert the vector from different input spaces with heterogeneous representation into one in a unique feature space and enable us to get the same description. In the training process, the raw data produced by different gloves work as input and ideal output alternately. Then the device-dependent description of the hand shape is converted to the compact feature output in the device independent feature space. Based on these models, the incorporation of BSOFMs and the existing recognition framework is introduced and it is crucial to creating a useful device-independent system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has an ideal performance in device-independent application.",

This method solves the overlap problem of sample space, and improves the performance of recognition by strengthening training the samples that are difficult to be classified correctly. The method mentioned above, improves the change rate of the samples' weights in the iteration process, reduces the updating speed of samples' weights; and it can distinguish noisy samples, and reduces the weights of unreasonable weak classifiers, so that the improved algorithm suffers less influence of noisy data on strong classifier.",

      "abstract": "Up to now analytical or statistical methods have been used in sign language recognition with large vocabulary. Analytical methods such as Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) or Euclidian distance have been used for isolated word recognition, but the performance is not satisfactory enough because it is easily interfered by noise. Statistical methods, especially hidden Markov Models are commonly used, for both continuous sign language and isolated words and with the expansion of vocabulary the processing time becomes increasingly unacceptable. Therefore, a multilayer architecture of sign language recognition for large vocabulary is proposed in this paper for the purpose of speeding up the recognition process. In this method the gesture sequence to be recognized is first located at a set of words that are easy to be confused (confusion set) through a global cursory search and then the gesture is recognized through a latter local search and the generation of confusion set is realized by DTW/ISODATA algorithm. Experiment results indicate that it is an effective algorithm for Chinese sign language recognition.",

In this paper, we propose a new approach to embed a watermark that is to modify the block average in wavelet domain. If the watermarked image has been attacked by geometric ways, we can figure it out by Zernike transform and then retrieve it. Experiments prove that the method is not only robust to geometric attacks, but also to JPEG and Checkmark attacks.",

Then the occurrence of pixel-values in each group is counted and sorted in monotone increasing. Finally, a bitplane-wise data hiding method is used to hide data in cover image. The worst-square-error between the stego-image and the cover-image is formulated. Theory analysis indicates that image quality of the stego-image hidden by this method can improve from 0 db to 4 db against simple LSB (least significant bit) substitution method. Experimental results show that the stego-image is visually indistinguishable from the original cover-image.",

This creates a potential problem when this technology is misused for planning criminal activities. In this paper, a new steganalysis technique is proposed on the basis of histogram analysis on the wavelet coefficients for the detection the very existence of wavelet domain information hiding techniques. And our approach lays particular stress on methods in which secret message was embedded via quantizating wavelet coefficients. Different statistical discrepancies are obtained by histogram analysis of sub-band wavelet coefficients from stego-images and innocent images. And FFT of these discrepancies are used to form a quantitative criterion to determine whether an image has been embedded secret message or not. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is comparable to previously existing techniques.",

Wavelet coefficients in each sub-band of wavelet transform are modeled as a Generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) with two parameters. It appears that those parameters are a good measure of image features and can be used to discriminate stego-images from innocent images. Neural network is adopted to train these parameters to get the inherent characteristic of innocent and stego-images. These experimental results have proved that this method is applicable for the detection of information hiding techniques in wavelet, and the proposed algorithm is more effective to previously existing techniques.",

However excessive exploration would degrade the performance of Q/spl I.bar/learning and it is difficult to meet the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The active backup is introduced into Q/spl I.bar/learning and the corresponding algorithm AB/spl I.bar/Q/spl I.bar/learning based on Dijkstra backup in dynamic programming is proposed. Then, the memory mechanism based MEAB/spl I.bar/Q/spl I.bar/Iearning algorithm is given for the agent to learn in completely unknown environment. The experimental results show that these two algorithms not only converge more quickly, but also solve the problem of local optimization.",

      "abstract": "We constructed a simple and fast system to detect frontal human faces in complex environment. There are two main contributions of our work: 1) we use a fast image segmentation method based on connected components labelling to select candidate face areas; 2) we propose a positive-negative attractor template to examine face areas. A valley detector is used to search the valley-like points of eyes and mouths. We test the system on images in complex environment and with confusing objects. The experiment shows a robust detection result with few false detected faces.",

In this paper we propose a new method based neural network to get statistics features of images to identify the underlying hidden data. We first extract features of image embedded information, then input them into neural network to get output. And experiment results indicate this method is valid in steganalysis. This method will be used for Internet/network security, watermarking and so on.",

In this paper, an approach based on parameter sequences of the mouth shape model in binary images is put forward and realized, then we discuss several possible applications, especially in the case of integration of lipreading and speech. First of all, we preprocess the captured sequence of images, then make them binary with an automatic binary threshold algorithm, extract the contour of mouth shape, fitted with two parabolas. Finally, we recognize mouth shape with HMM models using the features from the parabolas. The results of the above indicate that the system is satisfactory.",

In other words, a new approach to making binary lip images with a deformable optimum threshold is presented. Using this approach makes the mouth object follow more closely the true shape of the mouth, and can improve the features from the image data. It is useful for improving the rate of recognition. The deformable optimum threshold technique and its application is introduced in this paper.",

Then, we introduce our three human face perception system which are based on eigen features-human face detection and tracking system, ID card photograph identification system and facial expression recognition system.",

      "abstract": "This paper has investigated the color facts in color images, obtained the relationship between chroma and color coordinates, and established a type of coordinate transform which is able to improve chroma of the skin and lip. With these coordinates, a new method of human face locating and tracking based on skin chroma and lip chroma transform in color images has been presented. It is effective and robust to detect the position of objects, not impacted by the pose of object and complexity of background. It is able to overcome the influence of illumination variance or different camera devices by on-line learning. This method is fast and stable. This algorithm is prerequisite for most human face perception system. By this approach, a feasible, reliable and real-time property algorithm to work out locating and tracking problem in real system is obtained.",
