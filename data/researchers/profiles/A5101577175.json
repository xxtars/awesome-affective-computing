    "trend_summary": "Kejun Zhang's research centers on affective computing with strong emphasis on multimodal emotion sensing, modeling, and generative application—especially at the intersection of music, video, physiology (e.g., EDA, EEG), and expressive language. A defining trend is the shift from passive emotion recognition toward active, real-time, context- and relationship-aware affective synthesis: e.g., AI-assisted human-pet musical co-creation, emotion-conditioned video-to-music generation, and wearables-powered pet communication. There is consistent attention to applied domains—wellness therapy, retail robotics, creative tools—and deep integration of psychological principles (e.g., emotional flow, synesthesia, memory resonance) into system design. Recent work increasingly unifies LLMs, diffusion models, and physiological signals within human-centered, cross-species, and therapeutic frameworks.",

      "abstract": "P2-type NaxLiyMn1–yO2 layered oxides represent a promising class of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, capable of delivering a high specific capacity by leveraging anionic redox reactions. However, their practical application is often hampered by issues such as Na+/vacancy ordering and irreversible oxygen release, which significantly impair the rate capability and cycling stability. To address the aforementioned problem, this work demonstrates that introducing trace La into P2–Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 fundamentally alters the Na+ distribution between Nae and Naf sites in the sodium layer and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering. More importantly, the high bond energy of La–O significantly enhances the stability of lattice oxygen, suppressing irreversible oxygen release during cycling and thereby simultaneously improving the reversibility of redox reactions and structural integrity. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the optimized LM-La0.04 cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 193.5 mAh g–1 at 0.2 C and retains a reversible capacity of 86.8 mAh g–1 even at 10 C, highlighting its superior rate performance. Furthermore, the material exhibits remarkable capacity retention in long-term cycling. A combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations was employed to elucidate the charge compensation mechanism and structural evolution of the La-doped system during electrochemical cycling. This work provides new insights into the regulatory role of lanthanum in layered oxides and offers a feasible doping strategy for developing anion-redox-based cathode materials with a high energy density and long cycling stability.",

      "abstract": "Video-to-music (V2M) generation aims to create music that aligns with visual content. However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons. Demo and code are available at https://Tayjsl97.github.io/Diff-V2M-Demo/.",

Current ultra‐high nickel cathodes fail to meet the commercial demands, owing to the structure degradation during cycle. Additionally, the dense structure of traditional secondary particles restricts the migration of Li + and further limits the capacity and rate performance. In this work, we focus on modulating intrinsic structure and morphology of cathodes originating from in situ growth method and have further controllably synthesized a special ultra‐high nickel cathode with gapped structure and thin surface rock‐salt phase (G‐Ni91). Compared to the traditional dense‐structure cathode (D‐Ni91), G‐Ni91 delivers better performance in all aspects, whether it is initial capacity, cycle stability, rate performance, high‐voltage operation, and high‐temperature condition. Multiscale characterizations manifests that smaller primary particle size, gapped interspace and less Li + /Ni 2+ antisite in G‐Ni91 supply enhanced Li + transport dynamics. Moreover, the thin surface rock‐salt phase and more uniform primary particles are regarded as contributions to the improved cycling stability. This work provides a feasible original intrinsic structural design and modification from precursor to cathodes, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance of ultra‐high nickel‐layered cathodes.",

      "abstract": "Singing accent research is underexplored compared to speech accent studies, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. Existing singing datasets often suffer from detail loss, frequently resulting from the vocal-instrumental separation process. Additionally, they often lack regional accent annotations. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Accent Mandarin Dry-Vocal Singing Dataset (MADVSD). MADVSD comprises over 670 hours of dry vocal recordings from 4,206 native Mandarin speakers across nine distinct Chinese regions. In addition to each participant recording audio of three popular songs in their native accent, they also recorded phonetic exercises covering all Mandarin vowels and a full octave range. We validated MADVSD through benchmark experiments in singing accent recognition, demonstrating its utility for evaluating state-of-the-art speech models in singing contexts. Furthermore, we explored dialectal influences on singing accent and analyzed the role of vowels in accentual variations, leveraging MADVSD's unique phonetic exercises.",

The system combines a cat vocal emotion recognition module, a personality-aware prompt generation engine powered by large language models, and a multimodal response interface comprising synthesized speech and textual feedback. Our emotion classifier achieves 92.09% accuracy on a 10-class feline vocalization dataset, operating at 0.0551× real-time. Responses are generated via structured prompting and delivered through a 26.6-gram wearable device with less than 3 second end-to-end latency. PetChat demonstrates a cognition-oriented interaction loop, embedding affective understanding and behavioral consistency into the human–pet interface. Future extensions will explore support for dog vocal emotion recognition and in-the-wild deployment with user studies.",

      "abstract": "AI-generated music may inadvertently replicate samples from the training data, raising concerns of plagiarism. Similarity measures can quantify such replication, thereby offering supervision and guidance for music generation models. Existing similarity measure methods for symbolic music mainly target melody repetition, leaving a gap in assessing complex music with rich textures and expressive performance characteristics. To address this gap, we introduce SSIMuse, the first adaptation of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) from images to symbolic music. Specifically, we represent symbolic music as image-like piano rolls in binary and velocity-based forms. Build upon these representations, we reinterprete and suitably modify the SSIM components in the musical context to develop two variants, i.e., SSIMuse-B and SSIMuse-V, for evaluating data replication in composition and dynamic performance, respectively. Controlled experiments on synthetic samples from multiple datasets show that SSIMuse can reliably detect exact replication at a granularity of at least one bar. SSIMuse enables open evaluation of replication in music generation and draws attention to its broader ethical, social, legal, and economic implications. The code is available at https://github.com/Tayjsl97/SSIMuse.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores AI-mediated human-pet musical co-creation from an interdisciplinary perspective, leveraging recent advancements in animal-assisted therapy. These advancements have shown significant psychosocial benefits, especially in reducing anxiety and enhancing social engagement. Building on these findings, this study innovatively employs pet vocal timbres as 'digital avatars' to enhance emotional investment during the music creation process. We propose PetCoCre, a novel system that applies pet vocal timbres in three distinct character paradigms within AI music creation: (1) PetRhythm: using pet voices as rhythmic percussion through beat synchronization. (2) PetMelody: enabling pet voices to act as melodic instruments via pitch-shifting alignment. (3) PetVocalia: utilizing pet vocal timbres as the target timbre for SVC (Singing Voice Conversion), where the converted singing voice replaces the original singer's voice, thus preserving the original semantic content. Beyond these character paradigms, our technical innovation lies in proposing SaMoye, the first open-source, high-quality zero-shot SVC model that effectively overcomes existing methods' zero-shot limitations by employing mixed speaker embeddings for timbre enhancement and leveraging a large-scale singing voice dataset. In our experiments, we collected dog and cat vocalization data from pet stores and conducted experiments with 30 participants. Results demonstrate that the human-pet co-creation mode led to significant enhancements in pleasure and creative satisfaction compared to solo AI music generation, along with a significant reduction in participants' anxiety levels. Through collaborative art creation, this research pioneers new paradigms for animal-assisted therapeutic interventions and expands the boundaries of AI-assisted creative collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The proliferation of networked devices, driven by advancements in the Internet of Things and edge computing technologies, has introduced significant challenges related to network security. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a dynamic reputation-based threshold anonymous credential protocol, which integrates multi-dimensional scenario-adaptive threshold decision-making, dynamic reputation assessment, and efficient distributed authentication mechanisms. The protocol's ability to dynamically adjust its authentication strategy is facilitated by the incorporation of both long-term and short-term reputation assessment models. This feature ensures that the protocol can adapt to the diverse characteristics of user behavior, thereby accommodating the varied requirements of different scenarios. The protocol also enhances security and fault tolerance during the authentication process through the application of threshold value and slice aggregation technology. In the specific implementation process, the protocol can effectively balance security and resource efficiency, which makes it especially suitable for environments with high-security requirements or limited resources. Experimental results demonstrated the protocol's superiority in various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance indicators. Additionally, it exhibited remarkable resilience and anti-attack capabilities in the face of malicious attacks. Future research endeavors can further optimize the computation and communication overheads and introduce more complex reputation assessment models to enhance the real-time and abnormal behavior prediction capabilities of the system.",

The objective of this model is to establish a decision framework that incorporates reliability, economy, and availability indices to enhance planned maintenance scheduling, optimize the selection mechanism for metro equipment maintenance strategies, and ensure that equipment operation and maintenance are economically viable. The research findings of this model demonstrate significant advantages over the previous singular maintenance system. It not only addresses the difficulties encountered in previous maintenance decisions but also reduces costs by 12.53% when compared with previous singular operational maintenance systems. By providing a scientific reference value, this model assists autonomous metro operating companies in achieving a balanced control between ensuring equipment reliability and improving maintenance cost-effectiveness",

      "abstract": "Abstract Lattice defect‐induced tuning of the chemical bonding environment is a promising strategy to enhance the performance of electrode materials. The deliberate introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in boosting electronic conductivity and ion diffusion kinetics, while the resultant chemical bond engineering optimizes the bonding environment, thereby enhancing structural stability and electrochemical reversibility. This study pioneers a dual‐modification strategy involving OVs ‐induced C‐P bonds formation in the Zn 2 P 2 O 7 structure. Through systematic electrochemical characterization complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the synergistic mechanism between OVs‐mediated electron structure modulation and C‐P bonds reinforcement is elucidated. As a novel anode material for sodium‐ion batteries, the engineered Zn 2 P 2 O 7−x @C composite exhibits substantially enhanced rate capability (316.6 mAh g −1 at 0.05 A g −1 ) and cycling stability (171.3 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g −1 ), in stark contrast to the rapid performance degradation observed in pristine Zn 2 P 2 O 7 . Furthermore, the extension of this strategy to lithium‐ion battery systems further validates the universal effectiveness of this defect/chemical bonding synergy strategy in improving alkali metal ions storage, demonstrating its broad applicability across various energy storage platforms.",

      "abstract": "With the widespread application of diffusion models in image restoration, font generation, and super-resolution, the demand for text generation capabilities within these models has significantly increased. However, most existing image generation approaches primarily focus on visual content, such as posters, without fully optimizing text generation, often resulting in inaccurate stroke structures and poor text layout. In this work, we propose a domain-specific large-scale model tailored for Chinese text generation, addressing both single-character and text layout generation tasks. Our approach leverages a diffusion-based architecture trained on high-quality Chinese text data, ensuring improved fidelity in character generation, stroke completeness, and layout accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively generates structured and visually coherent Chinese text, offering a novel solution to the challenges of Chinese text generation within diffusion models.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Data heterogeneity and performance disparities among heterogeneous models are critical challenges in federated learning with heterogeneous data and models, which limit its practical applicability and degrade local model performance. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data and Models Based on Global Decision Boundary Distillation (Fed-GDBD). For data heterogeneity, Fed-GDBD employs local prototype clustering to effectively capture and condense private data distribution information, and incorporates irrelevant-class knowledge distillation during local supervised learning to explicitly model the posterior relationships among classes, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting in local domains. To address model performance disparities, Fed-GDBD innovatively incorporates global decision boundary distillation. By maintaining an updated global decision boundary learner on the server, the approach optimizes local models from a global decision boundary perspective, reducing the impact of conflicting information. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of Fed-GDBD under non-convex objectives. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that Fed-GDBD outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods across various statistical heterogeneity settings and better adaptability to challenging scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Lyric-to-melody generation aims to automatically create melodies based on given lyrics, requiring the capture of complex and subtle correlations between them. However, previous works usually suffer from two main challenges: 1) lyric-melody alignment modeling, which is often simplified to one-syllable/word-to-one-note alignment, while others have the problem of low alignment accuracy; 2) lyric-melody harmony modeling, which usually relies heavily on intermediates or strict rules, limiting model's capabilities and generative diversity. In this paper, we propose SongGLM, a lyric-to-melody generation system that leverages 2D alignment encoding and multi-task pre-training based on the General Language Model (GLM) to guarantee the alignment and harmony between lyrics and melodies. Specifically, 1) we introduce a unified symbolic song representation for lyrics and melodies with word-level and phrase-level (2D) alignment encoding to capture the lyric-melody alignment; 2) we design a multi-task pre-training framework with hierarchical blank infilling objectives (n-gram, phrase, and long span), and incorporate lyric-melody relationships into the extraction of harmonized n-grams to ensure the lyric-melody harmony. We also construct a large-scale lyric-melody paired dataset comprising over 200,000 English song pieces for pre-training and fine-tuning. The objective and subjective results indicate that SongGLM can generate melodies from lyrics with significant improvements in both alignment and harmony, outperforming all the previous baseline methods.",

In the r-SADP etching process, due to the distinct etching environments at the center and corner of the array, there are differences in the etched trench critical dimension at the center and corner, which will adversely affect the performance and yield of the device. This paper investigates the impact of pressure, source power, and gas during the carbon etch-back (C-EB) step in the r-SADP process on the loading effect observed at both the center and corner of the array. The results indicate that applying high pressure during the C-EB over etching step can effectively alleviate the loading effect at the center and corner of the array in the r-SADP process.",

However, there is a lack of literature that comprehensively combs through the work in this field. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques, focusing on three key components: conditioning input construction, conditioning mechanism, and music generation frameworks. We categorize existing approaches based on their designs for each component, clarifying the roles of different strategies. Preceding this, we provide a fine-grained categorization of video and music modalities, illustrating how different categories influence the design of components within the generation pipelines. Furthermore, we summarize available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.",

      "abstract": "Text image inpainting is critically important across a wide range of applications, from archival recovery to image editing. This task presents significant challenges, as it requires preserving text legibility while maintaining overall image integrity. In this paper, we tackle the problem of inpainting corrupted text images by proposing a novel framework that utilizes multi-task learning within a diffusion model. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, which first restore the global text structure and then the image content, our method simultaneously repairs both the text structure and the image content, enabling effective information sharing between the two tasks. This results in a more robust and generalized model capable of handling diverse corruption scenarios more effectively. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods, demonstrating notable improvements in both image quality and accuracy in downstream tasks.",

      "abstract": "Design fixation refers to the phenomenon where designers adhere to a limited set of ideas during the design process, thereby hindering innovation. Utilizing various types of stimulus materials is considered a significant method to alleviate design fixation. With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technologies, designers can efficiently access a variety of inspirational stimulus materials. However, research on how to best combine multiple types of stimulus materials to mitigate design fixation is sparse. This study combined two types of stimulus materials—text and virtual models—and experimentally explored the impact of stimulus timing (synchronous, virtual model before text, and text before virtual model) and combination forms (matching and mixed) on design fixation. The results indicate that presenting the physical model before the text in a mixed sequential manner effectively alleviates design fixation.",

      "abstract": "Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to monitor system status, such as fault detection in industrial systems. However, detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is challenging due to few labels, complex spatiotemporal correlations, and ultrafast detecting demands. Existing anomaly detection methods rarely address these challenges simultaneously. Herein, we design an adversarial transformers-based unsupervised anomaly detection model (ATUAD). In ATUAD, a Transformer-based encoder–decoder is constructed to learn sequence features, and adversarial training is adopted to amplify mild anomalies and enhance the robustness. Besides, we propose a peak-over-threshold-based dynamic threshold mechanism to improve the anomaly detection performance of ATUAD by automatically determining the threshold. In addition, we provide an anomaly explanation method to help ATUAD pinpoint root causes for anomalies. Comparison experiments, ablation studies, and overhead analysis on public datasets show that ATUAD can outperform the state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "P2-type Na<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ni<sub><i>y</i></sub>Mn<sub>1-<i>y</i></sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathodes have attracted attention due to their excellent stability and low cost, making them promising for sodium-ion batteries. However, their practical application is limited by a low capacity at lower voltages and severe phase transitions at higher voltage. To address these challenges, we report a material Na<sub>0.6</sub>Ni<sub>0.3</sub>Mn<sub>0.7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-OVs (NNMO-OVs) with significantly slowed phase transitions at high voltage by introducing oxygen vacancies OVs into the P2/P3 mixed phase cathode Na<sub>0.6</sub>Ni<sub>0.3</sub>Mn<sub>0.7</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NNMO). Such a modification effectively broadens the Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion pathways and enhances anionic redox reactions (ARR). As a result, an improved capacity of 173 mAh·g<sup>-1</sup> at 1C is obtained by the desirable cathode within a voltage range of 1.5-4.3 V. Even at 10C, it exhibits a capacity of 60.1 mAh·g<sup>-1</sup> between 2 and 4.1 V, maintaining 70.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles, showcasing impressive rate performance and cycling stability. Additionally, the P2/P3 mixed phase exhibits the presence of an OP4 intermediate phase during charging to high voltages, while the introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) further suppresses the P-O phase transition, maintaining only the P2-OP4 phase transition process.",

      "abstract": "Music as an emotional intervention media has important applications in scenarios such as music therapy, games, and movies. However, music needs real-time arrangement according to changing emotions, bringing challenges to balance emotion real-time fit and soft emotion transition due to the fine-grained and mutable nature of the target emotion. Existing studies mainly focus on achieving emotion real-time fit, while the issue of smooth transition remains understudied, affecting the overall emotional coherence of the music. In this paper, we propose REMAST to address this trade-off. Specifically, we recognize the last timestep's music emotion and fuse it with the current timestep's input emotion. The fused emotion then guides REMAST to generate the music based on the input melody. To adjust music similarity and emotion real-time fit flexibly, we downsample the original melody and feed it into the generation model. Furthermore, we design four music theory features by domain knowledge to enhance emotion information and employ semi-supervised learning to mitigate the subjective bias introduced by manual dataset annotation. According to the evaluation results, REMAST surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in objective and subjective metrics. These results demonstrate that REMAST achieves real-time fit and smooth transition simultaneously, enhancing the coherence of the generated music.",

To help them engage more easily, it's crucial to adopt teaching strategies that lower these barriers. Informed by formative investigation and inspired by LEGO, we introduce ArchiTone, a gamified system that employs constructivism by visualizing music theory concepts as musical blocks and buildings for music education. This system includes two modes: Learning Mode, which involves recognizing and learning common musical blocks through familiar musical works; Creation Mode, which allows learners to freely create and combine musical blocks to produce new musical works. User studies demonstrate that our gamified system is not only more engaging than traditional music education methods but also more effective in helping learners understand abstract music theory and apply it to music praxis. Additionally, learners demonstrate superior performance on music theory tasks after using ArchiTone.",

This paper introduces SoundScape, a human-AI co-creation system that allows users to easily create sound memories on mobile devices through innovative interaction. By integrating sound effects and music with visual scenes, SoundScape encourages users to enrich their creations with immersive sound elements, enhancing the atmosphere of their works. To support public creation, SoundScape incorporates a conversational agent and AI music generation technology. User studies indicate that our approach is effective for sound memory creation, with SoundScape outperforming existing tools in terms of user experience and the perceived quality of produced works.",

      "abstract": "Since the reform and opening up, with the rapid development of the Chinese economy, public health problems have become increasingly serious. At the same time, due to the reality of imbalanced urban-rural development in China, improving the living environment in rural areas is the key and difficult point to achieve rural revitalization. Therefore, in 2015, the Chinese government officially began the \"Toilet Revolution\", a national public health movement aimed at improving urban and rural public health problems, enhancing people's quality of life, promoting rural economic development, and further promoting the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy. Based on a health perspective, this article analyzes the impact of the \"toilet revolution\" on rural health human capital by reviewing existing data and literature such as the \"China Statistical Yearbook\" on the level of health service expenditure and the number of sanitary toilet constructions. It further elucidates the mechanism by which the \"toilet revolution\" empowers rural revitalization, providing a theoretical basis for the government to deepen the \"toilet revolution\", narrow the urban-rural gap, and promote rural revitalization.",

We define multi-scene as variations in environmental contexts, such as transitions in game settings or movie scenes. To tackle the challenge of converting backend data into music description texts for audio generation models, MetaBGM employs a novel two-stage generation approach that transforms continuous scene and user state data into these texts, which are then fed into an audio generation model for real-time soundtrack creation. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaBGM effectively generates contextually relevant and dynamic background music for interactive applications.",

      "abstract": "Biometric recognition is extensive for user security authentication in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the potential leakage of biometric data has severe repercussions, such as identity theft or tracking. Existing authentication schemes primarily focus on protecting biometric templates but often overlook the “one-authentication multiple-access” mode. As a result, these schemes still confront challenges related to privacy leakage and low efficiency for users who frequently access the server. In this regard, this paper proposes an efficient authentication scheme syncretizing physical unclonable function (PUF) and revocable biometrics in IIoT. Specifically, we design a revocable biometric template generation method syncretizing the user’s biometric data and the device’s PUF to enhance the security and revocability of the dual identity information. Given the generated revocable biometric template and the secret sharing, our scheme implements secure authentication and key negotiation between users and servers. Additionally, we establish an access boundary and an authentication validity period to permit multiple accesses following one authentication, thus significantly decreasing the computational cost of the user-side device. We leverage BAN logic and the ROR model to prove our scheme’s security. Informal security analysis and performance comparison demonstrate that our scheme satisfies more security features with higher authentication efficiency.",

With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, it has garnered increasing attention within the design community. Previous research has primarily focused on the impact of this technology on the overall design process, with few studies exploring how generative AI influences designers’ moments of inspiration. This paper investigates the specific effects of generative AI technology on designers’ moments of inspiration through experimental research. The results indicate that generative AI technology enhances the moments of inspiration for novice designers.",

However, existing relevant schemes still have significant room for improvement in accuracy and speed. Therefore, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving image–text retrieval scheme called PITR. To enhance model performance with minimal parameter training, we freeze all parameters of a multimodal pre-trained model and incorporate trainable modules along with either a general adapter or a specialized adapter, which are used to enhance the model’s ability to perform zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval in general or specialized datasets, respectively. To preserve the privacy of outsourced data on the cloud and the privacy of the user’s retrieval process, we employ asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption technology suitable for inner product calculation, and we employ distributed index storage technology and construct a two-level security model. We construct a hierarchical index structure to speed up query matching among massive high-dimensional index vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can provide users with secure, accurate, fast cross-modal retrieval service while preserving data privacy.",

However, there is a notable scarcity of multimodal music datasets that offer aligned modal information and comprehensive annotations for music understanding and generation. In this paper, we introduce Popular Hooks: a publicly accessible multimodal music dataset comprising 38,694 popular musical hooks (i.e., memorable sections of songs) with synchronized MIDI, music video, audio, and lyrics. Furthermore, the dataset provides detailed annotations of high-level musical attributes such as tonality, structure, genre, emotion, and region. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained multimodal music emotion recognition framework for automatic emotion labeling and conduct a user study to assess its accuracy. Finally, we explore emotion-conditioned music generation baselines using this dataset, demonstrating its potential to advance the field.",

However, the high degree of abstraction and variability of cursive writing brings challenges to text identification and style research. At present, there is no large-scale database specifically for cursive handwriting recognition, which limits the research and application of calligraphy art in the digital era. This research aims to build the first database focusing on character recognition and style analysis of cursive script, aiming to promote the digitalization process of cursive script art and provide a solid foundation for future calligraphy research and application.",

      "abstract": "Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice to another singer's from a reference audio while keeping the original semantics. However, existing SVC methods can hardly perform zero-shot due to incomplete feature disentanglement or dependence on the speaker look-up table. We propose the first open-source high-quality zero-shot SVC model SaMoye that can convert singing to human and non-human timbre. SaMoye disentangles the singing voice's features into content, timbre, and pitch features, where we combine multiple ASR models and compress the content features to reduce timbre leaks. Besides, we enhance the timbre features by unfreezing the speaker encoder and mixing the speaker embedding with top-3 similar speakers. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance, which comprises more than 1,815 hours of pure singing voice and 6,367 speakers. We conduct objective and subjective experiments to find that SaMoye outperforms other models in zero-shot SVC tasks even under extreme conditions like converting singing to animals' timbre. The code and weight of SaMoye are available on https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC. The weights, code, dataset, and documents of SaMoye are publicly available on \\url{https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC}.",

      "abstract": "Amid the rising intersection of generative AI and human artistic processes, this study probes the critical yet less-explored terrain of alignment in human-centric automatic song composition. We propose a novel task of Colloquial Description-to-Song Generation, which focuses on aligning the generated content with colloquial human expressions. This task is aimed at bridging the gap between colloquial language understanding and auditory expression within an AI model, with the ultimate goal of creating songs that accurately satisfy human auditory expectations and structurally align with musical norms. Current datasets are limited due to their narrow descriptive scope, semantic gaps and inaccuracies. To overcome data scarcity in this domain, we present the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD). CaiMD is manually annotated by both professional musicians and amateurs, offering diverse perspectives and a comprehensive understanding of colloquial descriptions. Unlike existing datasets pre-set with expert annotations or auto-generated ones with inherent biases, CaiMD caters more sufficiently to our purpose of aligning AI-generated music with widespread user-desired results. Moreover, we propose an innovative single-stage framework called MuDiT/MuSiT for enabling effective human-machine alignment in song creation. This framework not only achieves cross-modal comprehension between colloquial language and auditory music perceptions but also ensures generated songs align with user-desired results. MuDiT/MuSiT employs one DiT/SiT model for end-to-end generation of musical components like melody, harmony, rhythm, vocals, and instrumentation. The approach ensures harmonious sonic cohesiveness amongst all generated musical components, facilitating better resonance with human auditory expectations.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, many video visual relation detection models rely on object tracking. However, detecting a target’s long trajectory in a raw video is still an open research issue, as tracklet-based methods suffer from poor performance in detecting the long-term relationship in the video. In order to solve this problem, we design a multi-trajectory fusion strategy that fuses the trajectory and relieves the track alignment strain. Then, to enhance encoder and decoder learning, we design a multi-branch encoder layer that separates the matching information from the appearance information of the trajectory and exploits the matching information to promote the attention maps in the decoder layer. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, ImageNet-VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate our model’s effectiveness. The developed model(TFPDT) improves VidSGG’s performance over the existing trajectory quality (about 1.64 percent mAP in Relation Detection on VidVRD and 2.7 percent mAP on VidOR).",

      "abstract": "The continuous advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enable designers to efficiently obtain vast amounts of inspirational materials during the design conception phase. Various modalities of stimuli can impact designers’ creativity. However, the relationship between the sequence of different modalities (Text, Images, and Virtual Models) and creativity remains to be explored. In this study, we investigate the effects of 6 sequential combinations of 3 modalities on designers’ creativity. Designers (N=36) used the creative stimulation platform InspireMe, accessing inspirational stimuli in various sequences to execute their design tasks. We analyzed the impact on creativity through assessments of work innovation and user interviews. The findings indicate that the sequence of material combinations significantly influences designers’ creativity, with varying impacts on the different sub-attributes of creativity. Drawing on experimental findings and qualitative research, this paper introduces a creativity demand-matching inspirational stimulation interaction strategy—the CDI strategy—that assists designers in developing more targeted design solutions. Furthermore, we propose the 3C Framework, a design strategy for creativity stimulation platforms aimed at designers in the intelligent era. This framework aims to guide the development of creative stimulation platforms for designers in the intelligent era.",

      "abstract": "While there have been studies on the relationship between higher education institutions and regional economic growth, few have delved into the economic impact of decentralized higher education institutions at the county level and associated reginal disparities in terms of socio-economic development. Utilizing the data of the Chinese universities that started to establish their campuses in counties since the year 1999, this study investigates the influence of rural university campuses on county-level GDP and industrial composition spanning from 2001 to 2020. It also delves into the temporal dynamics and regional discrepancies associated with this impact. The findings of this study show that (a) rural university campuses wield a notable positive influence on the GDP of their respective counties, particularly shaping the structure and ratio of secondary and tertiary industries; (b) the magnitude of this effect is contingent upon the duration of campus establishment and growth, intensifying over time; (c) variations in this impact are evident across the eastern, central, and western regions of China, where there are vast socio-economic differences. This study underscores the significant spillover effect of higher education decentralization on county-level economies and advocates for the pivotal role of rural university campuses in propelling county-level economic progress. Additionally, it proposes coordinated policy support from national, regional, and rural university campus authorities; the establishment of requisite support structures; and the comprehensive consideration of regional nuances.",

      "abstract": "The rapidly evolving multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) urgently require new benchmarks to uniformly evaluate their performance on understanding and textually describing music. However, due to semantic gaps between Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms and human understanding, discrepancies between professionals and the public, and low precision of annotations, existing music description datasets cannot serve as benchmarks. To this end, we present MuChin, the first open-source music description benchmark in Chinese colloquial language, designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal LLMs in understanding and describing music. We established the Caichong Music Annotation Platform (CaiMAP) that employs an innovative multi-person, multi-stage assurance method, and recruited both amateurs and professionals to ensure the precision of annotations and alignment with popular semantics. Utilizing this method, we built a dataset with multi-dimensional, high-precision music annotations, the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD), and carefully selected 1,000 high-quality entries to serve as the test set for MuChin. Based on MuChin, we analyzed the discrepancies between professionals and amateurs in terms of music description, and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of annotated data for fine-tuning LLMs. Ultimately, we employed MuChin to evaluate existing music understanding models on their ability to provide colloquial descriptions of music. All data related to the benchmark, along with the scoring code and detailed appendices, have been open-sourced (https://github.com/CarlWangChina/MuChin/).",

      "abstract": "Intent learning, which aims to learn users' intents for user understanding and item recommendation, has become a hot research spot in recent years. However, existing methods suffer from complex and cumbersome alternating optimization, limiting performance and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel intent learning method termed \\underline{ELCRec}, by unifying behavior representation learning into an \\underline{E}nd-to-end \\underline{L}earnable \\underline{C}lustering framework, for effective and efficient \\underline{Rec}ommendation. Concretely, we encode user behavior sequences and initialize the cluster centers (latent intents) as learnable neurons. Then, we design a novel learnable clustering module to separate different cluster centers, thus decoupling users' complex intents. Meanwhile, it guides the network to learn intents from behaviors by forcing behavior embeddings close to cluster centers. This allows simultaneous optimization of recommendation and clustering via mini-batch data. Moreover, we propose intent-assisted contrastive learning by using cluster centers as self-supervision signals, further enhancing mutual promotion. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of ELCRec from six perspectives. Compared to the runner-up, ELCRec improves NDCG@5 by 8.9\\% and reduces computational costs by 22.5\\% on the Beauty dataset. Furthermore, due to the scalability and universal applicability, we deploy this method on the industrial recommendation system with 130 million page views and achieve promising results. The codes are available on GitHub (https://github.com/yueliu1999/ELCRec). A collection (papers, codes, datasets) of deep group recommendation/intent learning methods is available on GitHub (https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Group-Recommendation).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The nematode species Meloidogyne incognita has been responsible for significant financial losses within the agricultural sector. Nematophagous bacteria, characterised by their extensive distribution and broad spectrum of hosts, exhibit remarkable efficacy as natural antagonists against nematodes. Sneb518 ( Clostridium beijerinckii ) fermentation broth displayed substantial biocontrol activity against M. incognita in previous research. Optimizing fermentation conditions is a fundamental technique for dramatically enhancing end product performance. There has been no such study conducted yet on enhancing the nematicidal activities of Sneb518 ( Clostridium beijerinckii ) fermentation using response surface methodology (RSM). Methods: The influence of strain Sneb518 fermentation media and conditions on nematicidal activity was examined using the three-factor technique and a Plackett-Burman design, and the interaction between various fermentation factors was examined using a Box-Behnken design. The present study employed response surface methodology (RSM) to examine and enhance the nematicidal activity of Sneb518 culture filtrates by identifying and optimising the influential components. Results: Glucose, peanut cake flour, and potassium chloride as carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic salts displayed considerably increased nematicidal potential in the present study. Furthermore, the corrected mortality of J2 ranged from 52.24% to 91.15% when utilizing the Box-Behnken design. These findings clearly support the application of RSM for medium optimization. Moreover, the outcomes of the validation experiment corresponded to the model predictions. Discussion: This research has enhanced the biocontrol ability of C. beijerinckii to control M. incognita and this research has led to the advancement of new biocontrol agents.",

      "abstract": "Some of the Chinese subway signaling systems have been in use for more than 20 years, approaching the safe service life of the Urban Rail Transit Signal system, and the existing signal system cannot meet the requirements of tighter, safer and more comfortable train operation due to the growing development of the city and society, therefore, the existing signal system needs to be upgraded. Urban rail transit, as the main infrastructure of a city, carries extremely important functions and needs to avoid delays and interruptions in operation, and the signal system, as the central system for commanding the safe operation of trains in urban rail transit, cannot have any faults that affect normal operation during the transformation process. Based on this, this paper is a case study of signalling system transformation of Dalian Metro Line 3, with a view to providing reference for relevant signal system transformation. [1].",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained language models have achieved impressive results in various music understanding and generation tasks. However, existing pre-training methods for symbolic melody generation struggle to capture multi-scale, multi-dimensional structural information in note sequences, due to the domain knowledge discrepancy between text and music. Moreover, the lack of available large-scale symbolic melody datasets limits the pre-training improvement. In this paper, we propose MelodyGLM, a multi-task pre-training framework for generating melodies with long-term structure. We design the melodic n-gram and long span sampling strategies to create local and global blank infilling tasks for modeling the local and global structures in melodies. Specifically, we incorporate pitch n-grams, rhythm n-grams, and their combined n-grams into the melodic n-gram blank infilling tasks for modeling the multi-dimensional structures in melodies. To this end, we have constructed a large-scale symbolic melody dataset, MelodyNet, containing more than 0.4 million melody pieces. MelodyNet is utilized for large-scale pre-training and domain-specific n-gram lexicon construction. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that MelodyGLM surpasses the standard and previous pre-training methods. In particular, subjective evaluations show that, on the melody continuation task, MelodyGLM gains average improvements of 0.82, 0.87, 0.78, and 0.94 in consistency, rhythmicity, structure, and overall quality, respectively. Notably, MelodyGLM nearly matches the quality of human-composed melodies on the melody inpainting task.",

      "abstract": "Multi-layer satellite network (MLSN) is an important part of the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN), it has obvious advantages in coverage density, business processing, service efficiency and other comprehensive capabilities compared with ordinary single-layer satellite networks. However, due to the fact that many space nodes, highly dynamic topology changes and wireless links scattered in free space, MLSNs are facing the dual challenges of inefficient organization and lack of security. In this case, this paper considers providing secure encryption decision support for the return of data obtained by low earth orbit (LEO) observation satellites relying on the local autonomous region of multi-layer satellite space. By quantifying the security strength of encryption algorithms, the work to be optimized is described as the problem of maximizing the security strength under the constraint of return delay of the data. This paper thus proposes a solution based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which relies on reasonably setting the key supporting elements such as state, action and reward closely related to the problem to achieve fast and reliable decision output, and the simulation results show that the proposed method has better performance than many comparison methods.",

      "abstract": "While deep generative models have empowered music generation, it remains a challenging and under-explored problem to edit an existing musical piece at fine granularity. In this paper, we propose SDMuse, a unified Stochastic Differential Music editing and generation framework, which can not only compose a whole musical piece from scratch, but also modify existing musical pieces in many ways, such as combination, continuation, inpainting, and style transferring. The proposed SDMuse follows a two-stage pipeline to achieve music generation and editing on top of a hybrid representation including pianoroll and MIDI-event. In particular, SDMuse first generates/edits pianoroll by iteratively denoising through a stochastic differential equation (SDE) based on a diffusion model generative prior, and then refines the generated pianoroll and predicts MIDI-event tokens auto-regressively. We evaluate the generated music of our method on <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ailabs1k7</i> pop music dataset in terms of quality and controllability on various music editing and generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed stochastic differential music editing and generation process, as well as the hybrid representations.",

      "abstract": "Since a sluggish conversion reaction and shuttling of polysulfides have been barriers to high-performance Li–S batteries, it is particularly critical to establish nanostructured electrocatalysts with high specific surface area and electron conductivity, an excellent anchoring capability, and long-term durability. Herein, a robust binary synergistic MoS2/MXene heterostructure is proposed by the homogeneous growth of MoS2 on an MXene substrate. Due to the hierarchical structure and strong interfacial coupling effect, the binary synergistic MoS2/MXene heterostructure not only suppresses the restacking of MoS2 and MXene nanosheets but also provides abundant active sites to capture polysulfides and catalyze its conversion reaction. Typically, polysulfides are immobilized by MoS2 nanosheets; then, the anchored polysulfides are rapidly transferred from MoS2 to MXene via heterointerfaces. The MXene surface is endowed with abundant oxygen terminations, which accelerates the polysulfide conversion kinetics to a great extent. Therefore, the assembled Li–S battery delivers a reversible capacity of 981 mA h g–1 at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. Even at high rate of 5 C, capacity is still maintained at an excellent level of 408 mA h g–1 after 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 96.5%. Even more fascinating, at 0.2 C, the MoS2/MXene cathode can realize a high sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm–2 and with capacities of 608 mA h g–1 over 500 cycles, which will promote the practical applications of Li–S batteries.",

      "abstract": "Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT), which can be regarded as automatic speech recognition (ASR) on singing voice, is an interesting and practical topic in academia and industry. ALT has not been well developed mainly due to the dearth of the paired singing voice and lyrics datasets for model training. Considering that there is a large amount of ASR training data, a straightforward method is to leverage ASR data to enhance ALT training. However, the improvement is marginal when training the ALT system directly with ASR data, because of the gap between the singing voice and standard speech data which is rooted in music-specific acoustic characteristics in singing voice. In this paper, we propose PDAugment, a data augmentation method that adjusts pitch and duration of speech at syllable level under the guidance of music scores to help ALT training. Specifically, we adjust the pitch and duration of each syllable in natural speech to those of the corresponding note extracted from music scores, to narrow the gap between natural speech and singing voice. Experiments on DSing30 and Dali corpus show that the ALT system equipped with our PDAugment outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems by 5.9% and 18.1% WERs respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of PDAugment for ALT.",

      "abstract": "Lyric-to-melody generation, which generates melody according to given lyrics, is one of the most important automatic music composition tasks. With the rapid development of deep learning, previous works address this task with end-to-end neural network models. However, deep learning models cannot well capture the strict but subtle relationships between lyrics and melodies, which compromises the harmony between lyrics and generated melodies. In this paper, we propose ReLyMe, a method that incorporates Relationships between Lyrics and Melodies from music theory to ensure the harmony between lyrics and melodies. Specifically, we first introduce several principles that lyrics and melodies should follow in terms of tone, rhythm, and structure relationships. These principles are then integrated into neural network lyric-to-melody models by adding corresponding constraints during the decoding process to improve the harmony between lyrics and melodies. We use a series of objective and subjective metrics to evaluate the generated melodies. Experiments on both English and Chinese song datasets show the effectiveness of ReLyMe, demonstrating the superiority of incorporating lyric-melody relationships from the music domain into neural lyric-to-melody generation.",

      "abstract": "Real-time music accompaniment generation has a wide range of applications in the music industry, such as music education and live performances. However, automatic real-time music accompaniment generation is still understudied and often faces a trade-off between logical latency and exposure bias. In this paper, we propose SongDriver, a real-time music accompaniment generation system without logical latency nor exposure bias. Specifically, SongDriver divides one accompaniment generation task into two phases: 1) The arrangement phase, where a Transformer model first arranges chords for input melodies in real-time, and caches the chords for the next phase instead of playing them out. 2) The prediction phase, where a CRF model generates playable multi-track accompaniments for the coming melodies based on previously cached chords. With this two-phase strategy, SongDriver directly generates the accompaniment for the upcoming melody, achieving zero logical latency. Furthermore, when predicting chords for a timestep, SongDriver refers to the cached chords from the first phase rather than its previous predictions, which avoids the exposure bias problem. Since the input length is often constrained under real-time conditions, another potential problem is the loss of long-term sequential information. To make up for this disadvantage, we extract four musical features from a long-term music piece before the current time step as global information. In the experiment, we train SongDriver on some open-source datasets and an original \\`aiSong Dataset built from Chinese-style modern pop music scores. The results show that SongDriver outperforms existing SOTA (state-of-the-art) models on both objective and subjective metrics, meanwhile significantly reducing the physical latency.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning is applied widely in the field of intrusion detection at present, the existing intrusion detection algorithm is relatively mature, but how to solve the problem of unbalanced sample data still need further research. Aiming at the problem of detection accuracy and efficiency caused by sample data imbalance in the process of intrusion detection, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on the fusion of Auxiliary Classification Adversarial Network (ACGAN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) (ACGAN-GNN). Firstly, ACGAN is used to expand minority samples in data preprocessing to optimize the dataset, and then the improved heterogeneous graph neural network algorithm is used to model the sample flow relationship in the classification process, so as to improve the detection robustness of minority attack samples and unknown attack samples. The model is evaluated by CICIDS2017 dataset. Compared with similar algorithms, ACGAN-GNN not only has better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score, but also has higher accuracy against minority or unknown attack types.",

Identifying consumer emotions, understanding the changes in shopping interests, and developing appropriate sales strategies is a challenging task for retail service robots. We investigate the feasibility of using computer vision methods for empowering robots with empathy by examining the correlation between consumer emotion and levels of shopping interest. To this end, we construct the first video database of consumer sentiment changes in a business context and propose a deep learning method that uses multimodal information to infer consumers’ shopping intentions, and conduct preliminary experimental validation on this database. The experimental results show that the proposed method is 7% and 10% more accurate than manual assessment (n = 40) in identifying consumer emotions and predicting consumer shopping interest levels, respectively. Thus, the proposed method is valid and effective. We anticipate that the results of this study will have considerable implications for human–computer interaction research in service robots.",

S3T introduces a momentum-based paradigm, MoCo, with Swin Transformer as its feature extractor to music time-frequency domain. For better music representations learning, S3T contributes a music data augmentation pipeline and two specially designed pre-processors. To our knowledge, S3T is the first method combining the Swin Transformer with a self-supervised learning method for music classification. We evaluate S3T on music genre classification and music tagging tasks with linear classifiers trained on learned representations. Experimental results show that S3T outperforms the previous self-supervised method (CLMR) by 12.5 percents top-1 accuracy and 4.8 percents PR-AUC on two tasks respectively, and also surpasses the task-specific state-of-the-art supervised methods. Besides, S3T shows advances in label efficiency using only 10% labeled data exceeding CLMR on both tasks with 100% labeled data.",

      "abstract": "We digitally reproduce the process of resource collaboration, design creation, and visual presentation of Chinese seal-carving art. We develop an intelligent seal-carving art-generation system (Zhejiang University Intelligent Seal-Carving System, http://www.next.zju.edu.cn/seal/ ; the website of the seal-carving search and layout system is http://www.next.zju.edu.cn/seal/search_app/ ) to deal with the difficulty in using a visual knowledge guided computational art approach. The knowledge base in this study is the Qiushi Seal-Carving Database, which consists of open datasets of images of seal characters and seal stamps. We propose a seal character generation method based on visual knowledge, guided by the database and expertise. Furthermore, to create the layout of the seal, we propose a deformation algorithm to adjust the seal characters and calculate layout parameters from the database and knowledge to achieve an intelligent structure. Experimental results show that this method and system can effectively deal with the difficulties in the generation of seal carving. Our work provides theoretical and applied references for the rebirth and innovation of seal-carving art.",

      "abstract": "Considerable attention has been paid to physiological signal-based emotion recognition in the field of affective computing. For reliability and user-friendly acquisition, electrodermal activity (EDA) has a great advantage in practical applications. However, EDA-based emotion recognition with large-scale subjects is still a tough problem. The traditional well-designed classifiers with hand-crafted features produce poorer results because of their limited representation abilities. And the deep learning models with auto feature extraction suffer the overfitting drop-off because of large-scale individual differences. Since music has a strong correlation with human emotion, static music can be involved as the external benchmark to constrain various dynamic EDA signals. In this article, we make an attempt by fusing the subject’s individual EDA features and the external evoked music features. And we propose an end-to-end multimodal framework, the one-dimensional residual temporal and channel attention network (RTCAN-1D). For EDA features, the channel-temporal attention mechanism for EDA-based emotion recognition is first involved in mine the temporal and channel-wise dynamic and steady features. The comparisons with single EDA-based SOTA models on DEAP and AMIGOS datasets prove the effectiveness of RTCAN-1D to mine EDA features. For music features, we simply process the music signal with the open-source toolkit openSMILE to obtain external feature vectors. We conducted systematic and extensive evaluations. The experiments on the current largest music emotion dataset PMEmo validate that the fusion of EDA and music is a reliable and efficient solution for large-scale emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Music–visual retrieval is of broad interest in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Most research relies on emotional tags or is based on content but does not consider stylistic and cultural differences between music and videos. As a result, only one‐sided dimensions are considered for automatic music retrieval for videos, while the stylistic correlation between audio‐visual is ignored. At the same time, the needs of different cultural regions cannot be well met. Therefore, the first labelled extensive Music Video (MV) dataset, Next‐MV, is constructed in this paper consisting of 6000 pieces of 30‐s MV fragments, including five music style labels and four cultural labels. The proposed Next‐Net framework is built to study the correlation between music style and visual style. The optimal audiovisual feature set and model structure are obtained in the experiments. The accuracy reached 71.1%, higher than the baseline model (66.9%). Furthermore, in the cross‐cultural experiment, it is found that the accuracy of the general fusion model (71.1%) is between the model trained by within‐dataset (76%) and the model trained by cross‐dataset (60%), indicating that culture has a significant influence on the correlation between music and visual. The experiments of pair classification on cultures are further carried out. It is found that Rock and Dance are more culturally influenced than R&amp;B and Hip‐hop. Among all the cultures discussed, Chinese and Japanese music and videos show great differences among most of the styles, while Korean music videos styles are more similar to western styles than other eastern cultures.",

We propose three criteria for effective AST—preserving meaning, singability and intelligibility—and design metrics for these criteria. We develop a new benchmark for English–Mandarin song translation and develop an unsupervised AST system, Guided AliGnment for Automatic Song Translation (GagaST), which combines pre-training with three decoding constraints. Both automatic and human evaluations show GagaST successfully balances semantics and singability.",

This paper aims to refine the results of static analysis tools, by automatically searching for a vulnerable path from given defect report. To realize this goal, we develop SATRACER, a novel tool which integrates symbolic execution techniques with static analysis. SATRACER selectively skips those program parts which can be consistently updated by static analysis, thus drastically improving performance. We have applied SATRACER to a set of 21 real-world applications. Evaluation results show that SATRACER can successfully remove 71.4% false alarms reported by a commercial static analysis tool in 10 hours, and confirmed 29 real use-after-free bugs and 895 real null-pointer-dereference bugs.",

      "abstract": "Traditional Chinese music is a great treasure for China and the rest of the world, which is accompanied by variant traditional musical instruments and featured with distinct melodies within different dynasties. Developing an efficient music retrieval system for traditional Chinese music requires numerous such music data with rich and accurate annotations. However, existing databases usually consider popular and contemporary music, basic taxonomy, and a single task. In this work, we introduce the JinYue database of more than 1000 pieces of music played by variants of huqin (huqin music) spanning the age range of the 20th century to date. The database includes over 10,000 annotations of huqin music in terms of discrete emotion, scene, and imagery labels. We provide extensive benchmarks of multi-class classification results for emotion, scene, and imagery along with the database. Furthermore, due to the copyright, we develop a JinYue Music Exploring System to provide the information of over 1,000 pieces of music played by huqin, including huqin music metadata, audio features, and annotations. We will continuously collect more music by Chinese musical instruments categories to enrich the JinYue database. This database aims to push forward the research in affective computing, music information retrieval, and beyond.",

To develop the next-generation intelligent interactive systems, we require numerous human facial expressions with accurate annotations. However, existing databases usually consider nonspontaneous human behavior (posed or induced), individual or dyadic setting, and a single type of emotion annotation. To address this need, we created the Werewolf-XL database, which contains a total of 890 minutes of spontaneous audio-visual recordings of 129 subjects in a group interaction of nine individuals playing a conversational role-playing game called Werewolf. We provide 131,688 individual utterance-level video clips with internal self-assessment of 18 non-prototypical emotional categories and external assessment of pleasure, arousal, and dominance, including 14,632 speakers' samples and the rest of listeners' samples. Besides, the results of the annotation agreement analysis show fair reliability and validity. Role information and outcomes of the game are also recorded. Furthermore, we provided extensive benchmarks of unimodal and multimodal emotional recognition results. The database is made publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore how gender influences peer assessment in team-building activities in China. Design/methodology/approach A nine-player Werewolf game was adopted to conduct the experiment. Nine abilities were defined to evaluate players’ performances. Before the game, players filled out a self-assessment questionnaire (five-point Likert scale). After the game, players evaluated other game members’ performances using the same questionnaire. Data were analyzed using linear regression. Findings The results showed that gender bias clearly existed in team-building activities, with men more likely to receive better peer assessment than women. In addition, when women presented themselves as actively as men did, they received less favorable evaluations than men, whereas their failures were more likely to be exaggerated. Practical implications This study may help build harmonious teams for gender equality, and we give practical suggestions respectively from the perspective of female employees, their managers, and their companies. Originality/value Given the importance of team-building activities in teamwork, fair evaluations of team-building performances are essential. However, gender influences on peer assessment in team-building activities in China remain unclear. This study adds new and important knowledge to research on gender bias in teams.",

      "abstract": "Existing speech to speech translation systems heavily rely on the text of target language: they usually translate source language either to target text and then synthesize target speech from text, or directly to target speech with target text for auxiliary training. However, those methods cannot be applied to unwritten target languages, which have no written text or phoneme available. In this paper, we develop a translation system for unwritten languages, named as UWSpeech, which converts target unwritten speech into discrete tokens with a converter, and then translates source-language speech into target discrete tokens with a translator, and finally synthesizes target speech from target discrete tokens with an inverter. We propose a method called XL-VAE, which enhances vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with cross-lingual (XL) speech recognition, to train the converter and inverter of UWSpeech jointly. Experiments on Fisher Spanish-English conversation translation dataset show that UWSpeech outperforms direct translation and VQ-VAE baseline by about 16 and 10 BLEU points respectively, which demonstrate the advantages and potentials of UWSpeech.",

      "abstract": "While neural-based text to speech (TTS) models can synthesize natural and intelligible voice, they usually require high-quality speech data, which is costly to collect. In many scenarios, only noisy speech of a target speaker is available, which presents challenges for TTS model training for this speaker. Previous works usually address the challenge using two methods: 1) training the TTS model using the speech denoised with an enhancement model; 2) taking a single noise embedding as input when training with noisy speech. However, they usually cannot handle speech with real-world complicated noise such as those with high variations along time. In this paper, we develop DenoiSpeech, a TTS system that can synthesize clean speech for a speaker with noisy speech data. In DenoiSpeech, we handle real-world noisy speech by modeling the fine-grained frame-level noise with a noise condition module, which is jointly trained with the TTS model. Experimental results on real-world data show that DenoiSpeech outperforms the previous two methods by 0.31 and 0.66 MOS respectively. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>",

      "abstract": "The emotional use of music plays an important role in influencing people's music-searching behaviour. Many users listen to music for multiple mood regulation purposes. Therefore, emotional preference should be taken into consideration especially when building context-aware music recommendation systems which aim to satisfy users' short-term music needs. In addition, cultural differences will affect the way people experience and value emotion from music. Based on these aspects, we investigate the emotional preference of music in daily activities through a cross-cultural survey in China and the UK, and build emotional maps between activity and music for the two countries. Furthermore, we introduce EmoMusic, a novel emotion-based music recommendation service for daily activities which supports visualisation and control of music emotion through an interactive interface. A user study is presented to evaluate the application. Results reveal good usability of the service and show that visualization and interaction in a music emotion space can improve acceptance of music recommendations. Our work helps to understand the emotional preference of music for various activities and how to exploit emotional cues of music in a music recommendation service, paving the way for more user-centered music recommendation systems.",

      "abstract": "Considerable attention has been paid for physiological signal-based emotion recognition in field of affective computing. For the reliability and user friendly acquisition, Electrodermal Activity (EDA) has great advantage in practical applications. However, the EDA-based emotion recognition with hundreds of subjects still lacks effective solution. In this paper, our work makes an attempt to fuse the subject individual EDA features and the external evoked music features. And we propose an end-to-end multimodal framework, the 1-dimensional residual temporal and channel attention network (RTCAN-1D). For EDA features, the novel convex optimization-based EDA (CvxEDA) method is applied to decompose EDA signals into pahsic and tonic signals for mining the dynamic and steady features. The channel-temporal attention mechanism for EDA-based emotion recognition is firstly involved to improve the temporal- and channel-wise representation. For music features, we process the music signal with the open source toolkit openSMILE to obtain external feature vectors. The individual emotion features from EDA signals and external emotion benchmarks from music are fused in the classifing layers. We have conducted systematic comparisons on three multimodal datasets (PMEmo, DEAP, AMIGOS) for 2-classes valance/arousal emotion recognition. Our proposed RTCAN-1D outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models, which also validate that our work provides an reliable and efficient solution for large scale emotion recognition. Our code has been released at https://github.com/guanghaoyin/RTCAN-1D.",

Aiming to solve the problem of difficulty in extracting EEG signal features and building large computational models, an innovative method is proposed for obtaining reliable distinctive features from EEG signals. The feature extraction method combines differential entropy with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and can be applied to feature extraction of emotional EEG signals. Three types of emotional EEG data sets are used to conduct experiments. Experimental results show that the feature extraction method can effectively improve the performance of the EEG classification: the average accuracy is improved by 68% compared to the results of the original data set, which is 7% higher than the result obtained by feature extraction using only differential entropy. The total execution time indicates that the proposed method has a lower time complexity. The research results have important practical significance in the field of three-category EEG emotion recognition and can be effectively applied to the actual engineering field.",

      "abstract": "Music can trigger human emotion. This is a psychophysiological process. Therefore, using psychophysiological characteristics could be a way to understand individual music emotional experience. In this study, we explore a new method of personal music emotion recognition based on human physiological characteristics. First, we build up a database of features based on emotions related to music and a database based on physiological signals derived from music listening including EDA, PPG, SKT, RSP, and PD variation information. Then linear regression, ridge regression, support vector machines with three different kernels, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, multi-layer perceptron, and Nu support vector regression (NuSVR) are used to recognize music emotions via a data synthesis of music features and human physiological features. NuSVR outperforms the other methods. The correlation coefficient values are 0.7347 for arousal and 0.7902 for valence, while the mean squared errors are 0.023 23 for arousal and 0.014 85 for valence. Finally, we compare the different data sets and find that the data set with all the features (music features and all physiological features) has the best performance in modeling. The correlation coefficient values are 0.6499 for arousal and 0.7735 for valence, while the mean squared errors are 0.029 32 for arousal and 0.015 76 for valence. We provide an effective way to recognize personal music emotional experience, and the study can be applied to personalized music recommendation.",

The measure of computing concept similarity is a fundament of semantic computation. In this paper, we analyze typical semantic similarity measures and note Wu and Palmer’s measure which does not distinguish the similarities between nodes from a node to different nodes of the same level. Then, we synthesize the advantages of measure of path-based and IC-based, and propose a new hybrid method for measuring semantic similarity. By testing on a fragment of WordNet hierarchical tree, the results demonstrate the proposed method accurately distinguishes the similarities between nodes from a node to different nodes of the same level and overcome the shortcoming of the Wu and Palmer’s measure",

A new method was proposed to obtain the digitized data from literatures, followed by data processing, storage and services. Moreover, a repository was set up to support an online aerosol-literature-knowledge-service module which provides special services including \"keyword query, thesis topic classification, duplicate check, paper evaluation and data visualization\". Furthermore, crowdsourcing, a distributed problem solving mechanism was proposed that the users can submit formatted data to update and expand the repository. At the same time, the web page of crowdsourcing submission also optimizes the user interaction such as adding thesaurus and drop-down options to ensure the users' experience. The SARS is expected to provide a convenient platform for sharing aerosol data and maximize the data usage in the atmospheric aerosol research community.",

In this study, 204 effective samples were collected from a well-known domestic human resource service institution, and the contingency relationship and mechanism between psychological contract and employee work investment were discussed. The results show that the transactional psychological contract and relational contract have 1significant positive effects on the employee's job engagement. The transactional and relational contracts have significant positive effects on organizational affective commitment. Organizational affective commitment has significant positive effect on employee's job involvement. Organizational affective commitment plays an intermediary role in the relationship between psychological contract and job involvement.",

      "abstract": "External stimulation, mood swing, and physiological arousal are closely related and induced by each other. The exploration of internal relations between these three aspects is interesting and significant. Currently, video is the most popular multimedia stimuli that can express rich emotional semantics by its visual and auditory features. Apart from the video features, human electroencephalography (EEG) features can provide useful information for video emotion recognition, as they are the direct and instant authentic feedback on human perception with individuality. In this paper, we collected a total of 39 participants' EEG data induced by watching emotional video clips and built a fusion dataset of EEG and video features. Subsequently, the machine-learning algorithms, including Liblinear, REPTree, XGBoost, MultilayerPerceptron, RandomTree, and RBFNetwork were applied to obtain the optimal model for video emotion recognition based on a multi-modal dataset. We discovered that using the data fusion of all-band EEG power spectrum density features and video audio-visual features can achieve the best recognition results. The video emotion classification accuracy achieves 96.79% for valence (Positive/Negative) and 97.79% for arousal (High/Low). The study shows that this method can be a potential method of video emotion indexing for video information retrieval.",

      "abstract": "Fake or tampered images pose a real problem in today's life. It is easy to unknowingly be drawn to an interesting image that is false. Recently, with the emergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs), it becomes much more easy to generate high-quality fake images in a very realistic way. However, the current digital image forensics algorithms mainly focus on the detection of traditional tampered images or need prior knowledge of the network structure of GANs. Hence, verifying the authenticity of an image is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a general method for simultaneously detecting tampered images, and GANs generated images. First, we use the Scharr operator to extract the edge information of the image. Then, we converted the edge image information matrix into the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to scale the image without loss of image information. Finally, GLCM was fed into the deep neural network designed based on depthwise separable convolution for training. Compared with other methods, our model achieves a higher macro average of F1 score of 0.9865. Meanwhile, our method has better performance in detecting tampered images and has strong generalization ability for many GANs models.",

      "abstract": "Synesthesia is a phenomenon in which human experience a cross-sensory interaction in perception. However, it is hard to bridge two sensory modalities in artificial intelligence. Emotion, the universal content across multiple media modalities, can be a cue to connect sensory perceptions for developing computer-based synesthetic intelligence. In this study, we present an image-music, cross-synesthesia-aware model based on their similarity in the emotion space. In this experiment, we built an affective synesthesia database of 250,000 image-music pairs. Multiple music and image features were extracted to form the database. Emotional representation is abstract and complex in perception, and the recognition of emotional similarity is fraught with uncertainty. In this work, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and Euclidean distance (ED) method was compared to obtain the emotional similarity labels of each affective image-music pair. The proposed method could predict emotional similarity with mean squared error of 0.0075, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and may shed light on the development of cross-modal synesthesia-aware systems.",

      "abstract": "Most text sentiment classification methods have the shortcomings of insufficient semantic understanding and low classification accuracy. To solve these problems, a sentiment classification model based on capsule network (SC-BiCapsNet) was proposed in this paper. In the stage of word vectorization, the G-Word model is presented to improve the ability of text information representation. In the stage of text semantic representation, the COL-Att model is presented to optimize the semantic coding structure and enhance the effect of text semantic expression. In the stage of text classification, the capsule network is devised, and its core dynamic routing algorithm can increase the weight value of important features, thus improving the accuracy of classification results. This paper evaluates the performance of SC-BiCapsNet model on two text datasets, IMDB and NLPCC 2014 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the results of other related models on IMDB dataset and gets the highest accuracy of 0.9238. Meanwhile, comparing with the best system in NLPCC2014-Task II, the F1-scsore of SC-BiCapsNet has increased by at least 1.5%, which proves the validity of SC-BiCapsNet. In the future work, we will try to reduce the time consumption and improve the generalization ability of the model.",

A Music Emotion Experiment was well-designed for collecting the affective-annotated music corpus of high quality, which recruited 457 subjects.",

      "abstract": "A detailed assessment is carried out in relation to the influence of the uncertainties associated with the input auxiliary atmospheric state parameters on retrieving aerosol optical properties from high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) observations. The study starts from a review of the main spectral structure of the Rayleigh backscattering followed by evaluating the temperature effects on a backscattering cross section of atmospheric molecules based on numerical simulation. It shows that the transmittance of the background interference filter should be taken into account, depending on the full width at half maximum, although overall temperature dependence is negligible. Based on the Taylor expansion of the Tenti S6 model, the systematic errors arising from input temperature and pressure profiles are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the atmospheric pressure profiles have limited effects on the inversion results of aerosol optical parameters, as the atmospheric pressure is usually quite stable. The relative errors of the aerosol backscatter coefficient mainly stem from temperature profile errors and highly depend on the aerosol concentration. Quantitatively, the aerosol backscatter coefficient error could be larger than 5% with a 3 K deviation of temperature when the backscatter ratio is larger than 1.1. The accuracy of aerosol extinction coefficient retrieval is affected not only by the error in temperature, but also by the error in temperature lapse rate; the retrieval accuracy is more sensitive to the latter than the former. Further analysis based on the sounding temperature data shows that the variation of the temperature inversion layer during the night could induce a bias larger than 0.04 <i>km</i><sup>-1</sup> on the aerosol extinction coefficient retrieval. Therefore, the time resolution of temperature measurement from sounding balloons twice per day is too low to obtain an accurate retrieval of the aerosol optical properties from the HSRL.",

      "abstract": "Frontalization typically represents the process of generating frontal views of faces from single unconstrained images. Previous researches have suggested that face frontalization may considerably improve the performance of current face recognition systems in the wild. While many frontalization methods focuses on 3D reconstruction, approximating facial surface for each input image could be a hard problem and lead to facial misalignment. Therefore, more straightforward and simple approaches are proposed. A single unmodified 3D surface is used to approximate the shape of all input faces, and the frontal view is obtained through two specific steps, hard frontalization and soft symmetry. However, we find that large pose variations and landmark localization error may result in extreme artifacts in frontalized faces. To improve the performance of this strategy, we firstly proposed an adaptive method to take the posture of head into consideration, and use it to adjust the soft symmetry step. Then the quality of frontalization is assessed so we are able to adaptively compensate for the landmark localization error. Experiments on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark and CAS-PEAL-R1 dataset verify the effectivity of our methods to unconstrained conditions.",

      "abstract": "A half-wave plate (HWP) is a critical component for calibrating the gain ratio in polarization lidars. In this paper, the effects of a nonideal HWP on the gain ratio calibration measurements are analyzed. We focus on the ±45° method and the multi-rotation HWP method, which are the two main approaches for calibrating the gain ratio. Specifically, we discuss the influences of a nonideal HWP from two scenarios: an HWP with nonideal polarization properties and an ideal HWP under nonideal external conditions. The allowable ranges of relevant parameters for the nonideal polarization properties of HWPs are obtained, which can help to determine qualified HWPs in polarization lidars. Several external conditions, including ambient temperature variations, wavelength differences, and the tilt angles of HWPs, are also analyzed in detail. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first comprehensive study on the effects of nonideal HWPs on the gain ratio calibration measurements, offering some guidelines on choosing a qualified HWP for proper use in polarization lidars.",

      "abstract": "The extinction efficiencies of atmospheric particles are essential to determining radiation attenuation and thus are fundamentally related to atmospheric radiative transfer. The extinction efficiencies can also be used to retrieve particle sizes or refractive indices through particle characterization techniques. This study first uses the Debye series to improve the accuracy of high-frequency extinction formulae for spheroids in the context of Complex angular momentum theory by determining an optimal number of edge-effect terms. We show that the optimal edge-effect terms can be accurately obtained by comparing the results from the approximate formula with their counterparts computed from the invariant imbedding Debye series and T-matrix methods. An invariant imbedding T-matrix method is employed for particles with strong absorption, in which case the extinction efficiency is equivalent to two plus the edge-effect efficiency. For weakly absorptive or non-absorptive particles, the T-matrix results contain the interference between the diffraction and higher-order transmitted rays. Therefore, the Debye series was used to compute the edge-effect efficiency by separating the interference from the transmission on the extinction efficiency. We found that the optimal number strongly depends on the refractive index and is relatively insensitive to the particle geometry and size parameter. By building a table of optimal numbers of edge-effect terms, we developed an efficient and accurate extinction simulator that has been fully tested for randomly oriented spheroids with various aspect ratios and a wide range of refractive indices.",

This paper focuses on IC computing methods and IC measures, which estimate the semantic similarities between concepts by exploiting the topological parameters of the taxonomy. Based on analyzing representative IC computing methods and typical semantic similarity measures, we propose a new hybrid IC computing method. Through adopting the parameter dhyp and lch, we utilize the new IC computing method and propose a novel comprehensive measure of semantic similarity between concepts. An experiment based on WordNet \"is a\" taxonomy has been designed to test representative measures and our measure on benchmark dataset R&amp;G, and the results show that our measure can obviously improve the similarity accuracy. We evaluate the proposed approach by comparing the correlation coefficients between five measures and the artificial data. The results show that our proposal outperforms the previous measures.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores a fundamental problem in music emotion analysis, i.e., how to segment the music sequence into a set of basic emotive units, which are named as emotion primitives. Current works on music emotion analysis are mainly based on the fixed-length music segments, which often leads to the difficulty of accurate emotion recognition. Short music segment, such as an individual music frame, may fail to evoke emotion response. Long music segment, such as an entire song, may convey various emotions over time. Moreover, the minimum length of music segment varies depending on the types of the emotions. To address these problems, we propose a novel method dubbed supervised dynamic clustering (SDC) to automatically decompose the music sequence into meaningful segments with various lengths. First, the music sequence is represented by a set of music frames. Then, the music frames are clustered according to the valence-arousal values in the emotion space. The clustering results are used to initialize the music segmentation. After that, a dynamic programming scheme is employed to jointly optimize the subsequent segmentation and grouping in the music feature space. Experimental results on standard dataset show both the effectiveness and the rationality of the proposed method.",

To ensure the system security and data privacy, retrieval process completely is all under the cipher-text environment. System security analysis showed that can effectively resist cipher-text-only attack and choose plain-text attack. The test performance results show that it not only has high safety, but also has a good retrieval efficiency.",

However, the body building or fitness are always ignored in modern daily life. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Personal Trainer to provide real time visually action guide and action assessment during the fitness time of users via the Microsoft Kinect Sensor. The user actions are captured by Kinect and compared to standard actions so as to give a fitness score representing how well users perform actions in real time. Users can see the skeletons of his/her own action and standard action in the screen together with videos. An action correctness guide will be displayed to guide the user to correct his/her actions. Users correct his/her actions to match the standard action in our pre-collected fitness action library. Thus our system can provide interpretable feedback on how people can improve their action. The whole system gives a new definition of the family gym in the future with the power of human-machine interactive.",

Most of the shadow puppet figures are still imaginary, spread by ancients, or carved and painted by shadow puppet artists, without consideration of real dimensions or the appearance of human bodies. This study proposes an algorithm to transform 3D human models to 2D puppet figures for shadow puppets, including automatic location of feature points, automatic segmentation of 3D models, automatic extraction of 2D contours, automatic clothes matching, and animation. Experiment proves that more realistic and attractive figures and animations of the shadow puppet can be generated in real time with this algorithm.",

However, SEOA may easily trap into local optima when solving complex multimodal function optimisation problems. This paper proposes a novel social emotional optimisation algorithm, called GOSEOA, which performs the generalised opposition–based learning (GOBL) strategy with a certain probability during the evolution process. The proposed algorithm uses the generalised opposition–based learning strategy to transform the current population to a generalised opposition–based population. Accordingly, the current population and the generalised opposition–based population are simultaneously considered to increase the probability for finding the global optimum. Experiments conducted on a comprehensive set of benchmark functions indicate that GOSEOA can obtain promising performance on the majority of the test functions.",

      "abstract": "In the recent years, many hostile websites have been using polymorphic JavaScript in order to conceal its code. The virtual execution is considered to be effective to process and detect such types of JavaScript. However, a challenge often encountered with that approach is the mandatory preparation of very detail-oriented environments that may also require specific user-driven events for the malicious JavaScript to execute properly as it was designed to. This paper proposes a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on tree edit distance to recognize and categorize hostile JavaScript. Firstly, the JavaScript's abstract syntax tree is constructed to be structural analysis. Secondly, the similarity of two JavaScript is calculated by tree-matching algorithm based on tree edit distance. Finally, the hierarchical clustering of malicious JavaScript is determined by predefined threshold. Our promising results confirm the effectiveness of the approach.",

The method takes advantage of the characteristics of the neural network and introduces the reinforcement learning to find the relativity between the crawled web pages and the topic. When calculating the correlation, we just select the important tags of HTML makeup of the Web page, to analyze the web page's content and structure. The experiments show that our method improves the efficiency and accuracy clearly.",

A high concentration of active catalytic sites and an efficient electronic/ionic mixed conducting network generated by the nanostructure afford promising synergistic effects on the electrocatalytic characteristics for triiodide reduction. On the basis of these advantages, these nanostructured hybrid based cells deliver significantly enhanced photovoltaic performances. The efficiencies of devices employing VN–NG, TiN–NG and MoN–NG are 6.279%, 7.498% and 7.913% respectively, which are comparable with that of Pt devices (7.858%). Such a design strategy is facile, cost effective and versatile, thus it may be extended to other inexpensive platinum-free counter electrode materials.",

In this paper, we propose a Web text clustering algorithm (WTCA) based on DFSSM, which is our original work. The algorithm includes the training stage of SOM and the clustering stage. It can distinguish the most meaningful features from the Concept Space without the evaluation function. We applied the algorithm to the Chinese Modern Long-distance Education Network, and compared our work with some popular clustering algorithms. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of WTCA is better than that of the other three algorithms.",

      "abstract": "A graphene/titanium nitride (G/TiN) hybrid as an anode material of lithium ion batteries is prepared by a simple in situhydrolysis method combined with ammonia annealing. TiN nanoparticles as obtained are ∼5 nm in size and homogeneously anchored on G. The G/TiN hybrid anode delivers a reversible capacity as high as 646 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 and exhibits an enhanced initial coulombic efficiency of 75%, much higher than that of pure graphene (G: 52%) in the first cycle. The capacity retention is as much as 86% after 200 cycles. At a current density of 2000 mA g−1, the hybrid anode still retains 325 mA h g−1 while that of G is only 98 mA h g−1. It is demonstrated that the G/TiN hybrids display a superior electrochemical performance owing to the highly efficient mixed (electron and Li+) conducting network. The internal defects between G layers induced by nitrogen-doping in G/TiN may improve reversible Li storage, whereas the catalytic sites on the surface of G related to the decomposition of the electrolyte may be occupied by TiN, leading to a decreased irreversible capacity. Moreover, the formation of Li3N in the interface is beneficial to interface transport, which is confirmed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. The anchoring of TiN nanoparticles on G is promising prospect for energy storage applications in high performance lithium-ion batteries.",

A fractal stroke is a skeletal stroke that recursively copies, recolors and distorts its neighboring image and then paint on the canvas. Fractal strokes can generate self-similar textures. On one hand, the general visual attributes of a stroke are decided by the user. On the other hand, a stroke's fine details depend on its context. Many modifications can easily been made so that fractal strokes can probably generate various new results beyond the scope of traditional artistic techniques.",

Triangle descriptor is introduced to evaluate similarity of two triangles that integrates characteristic components of the minutiae triangle with global orientation field information. To reduce computational complexity of finding correspondent triangles, fingerprint image is separated into a series of circular areas utilizing the belief function of singular points. Seed triangles are searched in limited regions that are invariant to rotation and translation and robust to distortion of fingerprints. A set of experiments have been done on different database and the better performance has been achieved.",

      "abstract": "In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets serving as lithium storage materials are presented. The nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets were prepared by heat treatment of graphite oxide under an ammonia atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to characterize the prepared product as nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets with a doping level of ca. 2% nitrogen, where the N binding configuration of the graphene includes 57.4% pyridinic, 35.0% pyrrolic and 7.6% graphitic N atoms. Galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments revealed that these nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets exhibited a high reversible capacity (900 mA h g−1 at 42 mA g−1 (1/20 C)), excellent rate performance (250 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2.1 A g−1 (2.5 C)), and significantly enhanced cycling stability, which demonstrated nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets to be a promising candidate for anode materials in high rate lithium-ion batteries.",

For each main rhythm of the music, emotion-related features are extracted and 8 emotion labels are assigned to them, then we find the function between the label and the emotion-related features by GA-BP, BP and the classic GA. Experimental results show classifier based on GA-BP get the highest classification rate of 83.33%. Moreover, based on the definition of music emotion vector, we provided an exploring system for people to search for a song in a fuzzy way.",

      "abstract": "Music emotional design has been studied for many years, and there has been a growing interest in analyzing and design emotion in music by the evolutionary algorithms. Therefore, it's necessary to organize and categorize representative literature. The study presents an exhaustive survey of studies on one or more aspects of music emotional design by the evolutionary algorithms. In doing so, a classification of the literature based on the goal of what the studies want to achieve is developed. Such a classification not only highlights the significant results and unifies existing work, but also provides a foundation for future research in Music Emotional Design by the evolutionary algorithms.",

Based on this model, we implement an ant-colony clustering algorithm. What's more, k-means algorithm is also implemented in the phase, the result is compared with that of ant colony algorithm. Experiment results show that the algorithm is valid, it can effectively and accurately gain Web transactions clustering patterns.",

The result shows that it has well overcome the vari-ous kinds of problems exiting in the old ventilator and so the new ventilator is intelligent.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a music emotion cognition model by applying the improved genetic algorithm with dynamic mutation operator. Firstly, a Hevner emotion ring representing the music emotion space is presented by utilizing psychological fuzzy measure on words in music psychology. Secondly, the music emotion vector is introduced based on semantic similarity relation in computing with words. Then the mapping from high dimensional feature space of music to emotion space is built by using the genetic algorithm which can mine the emotion expressions. Finally the comparisons with some famous learning algorithms such as BP neural network, regression method with least square, show that the proposed method is effective for music emotion cognition.",

      "abstract": "Development of calligraphic robot is motivated by allowing humanoid robot and home service robot to mimic the writing skills of human beings. Similar to human beings, versatile sensors are involved in writing procedure of robot to percept stages of task fulfillment and status of writing-brush. It is well known that the structures of Chinese characters are very complex and delicate. The writing-brush is soft and can draw strokes of different and variable widths, which makes Chinese calligraphy a sort of art like painting. Since the relations of strokes of Chinese characters are complicated and the writing-brush is extremely intricate to handle that it might result in inconsistent strokes with even slight changes in environment, dynamic management of sensors is hence a critical issue for a successful writing of an elegant Chinese character. This paper presents a sensor management method based on fuzzy decision tree (FDT), with which necessary prerequisite knowledge of Chinese character writing can be integrated into control of calligraphic robot system. Properties of sensor management problem in calligraphic robot are analyzed. Implementation of the proposed method is discussed. Experiments evaluate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method.",

The control strategy based on DRNN is introduced to decouple the looper system. It can cope with changes in rolling conditions by controlling the rotational speed of the main motor in addition to the existing looper motor current. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness of this algorithm and after decoupled, the loopers' control performance gets much better.",

So it is indispensable for this DAC to deal with a role hierarchy that is predefined to enforce desired policies. Sandhu et al. use the RBAC96 model to simulate DAC but it cannot speak to a role hierarchy. Rather, their work has been of great significance in explaining the policy neutrality of the RBAC model. In this paper we present a DAC construction based on ARBAC02 that can cooperate with other policies and that meets some other requirements we suppose to be of importance.",

A M-FSM model was proposed for the multi-stage vulnerable operations. The goal of this M-FSM is to analyze how the implemented step-by-step operation, or more precisely each step activity within the whole operation, contributes to an attack goal. This model can be used to identify attack paths to critical network resources. From these attack paths an expression for network safety in terms of the initial configuration can be derived. Subsequently, the system manager can take measures to strengthen the network.",

      "abstract": "In this thesis, the applications of a new segmentation method, Constrained Deformable Contour Method (CDCM), to a sequence of two dimensional medical images for the purpose of extracting a three dimensional surface are performed.By evaluating the results quantitatively and qualitatively we examined the applicability and validation of the proposed method in several medical applications of abdominal fat, brain hippocampus and sub-brain structures of putamen, thalamus and caudate nucleus.Following the classical 'snakes' pattern the CDCM is an energy optimization process, where the interior information related to the intensity homogeneity is introduced as a constraint.Utilizing the fast marching level set into the contour marching process provides the geometrical advantage of merging and splitting.Acceptable illustration results are obtained when applying CDCM to segment abdominal fat, and sub-brain structures like putamen, thalamus and caudate nuclei.When this approach is applied to diminutive brain structures like hippocampus, which has an undistinguishing boundary on significant portions of its surface, the result is not as good as other objects.In conclusion our method is geometrically flexible, reproductive, and simple in terms of little human intervention and is insensitive to initial seed location in most medical image applications.Further work may be directed towards extending CDCM to 3D deformation surface extraction and making the method more insensitive to the parameter settings.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, software architecture for multisensor fusion system (MFS) in dynamic environment is described. The architecture has the characteristics of robustness, dynamically reconfigurable framework, plug-in-play for sensor, and predictability of sensor action. According to requirements of MFS, the real-time operating system (RTOS) is applied in this software architecture. The result is an RTOS-based software architecture, which consists of five kinds of tasks: sensor sampling task (SST), sensor data processing task (SDPT), fusion task (FT), management task (MT) and man/machine interface task (MMIT). A calligraphic robot has been designed and developed in our lab based on the software architecture proposed. The application of the architecture makes the sensor management of the calligraphic robot system easy.",
