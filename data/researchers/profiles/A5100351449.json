A strong longitudinal thread spans EEG-based emotion decoding, expressive speech modeling (including non-verbal cues and escalation detection), and behaviorally anchored digital interventions (e.g., VR games, collaborative turn-taking systems). Recent work emphasizes robustness—handling inconsistent labels, cross-domain adaptation, and inclusive modeling for atypical populations—while increasingly integrating LLMs, pre-trained vision-language models, and corpus development for affective AI. The trajectory shows a maturing integration of neuroscience, signal processing, clinical psychology, and human-centered AI design.",

      "abstract": "Omnidirectional depth estimation predicts 360-degree depth information using multiple fisheye cameras arranged in a surround-view configuration. However, due to the lack of reference panorama and differences between the predicted depth viewpoint and input cameras, it is challenging to construct and utilize semantic information to improve depth accuracy, resulting in limited accurate in complex regions such as non-overlapping, weak textures, object boundaries and occlusions. This paper proposes a novel model architecture that effectively extracts and leverages semantic information to enhance the accuracy of omnidirectional depth estimation. Specifically, the proposed algorithm combines the variance and mean of multi-view image features to construct the fused matching cost and utilize both geometry and semantic constraints. The model extracts 360-degree semantic context during matching cost aggregation, and predict the corresponding panoramas jointly with omnidirectional depth maps. A semantic-aware spatial propagation module is then employed to further refine the depth estimation. We leverage a multi-scale multi-task learning strategy to supervise the prediction of omnidirectional depth maps and panoramas jointly. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets, and also demonstrates high-precision results on real-world data. The experiments with varying camera configurations validate the generalization ability and flexibility of the algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.",

      "abstract": "Whispered speech lacks vocal-fold excitation and exhibits reduced energy and shifted formant frequencies, making natural and intelligible voice reconstruction highly challenging. To address this issue, we propose \\emph{WhisperVC}, a three-stage framework for Mandarin whisper-to-speech (W2S) conversion. Stage~1 employs a fine-tuned Content Encoder based on the OpenAI Whisper-large~V3 model and a Conformer-based variational autoencoder with soft-DTW alignment to learn domain-invariant and temporally consistent representations. Stage~2 introduces a deterministic Length--Channel Aligner and a duration-free FastSpeech~2 model conditioned on speaker embeddings for controllable timbre and stable prosody. Stage~3 fine-tunes a HiFi-GAN vocoder on predicted mel-spectrograms to synthesize high-fidelity waveforms. Experiments on the AISHELL6-Whisper corpus demonstrate that WhisperVC achieves near ground-truth quality (\\textbf{DNSMOS~3.11}, \\textbf{UTMOS~2.52}, \\textbf{CER~18.67\\%}), while maintaining speaker similarity (\\textbf{cosine~0.76}) and robust performance under whisper-only inference.",

      "abstract": "In natural language communication, emotions are often conveyed through non-verbal sounds (NVs), such as laughter, crying, cough and so on. However, most existing text-to-speech (TTS) corpora lack annotations for these non-verbal sounds, leading to a scarcity of systems capable of generating them. To address this gap, we introduce SMIIP-NV, a non-verbal speech synthesis corpus annotated with both emotions and non-verbal sounds, including laughter, crying, and cough. To the best of our knowledge, SMIIP-NV is the largest publicly available open-source expressive speech corpus that includes non-verbal speech and rich annotations. It comprises 33 hours of speech data, covering five distinct emotions and three types of non-verbal sounds, with detailed transcriptions and precise timestamps for each occurrence of non-verbal sounds. Additionally, the corpus provides annotations for speech segments that contain laughter or crying. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we establish a baseline for non-verbal speech synthesis by employing a lightweight large language model (LLM). The SMIIP-NV dataset and static audio demonstrations are publicly available at https://axunyii.github.io/SMIIP-NV. The interactive real-time ­ demonstrations can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/spaces/xunyi/SMIIP-NV_Finetuned_CosyVoice2.",

This study evaluates three automated paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First, we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869 for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content standards.}",

      "abstract": "Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments. Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT) calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items, training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures, can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806. The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.",

      "abstract": "Component-level audio Spoofing (Comp-Spoof) targets a new form of audio manipulation where only specific components of a signal, such as speech or environmental sound, are forged or substituted while other components remain genuine. Existing anti-spoofing datasets and methods treat an utterance or a segment as entirely bona fide or entirely spoofed, and thus cannot accurately detect component-level spoofing. To address this, we construct a new dataset, CompSpoof, covering multiple combinations of bona fide and spoofed speech and environmental sound. We further propose a separation-enhanced joint learning framework that separates audio components apart and applies anti-spoofing models to each one. Joint learning is employed, preserving information relevant for detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline, highlighting the necessity of separate components and the importance of detecting spoofing for each component separately.

      "abstract": "Driven by the rapid advancement of smart grid frameworks, the volume of visual data collected from power system diagnostic equipment has surged exponentially. A substantial portion of these images (30–40%) are redundant or highly similar, primarily due to periodic monitoring and repeated acquisitions from multiple angles. Traditional redundancy removal methods based on manual screening or single-feature matching are often inefficient and lack adaptability. In this paper, we propose a two-stage redundancy removal paradigm for power inspection imagery, which integrates abstract semantic priors with fine-grained perceptual details. The first stage combines an improved discrete cosine transform hash (DCT Hash) with the multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) to efficiently filter redundant candidates. In the second stage, a Vision Transformer network enhanced with a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism precisely determines redundancy via cosine similarity between feature vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an algorithm sensitivity of 0.9243, surpassing ResNet and VGG by 5.86 and 8.10 percentage points, respectively, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in large-scale power grid redundancy detection. These results underscore the paradigm’s capability to balance efficiency and precision in complex visual inspection scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The field produced fluid in Xinjiang Oilfield has the characteristics of medium-high temperature, high salinity and high calcium and magnesium ion concentration, which makes the solubility of calcium carbonate decrease due to pressure change, temperature change and water quality intersection during the development process, and precipitates calcium salt solids, which affects the development effect. In view of the above problems, this paper evaluates the scale inhibition effect of calcium carbonate on the scale inhibitors commonly used in oil fields, and carries out the experimental research on the long-term stability, temperature, salt content and calcium ion concentration of the selected high-temperature scale inhibitor KL-2. The results show that when the concentration of KL-2 is 0.08 %, the scale inhibition effect on calcium carbonate can reach 95.35 %, and the scale inhibition effect can be maintained for more than 30 days. The factors such as temperature, salt content and calcium ion concentration all affect the scale inhibition effect of KL-2, among which calcium ion concentration has the greatest influence. The theoretical KL-2 scale inhibitor dosing template was applied in the field of Xinjiang Oilfield, combined with the continuous dosing of scale inhibitor by metering pump, the problem of salt precipitation was effectively inhibited, with incomplete statistics. In 2024, the total amount of treated liquid will be nearly 30000m 3 / d.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Laryngeal high-speed video (HSV) is a widely used technique for diagnosing laryngeal diseases. Among various analytical approaches, segmentation of glottis regions has proven effective in evaluating vocal fold vibration patterns and detecting related disorders. However, the specific task of vocal fold segmentation remains underexplored in the literature. Methods In this study, we propose a novel automatic vocal fold segmentation system that relies solely on glottis information. The system leverages prompt engineering techniques tailored for the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Specifically, vocal fold-related features are extracted from U-Net-generated glottis masks, which are enhanced via brightness contrast adjustment and morphological closing. A coarse bounding box of the laryngeal region is also produced using the YOLO-v5 model. These components are integrated to form a bounding box prompt. Furthermore, a point prompt is derived by identifying local extrema in the first derivative of grayscale intensity along lines intersecting the glottis, offering additional guidance on vocal fold locations. Results Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method, which does not require labeled vocal fold training data, achieves competitive segmentation performance. The proposed approach reaches a Dice Coefficient of 0.91, which is comparable to fully supervised methods. Discussion Our results suggest that it is feasible to achieve accurate vocal fold segmentation using only glottis-based prompts and without supervised vocal fold annotations. Extracted features on the resulting masks further validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. To encourage further research, we release our code at: https://github.com/yucongzh/Laryngoscopic-Image-Segmentation-Toolkit .",

      "abstract": "This study investigates methods for item difficulty modeling in large-scale assessments using both small and large language models (LLMs). We introduce novel data augmentation strategies, including augmentation on the fly and distribution balancing, that surpass benchmark performances, demonstrating their effectiveness in mitigating data imbalance and improving model performance. Our results showed that fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and RoBERTa yielded lower root mean squared error than the first-place model in the BEA 2024 Shared Task competition, whereas domain-specific models like BioClinicalBERT and PubMedBERT did not provide significant improvements due to distributional gaps. Majority voting among SLMs enhanced prediction accuracy, reinforcing the benefits of ensemble learning. LLMs, such as GPT-4, exhibited strong generalization capabilities but struggled with item difficulty prediction, likely due to limited training data and the absence of explicit difficulty-related context. Chain-of-thought prompting and rationale generation approaches were explored but did not yield substantial improvements, suggesting that additional training data or more sophisticated reasoning techniques may be necessary. Embedding-based methods, particularly using NV-Embed-v2, showed promise but did not outperform our best augmentation strategies, indicating that capturing nuanced difficulty-related features remains a challenge.",

      "abstract": "Currently, research in deepfake speech detection focuses on the generalization of detection systems towards different spoofing methods, mainly for noise-free clean speech. However, the performance of speech anti-spoofing countermeasure (CM) systems often does not work well in more complicated scenarios, such as those involving noise and reverberation. To address the problem of enhancing the robustness of CM systems, we propose a transfer learning-based hybrid approach with Speech Enhancement front-end and Counter Measure back-end Joint optimization (SECM-Joint), investigating its effectiveness in improving robustness against noise and reverberation. Experimental results show that our SECM-Joint method reduces EER by 19.11% to 64.05% relatively in most noisy conditions and 23.23% to 30.67% relatively in reverberant environments compared to a Conformer-based CM baseline system without pre-training. Additionally, our dual-path U-Net (DUMENet) further enhances the robustness for real-world applications. These results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the robustness of CM systems in noisy and reverberant conditions.

However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.",

While serialized output training (SOT)-style methods serve as common solutions, they often discard absolute timing information, limiting their utility in time-sensitive scenarios. Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for conversational audio processing, we propose a novel diarization-aware multi-speaker ASR system that integrates speaker diarization with LLM-based transcription. Our framework processes structured diarization inputs alongside frame-level speaker and semantic embeddings, enabling the LLM to generate segment-level transcriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the system achieves robust performance in multilingual dyadic conversations and excels in complex, high-overlap multi-speaker meeting scenarios. This work highlights the potential of LLMs as unified back-ends for joint speaker-aware segmentation and transcription.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has established the caregiver skill training (CST) program, designed to empower families with children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder the essential caregiving skills. The joint engagement rating inventory (JERI) protocol evaluates participants’ engagement levels within the CST initiative. Traditionally, rating the expressive language level and use (EXLA) item in JERI relies on retrospective video analysis conducted by qualified professionals, thus incurring substantial labor costs. This study introduces a multimodal behavioral signal-processing framework designed to analyze both child and caregiver behaviors automatically, thereby rating EXLA. Initially, raw audio and video signals are segmented into concise intervals via voice activity detection, speaker diarization and speaker age classification, serving the dual purpose of eliminating nonspeech content and tagging each segment with its respective speaker. Subsequently, we extract an array of audio-visual features, encompassing our proposed interpretable, hand-crafted textual features, end-to-end audio embeddings and end-to-end video embeddings. Finally, these features are fused at the feature level to train a linear regression model aimed at predicting the EXLA scores. Our framework has been evaluated on the largest in-the-wild database currently available under the CST program. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.768 against the expert ratings, evidencing promising performance comparable to that of human experts.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> <bold>Background</bold> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors, often accompanied by comorbidities such as epilepsy, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal disorders (GIDs). The global prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing, resulting in significant lifelong treatment costs and substantial societal burdens, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapeutic intervention. Conventional rehabilitation therapies often exhibit limited efficacy and slow progress, particularly in the treatment of comorbid conditions. In recent years, the ketogenic diet (KD) has emerged as a promising intervention, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in managing ASD symptoms in children. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a modified ketogenic diet in children with ASD through a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, thereby providing a clinical foundation for expanding treatment strategies. <bold>Methods</bold> A total of 62 children diagnosed with ASD and admitted to Hefei Maternal and Child Health Hospital between January 2024 and January 2025 were prospectively enrolled in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group using a randomized numerical table method, with 31 children in each group. The treatment group received a modified ketogenic diet (comprising ketogenic nutritional powder and an intervention diet) combined with standard rehabilitation training, while the control group received a normal diet alongside routine rehabilitation training. After a two-month intervention period, changes in autism-related symptoms were assessed using the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Pre- and post-treatment scores were compared between the two groups. <bold>Results</bold> Baseline characteristics, including sex, age, ABC scores, and CARS scores, showed no significant differences between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). Following the two-month intervention, both groups exhibited significant improvements in ABC and CARS scores compared to their baseline values (P &lt; 0.05). However, the treatment group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in both ABC (U = 195.500, P &lt; 0.05) and CARS scores (U = 190.500, P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group, indicating superior therapeutic efficacy. <bold>Conclusions</bold> The modified ketogenic diet, when combined with rehabilitation intervention training, significantly alleviated core symptoms in children with ASD. This approach represents a viable alternative to the classical ketogenic model, with the added advantage of high patient compliance. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term benefits and mechanisms underlying this dietary intervention. <bold>Trial registration</bold>: The Project was registered on MRCTS with the identifier MR-44-23-041122.

      "abstract": "Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in fundamental cross-modality research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily faces two challenges: $\\textbf{(1)}$ $\\textbf{fragmentation development}$, with existing methods failing to unify understanding and generation into a single one, hindering the way to artificial general intelligence. $\\textbf{(2) lack of fine-grained facial attributes}$, which are crucial for high-fidelity applications. To handle those issues, we propose $\\textbf{UniF$^2$ace}$, $\\textit{the first UMM specifically tailored for fine-grained face understanding and generation}$. $\\textbf{First}$, we introduce a novel theoretical framework with a Dual Discrete Diffusion (D3Diff) loss, unifying masked generative models with discrete score matching diffusion and leading to a more precise approximation of the negative log-likelihood. Moreover, this D3Diff significantly enhances the model's ability to synthesize high-fidelity facial details aligned with text input. $\\textbf{Second}$, we propose a multi-level grouped Mixture-of-Experts architecture, adaptively incorporating the semantic and identity facial embeddings to complement the attribute forgotten phenomenon in representation evolvement. $\\textbf{Finally}$, to this end, we construct UniF$^2$aceD-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 130K fine-grained image-caption pairs and 1M visual question-answering pairs, spanning a much wider range of facial attributes than existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing models with a similar scale in both understanding and generation tasks, with 7.1\\% higher Desc-GPT and 6.6\\% higher VQA-score, respectively.",

      "abstract": "While existing anomaly synthesis methods have made remarkable progress, achieving both realism and diversity in synthesis remains a major obstacle. To address this, we propose AnomalyPainter, a zero-shot framework that breaks the diversity-realism trade-off dilemma through synergizing Vision Language Large Model (VLLM), Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), and our newly introduced texture library Tex-9K. Tex-9K is a professional texture library containing 75 categories and 8,792 texture assets crafted for diverse anomaly synthesis. Leveraging VLLM's general knowledge, reasonable anomaly text descriptions are generated for each industrial object and matched with relevant diverse textures from Tex-9K. These textures then guide the LDM via ControlNet to paint on normal images. Furthermore, we introduce Texture-Aware Latent Init to stabilize the natural-image-trained ControlNet for industrial images. Extensive experiments show that AnomalyPainter outperforms existing methods in realism, diversity, and generalization, achieving superior downstream performance.",

      "abstract": "The conventional approach to elder care is no longer able to satisfy the rising need for medical attention for the elderly due to China’s aging population. The demographic trait of “getting old before getting rich” presents a challenge to the distribution of social healthcare resources, as this article first examines the current pattern of changes in the composition of the older population. The community-based “healthcare integration” paradigm of senior care services has emerged as a successful remedy in this regard. Drawing on biomechanical principles, we can envision the community healthcare system as a complex “biomechanical network”. In order to categorize and predict the health data of the elderly, this study constructs a mathematical model akin to analyzing biomechanical forces and movements. By employing methods similar to optimizing structural loads, such as the CART decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) optimization, we enhance the model’s precision. Just as biomechanical systems adapt to varying loads, our model adapts to handle complex health data. By building the optimal classification plane of the support vector machine and adding relaxation variables, the model application solves the classification problem of linearly indivisible data, further enhancing the model’s accuracy and effectiveness, much like how a biomechanical structure self-adjusts to external pressures. In this paper, a geriatric health service platform based on information technology, including big data and the Internet of Things (IoT), is formed. The service system is a tripartite linkage disease management service model that covers the synergistic cooperation of community hospitals, third-party enterprises, and the streets where they are located. A prediction model for common cases, such heart disease, was developed by preprocessing and cleaning the data of 2311 valid samples from the China Geriatrics Center. The dataset was then characterized. The findings demonstrate the model’s high operability and accuracy in predicting health and managing long-term care for older people who are mobility. In the context of an aging society, by integrating biomechanical insights into the design of this healthcare model, the research not only establishes a theoretical foundation for community health care integration but also provides valuable references for implementing digital senior care services and enhancing health management for the elderly in an aging society.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization (S2SND) framework to perform online and offline speaker diarization. It is developed from the sequence-to-sequence architecture of our previous target-speaker voice activity detection system and then evolves into a new diarization paradigm by addressing two critical problems. 1) Speaker Detection: The proposed approach can utilize partially given speaker embeddings to discover the unknown speaker and predict the target voice activities in the audio signal. It does not require a prior diarization system for speaker enrollment in advance. 2) Speaker Representation: The proposed approach can adopt the predicted voice activities as reference information to extract speaker embeddings from the audio signal simultaneously. The representation space of speaker embedding is jointly learned within the whole diarization network without using an extra speaker embedding model. During inference, the S2SND framework can process long audio recordings blockwise. The detection module utilizes the previously obtained speaker-embedding buffer to predict both enrolled and unknown speakers' voice activities for each coming audio block. Next, the speaker-embedding buffer is updated according to the predictions of the representation module. Assuming that up to one new speaker may appear in a small block shift, our model iteratively predicts the results of each block and extracts target embeddings for the subsequent blocks until the signal ends. Finally, the last speaker-embedding buffer can re-score the entire audio, achieving highly accurate diarization performance as an offline system. Experimental results show that our proposed S2SND framework achieves new state-of-the-art diarization error rates (DERs) for online inference on the DIHARD-II (24.41%) and DIHARD-III (17.12%) evaluation sets without using oracle voice activity detection. At the same time, it also refreshes the state-of-the-art performance for offline inference on these benchmarks, with DERs of 21.95% and 15.13%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Audio-visual learning has demonstrated promising results in many classical speech tasks (e.g., speech separation, automatic speech recognition, wake-word spotting). We believe that introducing visual modality will also benefit speaker diarization. To date, Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) plays an important role in highly accurate speaker diarization. However, previous TS-VAD models take audio features and utilize the speaker’s acoustic footprint to distinguish his or her personal speech activities, which is easily affected by overlapped speech in multi-speaker scenarios. Although visual information naturally tolerates overlapped speech, it suffers from spatial occlusion, low resolution, etc. The potential modality-missing problem blocks TS-VAD towards an audio-visual approach. This paper proposes a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (MIMO-TSVAD) framework for speaker diarization. The proposed method can take audio-visual input and leverage the speaker’s acoustic footprint or lip track to flexibly conduct audio-based, video-based, and audio-visual speaker diarization in a unified sequence-to-sequence framework. Experimental results show that the MIMO-TSVAD framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the VoxConverse, DIHARD-III, and MISP 2022 datasets under corresponding evaluation metrics, obtaining the Diarization Error Rates (DERs) of 4.18%, 10.10%, and 8.15%, respectively. In addition, it can perform robustly in heavy lip-missing scenarios.",

Serious fisheye lens distortion in the peripheral region of the image leads to degraded performance of the existing head pose estimation models trained on undistorted images. This article presents a new approach for head pose estimation that uses the knowledge of head location in the image to reduce the negative effect of fisheye distortion. We develop an end-to-end convolutional neural network to estimate the head pose with the multitask learning of head pose and head location. Our proposed network estimates the head pose directly from the fisheye image without the operation of rectification or calibration. We also created a fisheye-distorted version of the three popular head pose estimation datasets, BIWI, 300W-LP, and AFLW2000 for our experiments. Experimental results show that our network remarkably improves the accuracy of head pose estimation compared with other state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage methods.",

      "abstract": "The unpredictability of the wireless channel has been used as a natural source of randomness to build physical-layer security primitives for shared key generation, authentication, access control, proximity verification, and other security properties. Compared to pseudo-random generators, it has the potential to achieve information-theoretic security. In sub-6 GHz frequencies, the randomness is harvested from the small-scale fading effects of RF signal propagation in rich scattering environments. However, the RF propagation characteristics follow sparse models with clustered paths when devices operate in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands (5G and Next-Generation networks, Wi-Fi in 60GHz). Millimeter-wave transmissions are typically directional to increase the gain and combat high signal attenuation, leading to stable and more predictable channels. In this paper, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods relying on channel state information or received signal strength measurements fail to produce high randomness. Accounting for the unique features of mmWave propagation, we propose a novel randomness extraction mechanism that exploits the random timing of channel blockage to harvest random bits. Compared with the prior art in CSI-based and context-based randomness extraction, our protocol remains secure against <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">passive and active Man-in-the-Middle adversaries co-located with the legitimate devices</i>. We demonstrate the security properties of our method in a 28 GHz mmWave testbed in an indoor setting.",

In order to adapt to this change, the training model for medical imaging technology professionals is in urgent need of innovation and optimization. Based on social needs and technological development trends, this study proposes to establish the AI concept, constructs a multi-level curriculum system based on the integration of \"post course competition and certification\" training goals, promotes professional practice with vocational skills competitions, and builds a skills certificate as the foothold. The talent training mechanism that emphasizes both education and training provide reference and reference for the reform of the talent training model for medical imaging technology professionals.",

However, training large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to memory and computational constraints. This paper describes our TTS method for the 2024 Conversational Voice Clone Challenge (CoVoC). Our approach modifies the LauraGPT model to synthesize mixed Chinese and English text by expanding the Chinese pinyin vocabulary and reducing the number of layers in the decoder-only Transformer architecture. Despite using minimal training data, the performance gap between our method and other constrained systems is relatively small in both subjective and some objective evaluations. This paper discusses our attempt to train lightweight LLMs for zero-shot TTS and analyzes the factors contributing to low performance.

      "abstract": "Background Electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely used in emotion recognition due to its precision and reliability. However, the nonstationarity of EEG signals causes significant differences between individuals or sessions, making it challenging to construct a robust model. Recently, domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown excellent results in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition by aligning marginal distributions. Nevertheless, these methods do not consider emotion category labels, which can lead to label confusion during alignment. Our study aims to alleviate this problem by promoting conditional distribution alignment during domain adaptation to improve cross-subject and cross-session emotion recognition performance. Method This study introduces a multi-source domain adaptation common-branch network for EEG emotion recognition and proposes a novel sample hybridization method. This method enables the introduction of target domain data information by directionally hybridizing source and target domain samples without increasing the overall sample size, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of conditional distribution alignment in domain adaptation. Cross-subject and cross-session experiments were conducted on two publicly available datasets, SEED and SEED-IV, to validate the proposed model. Result In cross-subject emotion recognition, our method achieved an average accuracy of 90.27% on the SEED dataset, with eight out of 15 subjects attaining a recognition accuracy higher than 90%. For the SEED-IV dataset, the recognition accuracy also reached 73.21%. Additionally, in the cross-session experiment, we sequentially used two out of the three session data as source domains and the remaining session as the target domain for emotion recognition. The proposed model yielded average accuracies of 94.16 and 75.05% on the two datasets, respectively. Conclusion Our proposed method aims to alleviate the difficulties of emotion recognition from the limited generalization ability of EEG features across subjects and sessions. Though adapting the multi-source domain adaptation and the sample hybridization method, the proposed method can effectively transfer the emotion-related knowledge of known subjects and achieve accurate emotion recognition on unlabeled subjects.",

      "abstract": "We propose TSELM, a novel target speaker extraction network that leverages discrete tokens and language models. TSELM utilizes multiple discretized layers from WavLM as input tokens and incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to integrate target speaker information. Language models are employed to capture the sequence dependencies, while a scalable HiFi-GAN is used to reconstruct the audio from the tokens. By applying a cross-entropy loss, TSELM models the probability distribution of output tokens, thus converting the complex regression problem of audio generation into a classification task. Experimental results show that TSELM achieves excellent results in speech quality and comparable results in speech intelligibility.",

      "abstract": "Target speaker extraction aims to separate the voice of a specific speaker from mixed speech. Traditionally, this process has relied on extracting a speaker embedding from a reference speech, in which a speaker recognition model is required. However, identifying an appropriate speaker recognition model can be challenging, and using the target speaker embedding as reference information may not be optimal for target speaker extraction tasks. This paper introduces a Universal Speaker Embedding-Free Target Speaker Extraction (USEF-TSE) framework that operates without relying on speaker embeddings. USEF-TSE utilizes a multi-head cross-attention mechanism as a frame-level target speaker feature extractor. This innovative approach allows mainstream speaker extraction solutions to bypass the dependency on speaker recognition models and better leverage the information available in the enrollment speech, including speaker characteristics and contextual details. Additionally, USEF-TSE can seamlessly integrate with other time-domain or time-frequency domain speech separation models to achieve effective speaker extraction. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) on the WSJ0-2mix, WHAM!, and WHAMR! datasets, which are standard benchmarks for monaural anechoic, noisy and noisy-reverberant two-speaker speech separation and speaker extraction. The results on the LibriMix and the blind test set of the ICASSP 2023 DNS Challenge demonstrate that the model performs well on more diverse and out-of-domain data.

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents challenges in social interaction skill development, particularly in turn-taking. Digital interventions offer potential solutions for improving autistic children's social skills but often lack addressing specific collaboration techniques. Therefore, we designed a prototype of a turn-taking collaborative tablet game, StarRescue, which encourages children's distinct collaborative roles and interdependence while progressively enhancing sharing and mutual planning skills. We further conducted a controlled study with 32 autistic children to evaluate StarRescue's usability and potential effectiveness in improving their social skills. Findings indicated that StarRescue has great potential to foster turn-taking skills and social communication skills (e.g., prompting, negotiation, task allocation) within the game and also extend beyond the game. Additionally, we discussed implications for future work, such as including parents as game spectators and understanding autistic children's territory awareness in collaboration. Our study contributes a promising digital intervention for autistic children's turn-taking social skill development via a scaffolding approach and valuable design implications for future research.",

      "abstract": "One potential way to enhance the performance of facial expression recognition (FER) is to augment the training set by increasing the number of samples. By incorporating multiple FER datasets, deep learning models can extract more discriminative features. However, the inconsistent labeling criteria and subjective biases found in annotated FER datasets can significantly hinder the recognition accuracy of deep learning models when handling mixed datasets. Effectively perform joint training on multiple datasets remains a challenging task. In this study, we propose a joint training method for training an FER model using multiple FER datasets. Our method consists of four steps: (1) selecting a subset from the additional dataset, (2) generating pseudo-continuous labels for the target dataset, (3) refining the labels of different datasets using continuous label mapping and discrete label relabeling according to the labeling criteria of the target dataset, and (4) jointly training the model using multi-task learning. We conduct joint training experiments on two popular in-the-wild FER benchmark databases, RAF-DB and CAER-S, while utilizing the AffectNet dataset as an additional dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the direct merging of different FER datasets into a single training set and achieves state-of-the-art performance on RAF-DB and CAER-S with accuracies of 92.24% and 94.57%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a large-scale and high-quality audiovisual speaker verification dataset, named VoxBlink. We propose an innovative and robust automatic audio-visual data mining pipeline to curate this dataset, which contains 1.45M utterances from 38K speakers. Due to the inherent nature of automated data collection, introducing noisy data is inevitable. Therefore, we also utilize a multi-modal purification step to generate a cleaner version of the VoxBlink, named VoxBlink-clean, comprising 18K identities and 1.02M utterances. In contrast to the VoxCeleb, the VoxBlink sources from short videos of ordinary users, and the covered scenarios can better align with real-life situations. To our best knowledge, the VoxBlink dataset is one of the largest publicly available speaker verification datasets. Leveraging the VoxCeleb and VoxBlink-clean datasets together, we employ diverse speaker verification models with multiple architectural backbones to conduct comprehensive evaluations on the VoxCeleb test sets. Experimental results indicate a substantial enhancement in performance—ranging from 12% to 30% relatively—across various backbone architectures upon incorporating the VoxBlink-clean into the training process. The details of the dataset can be found on $\\color{Fuchsia} {{\\text{Site}}}$.",

      "abstract": "Personal voice activity detection (PVAD) is gradually used in speech assistants. Traditional PVAD schemes extract the target speaker's embedding from existing query reference speech through a pre-trained speaker verification model. Consequently, the performance of the PVAD model may suffer if the quality of the extracted speaker embedding is poor, such as when only utilizing wake word speech as the reference. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient PVAD model. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on speaker embeddings extracted from a pre-trained speaker verification model, our proposed method directly uses the raw frame-level features of the reference speech as the target speaker's attributes. In this way, our proposed model achieves an ultra-high recall rate, which is vital for speech assistant applications. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method in both cases of using existing query speech or wake word speech as reference.",

In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling method named Multi-objective Progressive Clustering (MoPC), specifically designed for semi-supervised domain adaptation. Firstly, we utilize limited labeled data from the target domain to derive domain-specific descriptors based on multiple distinct objectives, namely within-graph denoising, intra-class denoising and inter-class denoising. Then, the Infomap algorithm is adopted for embedding clustering, and the descriptors are leveraged to further refine the target domain's pseudo-labels. Moreover, to further improve the quality of pseudo labels, we introduce the subcenter-purification and progressive-merging strategy for label denoising. Our proposed MoPC method achieves 4.95% EER and ranked the 1 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup> place on the evaluation set of VoxSRC 2023 track 3. We also conduct additional experiments on the FFSVC dataset and yield promising results.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative deep learning framework for parallel voice conversion to mitigate inherent risks associated with such systems. Our approach focuses on developing an invertible model capable of countering potential spoofing threats. Specifically, we present a conversion model that allows for the retrieval of source voices, thereby facilitating the identification of the source speaker. This framework is constructed using a series of invertible modules composed of affine coupling layers to ensure the reversibility of the conversion process. We conduct comprehensive training and evaluation of the proposed framework using parallel training data. Our experimental results reveal that this approach achieves comparable performance to non-invertible systems in voice conversion tasks. Notably, the converted outputs can be seamlessly reverted to the original source inputs using the same parameters employed during the forwarding process. This advancement holds considerable promise for elevating the security and reliability of voice conversion.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that unifies Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization in a cohesive framework. Utilizing the synergies between the two tasks, our method effectively extracts speaker-specific information from the lower layers of a pretrained Conformer-based ASR model while leveraging the higher layers for enhanced diarization performance. In particular, the integration of ASR contextual details into the diarization process has been demonstrated to be effective. Results on the DIHARD III dataset indicate that our approach achieves a Diarization Error Rate (DER) of 10.52%, which can be further reduced to 10.39% when integrating ASR features into the diarization model. These findings highlight the potential of our approach, suggesting competitive performance against other state-of-the-art systems. Additionally, our framework's ability to simultaneously generate text transcripts for each speaker marks a distinct advantage, which can further enhance ASR capabilities and transition towards an end-to-end multitask framework encompassing both ASR and speaker diarization.",

This task presents challenges due to data imbalance, similarity in boundary content, and real‐time detection requirements. Here, a novel Time‐Attentive Fusion Network is introduced to address the requirements of improved action detection accuracy and operational efficiency. The time‐attentive fusion module is proposed, which consists of long‐term memory attention and the fusion feature learning mechanism, to improve spatial‐temporal feature learning. The temporal memory attention mechanism captures more effective temporal dependencies by employing weighted linear attention. The fusion feature learning mechanism facilitates the incorporation of current moment action information with historical data, thus enhancing the representation. The proposed method exhibits linear complexity and parallelism, enabling rapid training and inference speed. This method is evaluated on two challenging datasets: THUMOS’14 and ActivityNet v1.3. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state‐of‐the‐art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and inference speed.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, neural network-based Wake Word Spotting achieves good performance on clean audio samples but struggles in noisy environments. Audio-Visual Wake Word Spotting (AVWWS) receives lots of attention because visual lip movement information is not affected by complex acoustic scenes. Previous works usually use simple addition or concatenation for multi-modal fusion. The inter-modal correlation remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel module called Frame-Level Cross-Modal Attention (FLCMA) to improve the performance of AVWWS systems. This module can help model multi-modal information at the frame-level through synchronous lip movements and speech signals. We train the end-to-end FLCMA based Audio-Visual Conformer and further improve the performance by fine-tuning pre-trained uni-modal models for the AVWWS task. The proposed system achieves a new state-of-the-art result (4.57% WWS score) on the far-field MISP dataset.",

      "abstract": "Numerous children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit abnormal eye gaze pattern in communication and social interaction. In this study, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of the hide-and-seek virtual reality system (HSVRS) in improving gaze fixation abilities in children with ASD. Our hypothesis is that engaging in a hide-and-seek game within a virtual environment, particularly with a customized avatar resembling a familiar figure, would significantly enhance gaze fixation skills compared to traditional interventions without supplementary virtual reality (VR) intervention. In total, 36 children with ASD were involved in this pilot study in three groups: the avatar customized group, the avatar uncustomized group, and the control group. The control group only received human intervention, while the avatar group received additional VR-assisted interventions. The effect of HSVRS was measured by a six-point Likert subjective questionnaire and demonstrated significant improvements in gaze fixation abilities in the VR-assisted intervention groups compared to the control group (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P$</tex-math></inline-formula> = 0.006, 0.001). Moreover, the avatar customized group, which interacted with a familiar-looking avatar, obtained noticeable increments in gaze fixation metrics (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P$</tex-math></inline-formula> = 0.036, 0.005, 0.001). Experimental results show the effectiveness of utilizing VR technology to complement regular interventions in terms of improving gaze fixation abilities for young children with ASD.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the application of Conformers in speaker verification. Conformers, initially designed for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), excel at modeling both local and global contexts within speech signals effectively. Building on this synergistic relationship, this study introduces three strategies for leveraging ASR-pretrained Conformers in speaker verification: (1) Transfer learning: We use a pretrained ASR Conformer encoder to initialize the speaker embedding network, thereby enhancing model generalization and mitigating the risk of overfitting. (2) Knowledge distillation: We distill the complex capabilities of an ASR Conformer into a speaker verification model. This not only allows for flexibility in the student mode's network architecture but also incorporates frame-level ASR distillation loss as an auxiliary task to reinforce speaker verification. (3) Parameter-efficient transfer learning with speaker adaptation: A lightweight speaker adaptation module is proposed to convert ASR-derived features into speaker-specific embeddings, without altering the core architecture of the original ASR Conformer. This strategy facilitates the concurrent execution of ASR and speaker verification tasks within a singular model. Experiments were conducted on VoxCeleb datasets. The best model using the ASR pretraining method achieved a 0.43% equal error rate (EER) on the VoxCeleb1-O test trial, while the knowledge distillation approach yielded a 0.38% EER. Furthermore, by adding a mere 4.92 million parameters to a 130.94 million-parameter ASR Conformer encoder, the speaker adaptation approach achieved a 0.45% EER, enabling parallel speech recognition and speaker verification within a single ASR Conformer encoder. Overall, our techniques successfully transfer rich ASR knowledge to advanced speaker modeling.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes an online target speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) system for speaker diarization tasks that does not rely on prior knowledge from clustering-based diarization systems to obtain target speaker embeddings. By adapting conventional TS-VAD for real-time operation, our framework identifies speaker activities using self-generated embeddings, ensuring consistent performance and avoiding permutation inconsistencies during inference. In the inference phase, we employ a front-end model to extract frame-level speaker embeddings for each incoming signal block. Subsequently, we predict each speaker's detection state based on these frame-level embeddings and the previously estimated target speaker embeddings. The target speaker embeddings are then updated by aggregating the frame-level embeddings according to the current block's predictions. Our model predicts results block-by-block and iteratively updates target speaker embeddings until reaching the end of the signal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms offline clustering-based diarization systems on the DIHARD III and AliMeeting datasets. Additionally, this approach is extended to multi-channel data, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art offline diarization systems.",

      "abstract": "The performance of speaker verification systems can be adversely affected by time domain variations. However, limited research has been conducted on time-varying speaker verification due to the absence of appropriate datasets. This paper aims to investigate the impact of long-term and short-term time-varying in speaker verification and proposes solutions to mitigate these effects. For long-term speaker verification (i.e., cross-age speaker verification), we introduce an age-decoupling adversarial learning method to learn age-invariant speaker representation by mining age information from the VoxCeleb dataset. For short-term speaker verification, we collect the SMIIP-TimeVarying (SMIIP-TV) Dataset, which includes recordings at multiple time slots every day from 373 speakers for 90 consecutive days and other relevant meta information. Using this dataset, we analyze the time-varying of speaker embeddings and propose a novel but realistic time-varying speaker verification task, termed incremental sequence-pair speaker verification. This task involves continuous interaction between enrollment audios and a sequence of testing audios with the aim of improving performance over time. We introduce the template updating method to counter the negative effects over time, and then formulate the template updating processing as a Markov Decision Process and propose a template updating method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The policy network of DRL is treated as an agent to determine if and how much should the template be updated. In summary, this paper releases our collected database, investigates both the long-term and short-term time-varying scenarios and provides insights and solutions into time-varying speaker verification.",

      "abstract": "Although Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has made great strides with Text-to-Speech (TTS) techniques, multilingual singing voice modeling remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents BiSinger, a bilingual pop SVS system for English and Chinese Mandarin. Current systems require separate models per language and cannot accurately represent both Chinese and English, hindering code-switch SVS. To address this gap, we design a shared representation between Chinese and English singing voices, achieved by using the CMU dictionary with mapping rules. We fuse monolingual singing datasets with open-source singing voice conversion techniques to generate bilingual singing voices while also exploring the potential use of bilingual speech data. Experiments affirm that our language-independent representation and incorporation of related datasets enable a single model with enhanced performance in English and code-switch SVS while maintaining Chinese song performance. Audio samples are available at https://bisinger-svs.github.io.",

      "abstract": "Most multi-channel speaker extraction schemes use the target speaker's location information as a reference, which must be known in advance or derived from visual cues. In addition, memory and computation costs are enormous when the model deals with the fusion input. In this paper, we propose Speaker-extraction-and-filter Network (SeafNet), which is a low-complexity multi-channel speaker extraction network with only speech cues. Specifically, the SeafNet separates the mixture by utilizing the correlation between an estimation of target speaker on reference channel and the mixed input on rest channels. Experimental results show that compared with the baseline, the SeafNet model achieves 6.4% relative SISNRi improvement on the fixed geometry array and 8.9% average relative SISNRi improvement on the ad-hoc array. Meanwhile, the SeafNet achieves 60% relative reduction in the number of parameters and 42% relative reduction in the computational cost.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has instituted the Caregiver Skill Training (CST) program to assist families with children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI) protocol evaluates participants' engagement levels within the CST initiative. Traditionally, JERI assessments rely on retrospective video analysis conducted by qualified professionals, thus incurring substantial labor costs. This study aims to augment the evaluation efficiency of the Expressive Language Level and Use (EXLA) criterion within JERI, striving for consistency with human-based scoring. To this end, we introduce a multimodal behavioral signal-processing framework designed to analyze both child and caregiver behaviors, thereby offering grading recommendations as an alternative to medical professional input. Initially, raw audio and video signals are segmented into concise intervals via voice activity detection, speaker diarization and speaker age classification, serving the dual purpose of eliminating non-speech content and tagging each segment with its respective speaker. Subsequently, we extract an array of audio-visual features, encompassing our proposed interpretable, hand-crafted textual features, end-to-end audio embeddings and end-to-end video embeddings. Finally, these features are fused at the feature level to train a linear regression model aimed at predicting the EXLA scores. Our framework has been evaluated on the largest in-the-wild database currently available under the CST program. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system achieves a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.713 against the expert ratings, evidencing performance comparable to that of human experts. This approach not only provides immediate feedback for CST participants but also optimizes resource allocation in less developed regions.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Purpose: This cross-sectional study aimed to depict expressive language profiles and clarify lexical–grammatical interrelationships in Mandarin-speaking preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during the administration of the simplified Chinese Psychoeducational Profile–Third Edition screening. Method: We collected naturalistic language samples from 81 (74 boys, seven girls) 2- to 7-year-old ( M age = 55.6 months, SD = 15.17) Mandarin-speaking children with ASD in clinician–child interactions. The child participants were divided into five age subgroups with 12-month intervals according to their chronological age. Computer-assisted part-of-speech tagging, constituency analysis, and dependency analysis addressed the developmental trajectories of early lexical and grammatical growth in each age subgroup. Results: Significant within-ASD differences were observed in content words, function words, and lexical categories. Nouns and verbs were the predominant lexical categories, while noun types overwhelmed verb types in children over 3 years old. The grammatical development of 5- to 6-year-old Mandarin-speaking children with ASD was better than that of 3- to 4-year-old children. The trends of syntactic structures, grammatical relations, and grammatical complexity in each age group were similar. Conclusions: Mandarin-speaking preschoolers with ASD produce more lexicons with increasing age. They preserve the noun bias as a universal mechanism in early lexical learning. Moreover, their developmental trajectories of grammatical growth were comparable in each age subgroup. In addition, their lexicons and grammar were synchronically developed during early language acquisition.",

An increasing number of algorithms for emotion recognition have been proposed recently. However, it is still challenging to make efficient use of emotional activity knowledge. In this paper, based on prior knowledge that emotion varies slowly across time, we propose a temporal-difference minimizing neural network (TDMNN) for EEG emotion recognition. We use maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) technology to evaluate the difference in EEG features across time and minimize the difference by a multibranch convolutional recurrent network. State-of-the-art performances are achieved using the proposed method on the SEED, SEED-IV, DEAP and DREAMER datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of including prior knowledge in EEG emotion recognition.",

Existing RST parsing pipelines construct rhetorical structures without the knowledge of document-level content structures, which causes relatively low performance when predicting the discourse relations for large text spans. Recognizing the value of high-level content-related information in facilitating discourse relation recognition, we propose a novel pipeline for RST-DP that incorporates structure-aware news content sentence representations derived from the task of News Discourse Profiling. By incorporating only a few additional layers, this enhanced pipeline exhibits promising performance across various RST parsing metrics.",

      "abstract": "Transformer-based network architectures have gradually replaced convolutional neural networks in computer vision. Compared with convolutional neural networks, Transformer is able to learn global information of images and has better feature extraction capability. However, due to the lack of inductive bias, vision Transformers require a large amount of data for pre-training, such as ViT. Local-based Transformers effectively reduce the computational complexity, but could not establish long-range dependencies and do not perform as well on small-scale datasets. In response to these problems, OPSe Transformer is proposed. A global attention calculation module is designed to be added behind each stage of the vision Transformer, using a slightly larger and overlapping key patch and value patch to enhance the exchange of information between two adjacent windows and to aggregate global information in the local Transformer. In addition, a self-supervised learning proxy task is added to the architecture, corresponding to the loss function of the proxy task to constrain the training of the model on the dataset, so that the vision Transformer can learn spatial information within an image and improve the training effect of the network. Comparative experiments are conducted on the tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, and other datasets, and the experimental results show that compared with the baseline algorithm, our model improves the accuracy by up to 3.91%.",

However, a voice conversion system could manipulate a person's speech signal to make it sound like another speaker's voice and deceive the speaker verification system. Most countermeasures for voice conversion-based spoofing attacks are designed to discriminate bona fide speech from spoofed speech for speaker verification systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of source speaker identification – inferring the identity of the source speaker given the voice converted speech. To perform source speaker identification, we simply add voice-converted speech data with the label of source speaker identity to the genuine speech dataset during speaker embedding network training. Experimental results show the feasibility of source speaker identification when training and testing with converted speeches from the same voice conversion model(s). In addition, our results demonstrate that having more converted utterances from various voice conversion model for training helps improve the source speaker identification performance on converted utterances from unseen voice conversion models.",

This paper presents a novel Sequence-to-Sequence Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (Seq2Seq-TSVAD) method that can efficiently address the joint modeling of large-scale speakers and predict high-resolution voice activities. Experimental results show that larger speaker capacity and higher output resolution can significantly reduce the diarization error rate (DER), which achieves the new state-of-the-art performance of 4.55% on the VoxConverse test set and 10.77% on Track 1 of the DIHARD-III evaluation set under the widely-used evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes to pretrain Conformer with automatic speech recognition (ASR) task for speaker verification. Conformer combines convolution neural network (CNN) and Transformer model for modeling local and global features, respectively. Recently, multi-scale feature aggregation Conformer (MFA-Conformer) has been proposed for automatic speaker verification. MFA-Conformer concatenates frame-level outputs from all Conformer blocks for further pooling. However, our experiments show that Conformer can be easily overfitted with limited speaker recognition training data. To avoid overfitting, we propose to transfer the knowledge learned from ASR to speaker verification. Specifically, an ASR pretrained Conformer is used to initialize the training of MFA-Conformer for speaker verification. Our experiments show that pretraining Conformer with ASR leads to significant performance gains across model sizes. The best model achieves 0.48%, 0.71% and 1.54% EER on Voxceleb1-O, Voxceleb1-E, and Voxceleb1-H, respectively.",

We extend the Sequence-to-Sequence Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection framework to simultaneously detect multiple speakers' voice activities from audio-visual signals. The final system achieves a diarization error rate (DER) of 8.82% on the evaluation set of the competition database, which ranks 1st in the speaker diarization track of the MISP 2022, ICASSP Signal Processing Grand Challenge.",

      "abstract": "Despite the great performance of language identification (LID), there is a lack of large-scale singing LID databases to support the research of singing language identification (SLID). This paper proposed a over 3200 hours dataset used for singing language identification, called Slingua. As the baseline, we explore two self-supervised learning (SSL) models, WavLM and Wav2vec2, as the feature extractors for both SLID and universal singing speech language identification (ULID), compared with the traditional handcraft feature. Moreover, by training with speech language corpus, we compare the performance difference of the universal singing speech language identification. The final results show that the SSL-based features exhibit more robust generalization, especially for low-resource and open-set scenarios. The database can be downloaded following this repository: https://github.com/Doctor-Do/Slingua.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) filter for reference picture resampling (RPR)-based super-resolution (SR) with wavelet decomposition. The proposed CNN filter takes the low resolution (LR) reconstructed frame (Rec <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LR</inf> ), LR prediction frame (Pre <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LR</inf> ) and high resolution (HR) RPR upsampled frame (RPR <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">output</inf> ) as the input for RPR-based SR. Thus, the proposed CNN filter not only learns a mapping function between LR and HR images, but also effectively removes blocking artifacts in the reconstructed frame. We adopt wavelet decomposition to make RPR <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">output</inf> the same size as Rec <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LR</inf> and Pre <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LR</inf> as well as obtain the relationship between high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) components. To maximize feature reuse under the limited parameters, we design a residual spatial and channel attention block (RSCB) that combines residual blocks with spatial attention and channel attention to learn the weighted local information and global information in different receptive fields. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN filter achieves -8.98% and -4.05% BD-rate reductions on Y channel in AI and RA configurations over VTM-11.0_NNVC-2.0 anchor, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Since clicks usually contain heavy noise, increasing research efforts have been devoted to modeling implicit negative user behaviors (i.e., non-clicks). However, they either rely on explicit negative user behaviors (e.g., dislikes) or simply treat non-clicks as negative feedback, failing to learn negative user interests comprehensively. In such situations, users may experience fatigue because of seeing too many similar recommendations. In this paper, we propose Fatigue-Aware Network (FAN), a novel CTR model that directly perceives user fatigue from non-clicks. Specifically, we first apply Fourier Transformation to the time series generated from non-clicks, obtaining its frequency spectrum which contains comprehensive information about user fatigue. Then the frequency spectrum is modulated by category information of the target item to model the bias that both the upper bound of fatigue and users' patience is different for different categories. Moreover, a gating network is adopted to model the confidence of user fatigue and an auxiliary task is designed to guide the learning of user fatigue, so we can obtain a well-learned fatigue representation and combine it with user interests for the final CTR prediction. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the superiority of FAN and online A/B tests also show FAN outperforms representative CTR models significantly.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we establish a physical access control mechanism for vehicular platoons. The goal is to restrict vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to platooning members by tying the digital identity of a candidate vehicle requesting to join a platoon to its physical trajectory relative to the platoon. We propose the Wiggle protocol that employs a physical challenge-response exchange to prove that a candidate requesting to be admitted into a platoon actually follows it. The protocol name is inspired by the random longitudinal movements that the candidate is challenged to execute. Wiggle prevents any remote adversary from joining the platoon and injecting fake V2V messages. Compared to prior works, Wiggle is resistant to prerecording attacks and can verify that the candidate is traveling behind the verifier in the same lane.",

      "abstract": "Background Reduced or absence of the response to name (RTN) has been widely reported as an early specific indicator for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while few studies have quantified the RTN of toddlers with ASD in an automatic way. The present study aims to apply a multimodal machine learning system (MMLS) in early screening for toddlers with ASD based on the RTN. Methods A total of 125 toddlers were recruited, including ASD ( n = 61), developmental delay (DD, n = 31), and typical developmental (TD, n = 33). Procedures of RTN were, respectively, performed by the evaluator and caregiver. Behavioral data were collected by eight-definition tripod-mounted cameras and coded by the MMLS. Response score, response time, and response duration time were accurately calculated to evaluate RTN. Results Total accuracy of RTN scores rated by computers was 0.92. In both evaluator and caregiver procedures, toddlers with ASD had significant differences in response score, response time, and response duration time, compared to toddlers with DD and TD (all P -values &amp;lt; 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.81 for the computer-rated results, and the AUC was 0.91 for the human-rated results. The accuracy in the identification of ASD based on the computer- and human-rated results was, respectively, 74.8 and 82.9%. There was a significant difference between the AUC of the human-rated results and computer-rated results ( Z = 2.71, P -value = 0.007). Conclusion The multimodal machine learning system can accurately quantify behaviors in RTN procedures and may effectively distinguish toddlers with ASD from the non-ASD group. This novel system may provide a low-cost approach to early screening and identifying toddlers with ASD. However, machine learning is not as accurate as a human observer, and the detection of a single symptom like RTN is not sufficient enough to detect ASD.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral observation plays an essential role in the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by analyzing children's atypical patterns in social activities (e.g., impaired social interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive behavior). To date, this process still heavily relies on the questionnaire survey, clinical observation, or retrospective video analysis, leading to high demand for professionals with massive labor costs. This article proposes a standardized platform for stimulating, gathering, analyzing, modeling, and interpreting human behavioral data in the application of computer-aided ASD diagnosis. By a structured assessment process, the proposed system can automatically evaluate children's multiple social interaction skills using the captured audio-visual data and provide the final diagnostic suggestions. We collect a multimodal behavioral database of 95 participants (71 children with ASD and 24 age-matched typical controls) in a real clinic environment, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, China. On the clinical database, our proposed computer-aided ASD diagnosis system obtains an accuracy of 88.42% for identifying ASD children with an average age of 24 months, representing a performance comparable to top-level human experts. As a unified and replicable solution, it has good potential to be promoted to less developed areas with limited high-quality medical resources.",

We derive a theory of human-like few-shot learning from von-Neuman-Landauer's principle. modelling human learning is difficult as how people learn varies from one to another. Under commonly accepted definitions, we prove that all human or animal few-shot learning, and major models including Free Energy Principle and Bayesian Program Learning that model such learning, approximate our theory, under Church-Turing thesis. We find that deep generative model like variational autoencoder (VAE) can be used to approximate our theory and perform significantly better than baseline models including deep neural networks, for image recognition, low resource language processing, and character recognition.",

      "abstract": "Because of the fast development in technologies, our lives have been constantly changing and the impact of changes on labor markets is essential for economic growth and inequality. This dissertation explores the relationship between economic growth, inequality, and the challenges in adapting to changes in the labor market. The study focuses on understanding the difficulties workers face when their skills need to change or when they need to switch to different industries. It examines how these adjustments affect productivity, wages, and the perception of technological changes that favor certain skills. Additionally, it explores the obstacles workers encounter when trying to move between different industries due to factors like high costs or specific skills needed in particular industries. The research also discusses the role of labor market policies in managing unemployment and inflation. It considers the trade-offs involved and the challenges of implementing effective policies. Overall, the dissertation highlights the importance of understanding and addressing these challenges to achieve both economic growth and a fairer society.",

      "abstract": "A reliable voice anti-spoofing countermeasure system needs to robustly protect automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems in various kinds of spoofing scenarios. However, the performance of countermeasure systems could be degraded by channel effects and codecs. In this paper, we show that using the low-frequency subbands of signals as input can mitigate the negative impact introduced by codecs on the countermeasure systems. To validate this, two types of low-pass filters with different cut-off frequencies are applied to countermeasure systems, and the equal error rate (EER) is reduced by up to 25% relatively. In addition, we propose a deep learning based bandwidth extension approach to further improve the detection accuracy. Recent studies show that the error rate of countermeasure systems increase dramatically when the silence part is removed by Voice Activity Detection (VAD), our experimental results show that the filtering and bandwidth extension approaches are also effective under the codec condition when VAD is applied.",

      "abstract": "Recent anti-spoofing systems focus on spoofing detection, where the task is only to determine whether the test audio is fake. However, there are few studies putting attention to identifying the methods of generating fake speech. Common spoofing attack algorithms in the logical access (LA) scenario, such as voice conversion and speech synthesis, can be divided into several stages: input processing, conversion, waveform generation, etc. In this work, we propose a system for classifying different spoofing attributes, representing characteristics of different modules in the whole pipeline. Classifying attributes for the spoofing attack other than determining the whole spoofing pipeline can make the system more robust when encountering complex combinations of different modules at different stages. In addition, our system can also be used as an auxiliary system for anti-spoofing against unseen spoofing methods. The experiments are conducted on ASVspoof 2019 LA data set and the proposed method achieved a 20% relative improvement against conventional binary spoof detection methods.",

      "abstract": "Complex feature extractors are widely employed for text representation building. However, these complex feature extractors make the NLP systems prone to overfitting especially when the downstream training datasets are relatively small, which is the case for several discourse parsing tasks. Thus, we propose an alternative lightweight neural architecture that removes multiple complex feature extractors and only utilizes learnable self-attention modules to indirectly exploit pretrained neural language models, in order to maximally preserve the generalizability of pre-trained language models. Experiments on three common discourse parsing tasks show that powered by recent pretrained language models, the lightweight architecture consisting of only two self-attention layers obtains much better generalizability and robustness. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable or even better system performance with fewer learnable parameters and less processing time.",

      "abstract": "This paper is the system description of the DKU-Tencent System for the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2022 (VoxSRC22). In this challenge, we focus on track1 and track3. For track1, multiple backbone networks are adopted to extract frame-level features. Since track1 focus on the cross-age scenarios, we adopt the cross-age trials and perform QMF to calibrate score. The magnitude-based quality measures achieve a large improvement. For track3, the semi-supervised domain adaptation task, the pseudo label method is adopted to make domain adaptation. Considering the noise labels in clustering, the ArcFace is replaced by Sub-center ArcFace. The final submission achieves 0.107 mDCF in task1 and 7.135% EER in task3.",

      "abstract": "The popularity and application of smart home devices have made far-field speaker verification an urgent need. However, speaker verification performance is unsatisfactory under far-field environments despite its significant improvements enabled by deep neural networks (DNN). In this paper, we summarize our previous work and propose multiple training strategies and models for multi-channel far-field speaker verification with different in-domain data availability scenarios. The experiments are conducted on the FFSVC20 dataset, and we proposed the cross-device and cross-domain trials. We focus on single-channel and multi-channel speaker verification training based on the dataset. For single-channel speaker verification, considering the size of training data and availability of labels, we introduce three training scenarios and given our proposed training methods, including 1) given zero out-of-domain data and few in-domain labeled data; 2) given large-scale out-of-domain labeled data and few in-domain labeled data; 3) given large-scale out-of-domain labeled data and few in-domain unlabeled data. To this end, we propose a meta-learning approach, refined transfer learning methods, and semi-supervised learning for three scenarios, respectively. For multi-channel speaker verification, we first introduce two types of 3 dimension convolution (3D Conv) residual network (ResNet) models proposed in our previous works, including fully 3D ResNet and incorporating 3D Conv with 2D Conv ResNet (3D2D-ResNet). In this paper, we propose channel-wise 3D squeeze-and-excitation ResNet (C3DSE-ResNet) and spatial-wise 3D SE ResNet (S3DSE-ResNet) to further explore the channel dependencies and improve the 3D ConvNet performance. The results show that the proposed strategies and models can significantly boost performance under the far-field scenario.",

      "abstract": "This paper discribes the DKU-DukeECE submission to the 4th track of the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2022 (VoxSRC-22). Our system contains a fused voice activity detection model, a clustering-based diarization model, and a target-speaker voice activity detection-based overlap detection model. Overall, the submitted system is similar to our previous year's system in VoxSRC-21. The difference is that we use a much better speaker embedding and a fused voice activity detection, which significantly improves the performance. Finally, we fuse 4 different systems using DOVER-lap and achieve 4.75 of the diarization error rate, which ranks the 1st place in track 4.",

      "abstract": "Audio deep synthesis techniques have been able to generate high-quality speech whose authenticity is difficult for humans to recognize. Meanwhile, many anti-spoofing systems have been developed to capture artifacts in the synthesized speech that are imperceptible to human hearing, thus a continuous escalating race of 'attacking and defending' in voice deepfake has started. Hence, to further improve the probability of successfully cheating anti-spoofing systems, we propose a fully end-to-end, any-to-many voice conversion method based on a non-autoregressive structure with the addition of two light but strong post-processing strategies namely silence replacement and global noise perturbation. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than current baselines in fooling several state-of-the-art anti-spoofing systems. Better naturalness and speaker similarity are also achieved, resulting in our proposed method showing high deception performance against humans.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes the deepfake audio detection system submitted to the Audio Deep Synthesis Detection (ADD) Challenge Track 3.2 and gives an analysis of score fusion. The proposed system is a score-level fusion of several light convolutional neural network (LCNN) based models. Various front-ends are used as input features, including low-frequency short-time Fourier transform and Constant Q transform. Due to the complex noise and rich synthesis algorithms, it is difficult to obtain the desired performance using the training set directly. Online data augmentation methods effectively improve the robustness of fake audio detection systems. In particular, the reasons for the poor improvement of score fusion are explored through visualization of the score distributions and comparison with score distribution on another dataset. The overfitting of the model to the training set leads to extreme values of the scores and low correlation of the score distributions, which makes score fusion difficult. Fusion with partially fake audio detection system improves system performance further. The submission on track 3.2 obtained the weighted equal error rate (WEER) of 11.04\\%, which is one of the best performing systems in the challenge.",

      "abstract": "Estimating gaze from a low-resolution (LR) facial image is a challenging task. Most current networks for gaze estimation focus on using face images of adequate resolution. Their performance degrades when the image resolution decreases due to information loss. This work aims to explore more helpful face and gaze information in a novel way to alleviate the problem of information loss in the LR gaze estimation task. Considering that all faces have a relatively fixed structure, it is feasible to reconstruct the residual information of face and gaze based on the solid constraint of the prior knowledge of face structure through learning an end-to-end mapping from pairs of low- and high-resolution (HR) images. This article proposes a complementary dual-branch network (CDBN) to achieve this task. A fundamental branch is designed to extract features of the major structural information from LR input. A residual branch is employed to reconstruct features containing the residual information as a supplement under the supervision of both the HR image and gaze direction. These two features are then fused and processed for gaze estimation. Experimental results on three widely used data sets, MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, and RT-GENE, show that the proposed CDBN achieves more accurate gaze estimation from the LR input image compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Automatic speaker verification has achieved remarkable progress in recent years.However, there is little research on cross-age speaker verification (CASV) due to insufficient relevant data.In this paper, we mine cross-age test sets based on the VoxCeleb dataset and propose our age-invariant speaker representation(AISR) learning method.Since the VoxCeleb is collected from the YouTube platform, the dataset consists of crossage data inherently.However, the meta-data does not contain the speaker age label.Therefore, we adopt the face age estimation method to predict the speaker age value from the associated visual data, then label the audio recording with the estimated age.We construct multiple Cross-Age test sets on VoxCeleb (Vox-CA), which deliberately select the positive trials with large age-gap.Also, the effect of nationality and gender is considered in selecting negative pairs to align with Vox-H cases.The baseline system performance drops from 1.939% EER on the Vox-H test set to 10.419% on the Vox-CA20 test set, which indicates how difficult the cross-age scenario is.Consequently, we propose an age-decoupling adversarial learning (ADAL) method to alleviate the negative effect of the age gap and reduce intra-class variance.Our method outperforms the baseline system by over 10% related EER reduction on the Vox-CA20 test set.The source code and trial resources are available on https://github.com/qinxiaoyi/Cross-AgeSpeaker Verification.",

      "abstract": "In the post-pandemic era, online courses have been adopted universally. Manually assessing online course teaching quality requires significant time and professional pedagogy experience. To address this problem, we design an evaluation protocol and propose a multimodal machine learning framework <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> for automated teaching quality assessment of one-to-many online instruction videos. Our framework evaluates online teaching quality from five aspects, namely Clarity, Classroom interaction, Technical management of online teaching, Empathy, and Time management. Our method includes mid-level behavior feature extraction, high-level interpretable feature extraction, and supervised learning prediction. Our automated multimodal teaching quality assessment system achieves comparable performance to human annotators on our one-to-many online instruction videos. For binary classification, the best average accuracy of five aspects is 0.898. For regression, the best average means square error is 0.527 on a 0-10 scale.",

We propose a multiple-target speech separation model (MTSS) to simultaneously extract each speaker's voice from the mixed speech rather than just optimally estimating the target source. Moreover, we propose a speaker diarization (SD) aware MTSS system (SD-MTSS), which consists of a SD module and MTSS module. By exploiting the TSVAD decision and the estimated mask, our SD-MTSS model can extract the speech signal of each speaker concurrently in a conversational recording without additional enrollment audio in advance. Experimental results show that our MTSS model achieves 1.38dB SDR, 1.34dB SI-SDR, and 0.13 PESQ improvements over the baseline on the WSJ0-2mix-extr dataset, respectively. The SD-MTSS system makes 19.2% relative speaker dependent character error rate (CER) reduction on the Alimeeting dataset.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, as more and more systems achieve good performance in traditional voice conversion (VC) tasks, people's attention gradually turns to VC tasks under extreme conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for zero-shot voice conversion. We aim to obtain intermediate representations for speaker-content disentanglement of speech to better remove speaker information and get pure content information. Accordingly, our proposed framework contains a module that removes the speaker information from the acoustic feature of the source speaker. Moreover, speaker information control is added to our system to maintain the voice cloning performance. The proposed system is evaluated by subjective and objective metrics. Results show that our proposed system significantly reduces the trade-off problem in zero-shot voice conversion, while it also manages to have high spoofing power to the speaker verification system.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the attention mechanism such as squeeze-and-excitation module (SE) and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) has achieved great success in deep learning-based speaker verification system. This paper introduces an alternative effective yet simple one, i.e., simple attention module (SimAM), for speaker verification. The SimAM module is a plug-and-play module without extra modal parameters. In addition, we propose a noisy label detection method to iteratively filter out the data samples with a noisy label from the training data, considering that a large-scale dataset labeled with human annotation or other automated processes may contain noisy labels. Data with the noisy label may over parameterize a deep neural network (DNN) and result in a performance drop due to the memorization effect of the DNN. Experiments are conducted on VoxCeleb dataset. The speaker verification model with SimAM achieves the 0.675% equal error rate (EER) on VoxCeleb1 original test trials. Our proposed iterative noisy label detection method further reduces the EER to 0.643%.",

      "abstract": "DukeECE. As the highly overlapped speech exists in the dataset, we employ an x-vector-based target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) to find the overlap between speakers. Firstly, we separately train a single-channel model for each of the 8 channels and fuse the results. In addition, we also employ the cross-channel self-attention to further improve the performance, where the non-linear spatial correlations between different channels are learned and fused. Experimental results on the evaluation set show that the single-channel TS-VAD reduces the DER by over 75% from 12.68% to 3.14%. The multi-channel TS-VAD further reduces the DER by 28% and achieves a DER of 2.26%. Our final submitted system achieves a DER of 2.98% on the AliMeeting test set, which ranks 1st in the M2MET challenge. In this challenge, our team is denoted as A41.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes the system developed by the DKU team for the MISP Challenge 2021. We present a two-stage approach consisting of end-to-end neural networks for the audio-visual wake word spotting task. We first process audio and video data to give them a similar structure and then train two unimodal models with unified network architecture separately. Second, we propose a Hierarchical Modality Aggregation (HMA) module that fuses multi-scale audio-visual information from pre-trained unimodal models. Our system has a clear and concise framework consisting of end-to-end neural networks. With this framework and extensive data augmentation methods, our presented system achieves a false reject rate of 3.85% and a false alarm rate of 3.42% on far-field audio in the development set of the competition database, which ranks 2nd in the wake word spotting track of the MISP challenge.",

First, a ResNet-based network extracts the frame-level speaker embeddings from the acoustic features. Then, the L2-normalized frame-level speaker embeddings are fed to the transformer encoder which produces the initialization of the speaker diarization results. Later, the frame-level speaker embeddings are aggregated to several target-speaker embeddings based on the output from the transformer encoder. Finally, a BiLSTM-based TS-VAD model predicts the refined diarization results. Several aggregation methods are explored, including soft/hard decisions with/without normalization. Results show that E2E-TS-VAD achieves better performance than the original TS-VAD method with the clustering-based initialization.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Humans can recognize someone’s identity through their voice and describe the timbral phenomena of voices. Likewise, the singing voice also has timbral phenomena. In vocal pedagogy, vocal teachers listen and then describe the timbral phenomena of their student’s singing voice. In this study, in order to enable machines to describe the singing voice from the vocal pedagogy point of view, we perform a task called paralinguistic singing attribute recognition. To achieve this goal, we first construct and publish an open source dataset named Singing Voice Quality and Technique Database (SVQTD) for supervised learning. All the audio clips in SVQTD are downloaded from YouTube and processed by music source separation and silence detection. For annotation, seven paralinguistic singing attributes commonly used in vocal pedagogy are adopted as the labels. Furthermore, to explore the different supervised machine learning algorithm for classifying each paralinguistic singing attribute, we adopt three main frameworks, namely openSMILE features with support vector machine (SF-SVM), end-to-end deep learning (E2EDL), and deep embedding with support vector machine (DE-SVM). Our methods are based on existing frameworks commonly employed in other paralinguistic speech attribute recognition tasks. In SF-SVM, we separately use the feature set of the INTERSPEECH 2009 Challenge and that of the INTERSPEECH 2016 Challenge as the SVM classifier’s input. In E2EDL, the end-to-end framework separately utilizes the ResNet and transformer encoder as feature extractors. In particular, to handle two-dimensional spectrogram input for a transformer, we adopt a sliced multi-head self-attention (SMSA) mechanism. In the DE-SVM, we use the representation extracted from the E2EDL model as the input of the SVM classifier. Experimental results on SVQTD show no absolute winner between E2EDL and the DE-SVM, which means that the back-end SVM classifier with the representation learned by E2E as input does not necessarily improve the performance. However, the DE-SVM that utilizes the ResNet as the feature extractor achieves the best average UAR, with an average 16% improvement over that of the SF-SVM with INTERSPEECH’s hand-crafted feature set.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the speaker diarization system for the Multi-channel Multi-party Meeting Transcription Challenge (M2MeT) from team DKU_DukeECE. As the highly overlapped speech exists in the dataset, we employ an x-vector-based target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) to find the overlap between speakers. For the single-channel scenario, we separately train a model for each of the 8 channels and fuse the results. We also employ the cross-channel self-attention to further improve the performance, where the non-linear spatial correlations between different channels are learned and fused. Experimental results on the evaluation set show that the single-channel TS-VAD reduces the DER by over 75% from 12.68\\% to 3.14%. The multi-channel TS-VAD further reduces the DER by 28% and achieves a DER of 2.26%. Our final submitted system achieves a DER of 2.98% on the AliMeeting test set, which ranks 1st in the M2MET challenge.",

      "abstract": "The voice conversion task is to modify the speaker identity of continuous speech while preserving the linguistic content. Generally, the naturalness and similarity are two main metrics for evaluating the conversion quality, which has been improved significantly in recent years. This paper presents the HCCL-DKU entry for the fake audio generation task of the 2022 ICASSP ADD challenge. We propose a novel ppg-based voice conversion model that adopts a fully end-to-end structure. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other conversion models, including Tacotron-based and Fastspeech-based models, on conversion quality and spoofing performance against anti-spoofing systems. In addition, we investigate several post-processing methods for better spoofing power. Finally, we achieve second place with a deception success rate of 0.916 in the ADD challenge.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an invertible deep learning framework called INVVC for voice conversion. It is designed against the possible threats that inherently come along with voice conversion systems. Specifically, we develop an invertible framework that makes the source identity traceable. The framework is built on a series of invertible $1\\times1$ convolutions and flows consisting of affine coupling layers. We apply the proposed framework to one-to-one voice conversion and many-to-one conversion using parallel training data. Experimental results show that this approach yields impressive performance on voice conversion and, moreover, the converted results can be reversed back to the source inputs utilizing the same parameters as in forwarding.",

      "abstract": "Head pose estimation is an important step for many human-computer interaction applications such as face detection, facial recognition, and facial expression classification. Accurate head pose estimation benefits these applications that require face images as the input. Most head pose estimation methods suffer from perspective distortion because the users do not always align their face perfectly with the camera. This paper presents a new approach that uses image rectification to reduce the negative effect of perspective distortion and a lightweight convolutional neural network to obtain highly accurate head pose estimations. The proposed method calculates the angle between the optical axis of the camera and the projection vector of the center of the face. The face image is rectified using this estimated angle through perspective transformation. A lightweight network that is only 0.88 MB in size is designed to take the rectified face image as the input to perform head pose estimation. The output of the network, the head pose estimation of the rectified face image, is transformed back to the camera coordinate system as the final head pose estimation. Experiments on public benchmark datasets show that the proposed image rectification method and the newly designed lightweight network improve the accuracy of head pose estimation remarkably. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves both higher accuracy and faster processing speed.",

Self-supervised learning thus attracts many research interests to train models without labels. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for speaker recognition. Combining clustering with deep representation learning, the proposed framework generates pseudo labels for the unlabeled dataset and learns speaker representation without human annotation. Our method starts with training a speaker representation encoder with contrastive self-supervised learning. Clustering on the learned representation generates pseudo labels, which are used as the supervisory signal for the subsequent training of the representation encoder. The clustering and representation learning process is performed iteratively to bootstrap the discriminative power of the deep neural network. We apply this self-supervised learning framework to both single modal audio data and multi-modal audio-visual data. For audio-visual data, audio and visual representation encoders are employed to learn representations of the corresponding modality. A cluster ensemble algorithm is then used to fuse the clustering results of the two modalities. The complementary information in multi-modalities ensures a robust and fault-tolerant supervisory signal for audio and visual representation learning. Experimental results show that our proposed iterative self-supervised learning framework outperforms previous works with self-supervision by large margins. Training with single modal audio data on the development set of VoxCeleb 2, our proposed framework achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 2.8% on the original test trials of VoxCeleb 1. When training with additional visual modality, the EER further reduces to 1.8%, which is only 20% higher than the fully supervised audio-based system with an EER of 1.5%. Also, experimental analysis shows that the proposed framework generates pseudolabels that are highly correlated to ground truth labels.",

Moreover, we propose the segmental pooling strategy and jointly train the speaker embedding network along with the similarity measurement model. Later, this joint training framework is further extended to the target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD), with only slight modification in the network architecture. Experimental results of the DIHARD II, DIHARD III and VoxConverse datasets show that our clustering-based system with the neural similarity measurement achieves superior performance to recent approaches on all three datasets. In addition, the segment-level TS-VAD method further improves the clustering-based results and achieves DER of 16.48&#x0025;, 11.62&#x0025; and 4.39&#x0025; on the DIHARD II, DIHARD III and VoxConverse datasets, respectively.",

      "abstract": "With emerging vision-based autonomous driving (AD) systems, it becomes increasingly important to have datasets to evaluate their correct operation and identify potential security flaws.However, when collecting a large amount of data, either human experts manually label potentially hundreds of thousands of image frames or systems use machine learning algorithms to label the data, with the hope that the accuracy is good enough for the application.This can become especially problematic when tracking the context information, such as the location and velocity of surrounding objects, useful to evaluate the correctness and improve stability and robustness of the AD systems.In this paper, we introduce DRIVETRUTH, a data collection framework built on CARLA, an open-source simulator for AD research, which constructs datasets with automatically generated accurate object labels, bounding boxes of objects and their contextual information through accessing simulation state and using semantic LiDAR raycasts.By leveraging the actual state of the simulation and the agents within it, we guarantee complete accuracy in all labels and gathered contextual information.Further, the use of the simulator provides easily collecting data in diverse environmental conditions and agent behaviors, with lighting, weather, and traffic behavior being configurable within the simulation.Through this effort, we provide users a means to extracting actionable simulated data from CARLA to test and explore attacks and defenses for AD systems.",

      "abstract": "Wake-up word detection models are widely used in real life, but suffer from severe performance degradation when encountering adversarial samples. In this paper we discuss the concept of confusing words in adversarial samples. Confusing words are commonly encountered, which are various kinds of words that sound similar to the predefined keywords. To enhance the wake word detection system's robustness against confusing words, we propose several methods to generate the adversarial confusing samples for simulating real confusing words scenarios in which we usually do not have any real confusing samples in the training set. The generated samples include concatenated audio, synthesized data, and partially masked keywords. Moreover, we use a domain embedding concatenated system to improve the performance. Experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated in our approach help improve the system's robustness in both the common scenario and the confusing words scenario. In addition, we release the confusing words testing database called HI-MIA-CW for future research.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces an online speaker diarization system that can handle long-time audio with low latency. First, a new variant of agglomerative hierarchy clustering is built to cluster the speakers in an online fashion. Then, a speaker embedding graph is proposed. We use this graph to exploit a graph-based reclustering method to further improve the performance. Finally, a label matching algorithm is introduced to generate consistent speaker labels, and we evaluate our system on both DIHARD3 and VoxConverse datasets, which contain long audios with various kinds of scenarios. The experimental results show that our online diarization system outperforms the baseline offline system and has comparable performance to our offline system.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the safety of passengers within the enclosed public space, such as the elevator, becomes more and more important. Though the passengers can click the \"SOS\" button to call the remote safety guard, the chances are that some passengers might lose their ability to stand up to click the button or it is not convenient to do so when in emergency situations. Also, people's first reaction may be to call for help using voice instead of pressing the mayday button. Thus, we believe a speech-based system is very useful under this scenario. This work proposes a system using keyword spotting and paralinguistic analysis to detect whether the passenger calls for help in mandarin and gives real-time feedback which might provide the passenger within time help to prevent the accident. Unlike the standard keyword spotting task which is to detect the pre-defined call for help keyword \"jiu ming\" in any scenario, we focus on detecting both the keyword and the paralinguistic states. The system will only be triggered when the keyword and the emergency situation such as shouting or screaming appear at the same time. To this end, we compare the performance of different methods and we find that the deep neural network-based small-footprint keyword spotting methods are effective and efficient for keyword spotting tasks under emotional scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Videos grow to be one of the largest mediums on the Internet. E-commerce platforms like Alibaba need to process millions of video data across multimedia (e.g., visual, audio, image, and text) and on a variety of tasks (e.g., retrieval, tagging, and summary) every day. In this work, we aim to develop a once and for all pretraining technique for diverse modalities and downstream tasks. To achieve this, we make the following contributions: (1) We propose a self-supervised multi-modal co-training framework. It takes cross-modal pseudo-label consistency as the supervision and can jointly learn representations of multiple modalities. (2) We introduce several novel techniques (e.g., sliding-window subset sampling, coarse-to-fine clustering, fast spatial-temporal convolution and parallel data transmission and processing) to optimize the training process, making billion-scale stable training feasible. (3) We construct a large-scale multi-modal dataset consisting of 1.4 billion videos (~0.5 PB) and train our framework on it. The training takes only 4.6 days on an in-house 256 GPUs cluster, and it simultaneously produces pretrained video, audio, image, motion, and text networks. (4) Finetuning from our pretrained models, we obtain significant performance gains and faster convergence on diverse multimedia tasks at Alibaba. Furthermore, we also validate the learned representation on public datasets. Despite the domain gap between our commodity-centric pretraining and the action-centric evaluation data, we show superior results against state-of-the-arts.",

Moreover, we present a novel framework (RGBP) to utilize multimodal data to enhance unimodal test performance for the task of abnormal event recognition in elevators. Experimental results show that the best network architecture with the RGBP framework effectively improves the unimodal inference performance on the Elevator RGBD dataset by 4.71% (accuracy) and 4.95% (F1 score) with respect to the pure RGB model. In addition, our RGBP framework outperforms two other methods for \"multimodal training and unimodal inference\": MTUT [1] and the two-stage method based on depth estimation.",

      "abstract": "With the development of deep learning, automatic speaker verification has made considerable progress over the past few years. However, to design a lightweight and robust system with limited computational resources is still a challenging problem. Traditionally, a speaker verification system is symmetrical, indicating that the same embedding extraction model is applied for both enrollment and verification in inference. In this paper, we come up with an innovative asymmetric structure, which takes the large-scale ECAPA-TDNN model for enrollment and the small-scale ECAPA-TDNNLite model for verification. As a symmetrical system, our proposed ECAPA-TDNNLite model achieves an EER of 3.07% on the Voxceleb1 original test set with only 11.6M FLOPS. Moreover, the asymmetric structure further reduces the EER to 2.31%, without increasing any computational costs during verification.",

Our method employs an iterative labeling framework to learn self-supervised speaker representation based on a deep neural network (DNN). The framework starts with training a self-supervision speaker embedding network by maximizing agreement between different segments within an utterance via a contrastive loss. Taking advantage of DNN's ability to learn from data with label noise, we propose to cluster the speaker embedding obtained from the previous speaker network and use the subsequent class assignments as pseudo labels to train a new DNN. Moreover, we iteratively train the speaker network with pseudo labels generated from the previous step to bootstrap the discriminative power of a DNN. Also, visual modal data is incorporated in this self-labeling framework. The visual pseudo label and the audio pseudo label are fused with a cluster ensemble algorithm to generate a robust supervisory signal for representation learning. Our submission achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 5.58% and 5.59% on the challenge development and test set, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Although deep neural networks are successful for many tasks in the speech domain, the high computational and memory costs of deep neural networks make it difficult to directly deploy highperformance Neural Network systems on low-resource embedded devices. There are several mechanisms to reduce the size of the neural networks i.e. parameter pruning, parameter quantization, etc. This paper focuses on how to apply binary neural networks to the task of speaker verification. The proposed binarization of training parameters can largely maintain the performance while significantly reducing storage space requirements and computational costs. Experiment results show that, after binarizing the Convolutional Neural Network, the ResNet34-based network achieves an EER of around 5% on the Voxceleb1 testing dataset and even outperforms the traditional real number network on the text-dependent dataset: Xiaole while having a 32x memory saving.",

      "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) accuracy is often affected by an individual's unique facial characteristics. Recognition performance can be improved if the influence from these physical characteristics is minimized. Using video instead of single image for FER provides better results but requires extracting temporal features and the spatial structure of facial expressions in an integrated manner. We propose a new network called Typical Facial Expression Network (TFEN) to address both challenges. TFEN uses two deep two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract facial and expression features from input video. A facial feature decoupler decouples facial features from expression features to minimize the influence from inter-subject face variations. These networks combine with a 3D CNN and form a spatial-temporal learning network to jointly explore the spatial-temporal features in a video. A facial recognition network works as an adversarial network to refine the facial feature decoupler and the network performance by minimizing the residual influence of facial features after decoupling. The whole network is trained with an adversarial algorithm to improve FER performance. TFEN was evaluated on four popular dynamic FER datasets. Experimental results show TFEN achieves or outperforms the recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative vehicle platooning significantly improves highway safety and fuel efficiency. In this model, a set of vehicles move in line formation and coordinate functions such as acceleration, braking, and steering using a combination of physical sensing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messaging. The authenticity and integrity of the V2V messages are paramount to highway safety. For this reason, recent V2V and V2X standards support the integration of a PKI. However, a PKI cannot bind a vehicle's digital identity to the vehicle's physical state (location, heading, velocity, etc.). As a result, a vehicle with valid cryptographic credentials can impact the platoon by creating ghost vehicles and injecting false state information. In this paper, we seek to provide the missing link between the physical and the digital world in the context of verifying a vehicle's platoon membership. We focus on the property of following, where vehicles follow each other in a close and coordinated manner. We aim at developing a Proof-of-Following (PoF) protocol that enables a candidate vehicle to prove that it follows a verifier within the typical platooning distance. The main idea of the proposed PoF protocol is to draw security from the common, but constantly changing environment experienced by the closely traveling vehicles. We use the large-scale fading effect of ambient RF signals as a common source of randomness to construct a PoF primitive. The correlation of large-scale fading is an ideal candidate for the mobile outdoor environment because it exponentially decays with distance and time. We evaluate our PoF protocol on an experimental platoon of two vehicles in freeway, highway, and urban driving conditions. In such realistic conditions, we demonstrate that the PoF withstands both the pre-recording and following attacks with overwhelming probability.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative vehicle platooning significantly improves highway safety, fuel efficiency, and traffic flow. In this model, a set of vehicles move in line formation and coordinate acceleration, braking, and steering using a combination of physical sensing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messaging. The authenticity and integrity of the V2V messages are paramount to safety. For this reason, recent V2V and V2X standards support the integration of a PKI. However, a PKI cannot bind a vehicle's digital identity to the vehicle's physical state (location, velocity, etc.). As a result, a vehicle with valid cryptographic credentials can impact platoons from a remote location. In this paper, we seek to provide the missing link between the physical and the digital world in the context of vehicle platooning. We propose a new access control protocol we call Proof-of-Following (PoF) that verifies the following distance between a candidate and a verifier. The main idea is to draw security from the common, but constantly changing environment experienced by the closely traveling vehicles. We use the large-scale fading effect of ambient RF signals as a common source of randomness to construct a {\\em PoF} primitive. The correlation of large-scale fading is an ideal candidate for the mobile outdoor environment because it exponentially decays with distance and time. We evaluate our PoF protocol on an experimental platoon of two vehicles in freeway, highway, and urban driving conditions. We demonstrate that the PoF withstands both the pre-recording and following attacks with overwhelming probability.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a strong need to deploy the target speaker separation (TSS) model on mobile devices with a limitation of the model size and computational complexity. To better perform TSS for mobile voice communication, we first make a dual-channel dataset based on a specific scenario, LibriPhone. Specifically, to better mimic the real-case scenario, instead of simulating from the single-channel dataset, LibriPhone is made by simultaneously replaying pairs of utterances from LibriSpeech by two professional artificial heads and recording by two built-in microphones of the mobile. Then, we propose a lightweight time-frequency domain separation model, LSTM-Former, which is based on the LSTM framework with source-to-noise ratio (SI-SNR) loss. For the experiments on Libri-Phone, we explore the dual-channel LSTMFormer model and a single-channel version by a random single channel of Libri-Phone. Experimental result shows that the dual-channel LSTM-Former outperforms the single-channel LSTMFormer with relative 25% improvement. This work provides a feasible solution for the TSS task on mobile devices, playing back and recording multiple data sources in real application scenarios for getting dual-channel real data can assist the lightweight model to achieve higher performance.",

Firstly, a high-resolution dictionary was built for each number on license plate. Secondly, the dictionary was applied to each blurry number image respectively to fill in the missing feature information. Then, the images with features filled were input into the neural network to perform the feature extraction, pixel shuffle and other operations. After that, the final super-resolved image was obtained. Experimental results showed that proposed algorithm outperformed existing super-resolution algorithms like Bicubic, SRCNN, SRGAN and VDSR as applied to blurry license plate images, and greatly improved the recognition rate.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an iterative framework for self-supervised speaker representation learning based on a deep neural network (DNN). The framework starts with training a self-supervision speaker embedding network by maximizing agreement between different segments within an utterance via a contrastive loss. Taking advantage of DNN's ability to learn from data with label noise, we propose to cluster the speaker embedding obtained from the previous speaker network and use the subsequent class assignments as pseudo labels to train a new DNN. Moreover, we iteratively train the speaker network with pseudo labels generated from the previous step to bootstrap the discriminative power of a DNN. Speaker verification experiments are conducted on the VoxCeleb dataset. The results show that our proposed iterative self-supervised learning framework outperformed previous works using self-supervision. The speaker network after 5 iterations obtains a 61% performance gain over the speaker embedding model trained with contrastive loss.",

This paper describes a parallel non-autoregressive network to achieve bilingual and code-switched voice conversion for multiple speakers when there are only mono-lingual corpora for each language. We achieve cross-lingual VC between Mandarin speech with multiple speakers and English speech with multiple speakers by applying bilingual bottleneck features. To boost voice cloning performance, we use an adversarial speaker classifier with a gradient reversal layer to reduce the source speaker's information from the output of encoder. Furthermore, in order to improve speaker similarity between reference speech and converted speech, we adopt an embedding consistency loss between the synthesized speech and its natural reference speech in our network. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve high quality converted speech with mean opinion score (MOS) around 4. The conversion system performs well in terms of speaker similarity for both in-set speaker conversion and out-set-of one-shot conversion.",

Both spectrograms and context segment features are used to train the tone classifier. We first divide the spectrogram frames into syllable segments using force alignment results produced by an ASR model. Then we extract the short-term segment features to capture the context information across multiple syllables. Feeding both the spectrogram and the short-term context segment features into an end-to-end model could significantly improve the performance. Experiments are performed on a large-scale open-source Mandarin speech dataset to evaluate the proposed method. Results show that this method improves the classification accuracy from 79.5% to 92.6% on the AISHELL3 database.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the system submitted by the DKU-SMIIP team for the Auto-KWS 2021 Challenge. Our implementation consists of a two-stage keyword spotting system based on query-by-example spoken term detection and a speaker verification system. We employ two different detection algorithms in our proposed keyword spotting system. The first stage adopts subsequence dynamic time warping for template matching based on frame-level language-independent bottleneck feature and phoneme posterior probability. We use a sliding window template matching algorithm based on acoustic word embeddings to further verify the detection from the first stage. As a result, our KWS system achieves an average score of 0.61 on the feedback dataset, which outperforms the baseline1 system by 0.25.",

Different from previous configurations, we combine audio data in two languages for training instead of only using one single language. We trans-form the acoustic features of keyword templates and searching content segments obtained in a sliding manner to fixed-dimensional vectors and calculate the distances between them. An auxiliary variability-invariant loss is also applied to training data within the same word but different speakers. This strategy is used to prevent the extractor from encoding undesired speaker- or accent-related information into the acoustic word embeddings. Experimental results show that our proposed sys-tem produces promising searching results in the code-switching test scenario. With the employment of variability-invariant loss, the searching performance is further enhanced.",

It enables spectral feature interactions with multi-head attention mechanism, achieves easier parallel computing and has a larger receptive field com-pared with LSTMs and CNNs respectively. Experimental results on the MUSDB18 dataset show that the proposed method, with fewer parameters, outperforms most of the state-of-the-art DNN-based methods.",

This study aims at improving the performance of far-field speaker verification systems with distributed microphone arrays in the smart home scenario. The proposed learning framework consists of two modules: a deep speaker embedding module and an aggregation module. The former extracts a speaker embedding for each recording. The latter, based on either averaged pooling or attentive pooling, aggregates speaker embeddings and learns a unified representation for all recordings captured by distributed microphone arrays. The two modules are trained in an end-to-end manner. To evaluate this framework, we conduct experiments on the real text-dependent far-field datasets Hi Mia. Results show that our framework outperforms the naive averaged aggregation methods by 20% in terms of equal error rate (EER) with six distributed microphone arrays. Also, we find that the attention-based aggregation advocates high-quality recordings and repels low-quality ones.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder, which causes deficits in social lives. Early screening of ASD for young children is important to reduce the impact of ASD on people's lives. Traditional screening methods mainly rely on protocol-based interviews and subjective evaluations from clinicians and domain experts, which requires advanced expertise and intensive labor. To standardize the process of ASD screening, we design a \"Responsive Social Smile\" protocol and the associated experimental setup. Moreover, we propose a machine learning based assessment framework for early ASD screening. By integrating speech recognition and computer vision technologies, the proposed framework can quantitatively analyze children's behaviors under well-designed protocols. We collect 196 stimulus samples from 41 children with an average age of 23.34 months, and the proposed method obtains 85.20% accuracy for predicting stimulus scores and 80.49% accuracy for the final ASD prediction. This result indicates that our model approaches the average level of domain experts in this \"Responsive Social Smile\" protocol.",

      "abstract": "The 2020 Personalized Voice Trigger Challenge (PVTC2020) addresses two different research problems a unified setup: joint wake-up word detection with speaker verification on close-talking single microphone data and far-field multi-channel microphone array data. Specially, the second task poses an additional cross-channel matching challenge on top of the far-field condition. To simulate the real-life application scenario, the enrollment utterances are recorded from close-talking cell-phone only, while the test utterances are recorded from both the close-talking cell-phone and the far-field microphone arrays. This paper introduces our challenge setup and the released database as well as the evaluation metrics. In addition, we present a joint end-to-end neural network baseline system trained with the proposed database for speaker-dependent wake-up word detection. Results show that the cost calculated from the miss rate and the false alarm rate, can reach 0.37 in the close-talking single microphone task and 0.31 in the far-field microphone array task. The official website and the open-source baseline system have been released.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose two different audio-based piano performance evaluation systems for beginners. The first is a sequential and modularized system, including three steps: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based acoustic feature extraction, matching via dynamic time warping (DTW), and performance score regression. The second system is an end-to-end system with CNNs and the attention mechanism. It takes two acoustic feature sequences as input and directly predicts a performance score. We evaluate two proposed methods with our new open-access Yingcai Piano Performance Evaluation Phase III Dataset (YCU-PPE-III) that contains more than 2000 piano audio pieces recorded in multiple real test sessions. Experimental results show that the modularized system achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.79 in a 0-100-point range. Another end-to-end system also achieves an MAE of 4.40, which shows that it is possible to train a robust end-to-end piano performance evaluation system with only two thousand audio pieces.",

      "abstract": "Multi-task dense retrieval models can be used to retrieve documents from a common corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) for different open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. However, (CITATION) shows that jointly learning different QA tasks with one dense model is not always beneficial due to corpus inconsistency. For example, SQuAD only focuses on a small set of Wikipedia articles while datasets like NQ and Trivia cover more entries, and joint training on their union can cause performance degradation. To solve this problem, we propose to train individual dense passage retrievers (DPR) for different tasks and aggregate their predictions during test time, where we use uncertainty estimation as weights to indicate how probable a specific query belongs to each expert's expertise. Our method reaches state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmark QA datasets, with up to 10% improvement in top-100 accuracy compared to a joint-training multi-task DPR on SQuAD. We also show that our method handles corpus inconsistency better than the joint-training DPR on a mixed subset of different QA datasets. Code and data are available at https://github.com/alexlimh/DPR_MUF.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, the reform of China’s pension system has aroused widespread concern in the society. Whether it is to provide for the elderly in housing, delay the retirement period, or increase the pension insurance, these are nothing more than the pressure problems faced by China’s aging population. Indoor environment is the place where the old people who live in old-age facilities spend the longest time in a day, so its reasonable design is even more important. From the perspective of the overall design of space environmental art, this paper discusses the design method of indoor art wood based on the influence of environmental art design based on environmental science on the indoor environment of Jiangnan old-age building. According to the physiological and psychological characteristics of the elderly, some problems in the indoor environment design of old-age facilities are deeply analyzed and discussed, so as to create a good living environment for the elderly.",

Considering the narrowband spectrogram as a sub-image of the wideband spectrogram, we tackle the joint modeling problem of the mixed-bandwidth data in an image classification manner. From this perspective, we elaborate several mixed-bandwidth joint training strategies under different training and test data scenarios. The proposed systems are able to flexibly handle the mixed-bandwidth speech data in a single speaker embedding model without any additional downsampling, upsampling, bandwidth extension, or padding operations. We conduct extensive experimental studies on the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by the SITW and NIST SRE 2016 datasets.",

The key technology is to estimate the real-time 3D face pose quickly and accurately. In response to this technical requirement, a method for real-time estimation of the face pose was proposed, and a virtual try-on prototype system was constructed. The method first used a depth camera to collect face data, analyzed the color and depth information of a single frontal image, and calculated the 3D face feature points; then combined the 2D real-time face feature points extracted from video frames, and used the direct linear transformation method to solve the real-time face pose. Based on the consumer-level depth camera Astra Mini and Unity3D engine, a prototype system was developed and a virtual try-on experiment was conducted; the accuracy of the pose estimation method was tested using the Biwi data set, and the robustness was tested under different lighting and partial face occlusion conditions. The results show that: the real-time performance, accuracy and robustness of the pose estimation method in this paper can satisfy the experience of the virtual try-on system.",

The speaker verification system deep learning based text-dependent generally needs a large scale text-dependent training data set which could be labor and cost expensive, especially for customized new wake-up words. In recent studies, voice conversion systems that can generate high quality synthesized speech of seen and unseen speakers have been proposed. Inspired by those works, we adopt two different voice conversion methods as well as the very simple re-sampling approach to generate new text-dependent speech samples for data augmentation purposes. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the Equal Error Rare performance from 6.51% to 4.51% in the scenario of limited training data.",

      "abstract": "Confusing-words are commonly encountered in real-life keyword spotting applications, which causes severe degradation of performance due to complex spoken terms and various kinds of words that sound similar to the predefined keywords. To enhance the wake word detection system's robustness on such scenarios, we investigate two data augmentation setups for training end-to-end KWS systems. One is involving the synthesized data from a multi-speaker speech synthesis system, and the other augmentation is performed by adding random noise to the acoustic feature. Experimental results show that augmentations help improve the system's robustness. Moreover, by augmenting the training set with the synthetic data generated by the multi-speaker text-to-speech system, we achieve a significant improvement regarding confusing words scenario.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the task of small-footprint keyword spotting under the far-field scenario.Far-field environments are commonly encountered in real-life speech applications, causing severe degradation of performance due to room reverberation and various kinds of noises.Our baseline system is built on the convolutional neural network trained with pooled data of both far-field and close-talking speech.To cope with the distortions, we develop three domain aware training systems, including the domain embedding system, the deep CORAL system, and the multi-task learning system.These methods incorporate domain knowledge into network training and improve the performance of the keyword classifier on far-field conditions.Experimental results show that our proposed methods manage to maintain the performance on the close-talking speech and achieve significant improvement on the far-field test set.",

The corpus contains roughly 85 hours of emotion-neutral recordings spoken by 218 native Chinese mandarin speakers. Their auxiliary attributes such as gender, age group and native accents are explicitly marked and provided in the corpus. Accordingly, transcripts in Chinese character-level and pinyin-level are provided along with the recordings. We present a baseline system that uses AISHELL-3 for multi-speaker Madarin speech synthesis. The multi-speaker speech synthesis system is an extension on Tacotron-2 where a speaker verification model and a corresponding loss regarding voice similarity are incorporated as the feedback constraint. We aim to use the presented corpus to build a robust synthesis model that is able to achieve zero-shot voice cloning. The system trained on this dataset also generalizes well on speakers that are never seen in the training process. Objective evaluation results from our experiments show that the proposed multi-speaker synthesis system achieves high voice similarity concerning both speaker embedding similarity and equal error rate measurement. The dataset, baseline system code and generated samples are available online.",

      "abstract": "Capturing the dynamics of facial expression progression in video is an essential and challenging task for facial expression recognition (FER). In this article, we propose an effective framework to address this challenge. We develop a C3D-based network architecture, 3D-Inception-ResNet, to extract spatial-temporal features from the dynamic facial expression image sequence. A Spatial-Temporal and Channel Attention Module (STCAM) is proposed to explicitly exploit the holistic spatial-temporal and channel-wise correlations among the extracted features. Specifically, the proposed STCAM calculates a channel-wise and a spatial-temporal-wise attention map to enhance the features along the corresponding feature dimensions for more representative features. We evaluate our method on three popular dynamic facial expression recognition datasets, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, and MMI. Experimental results show that our method achieves better or comparable performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "For facial expression recognition, this paper proposes a cross-connected AlexNet improved convolutional neural network model. In general, due to lack of image information and noise interference, traditional machine learning methods lack robustness and poor recognition rate. Based on the advantages of deep learning in feature extraction, this paper adds a convolution layer and a pooling layer to the original AlexNet network structure, and uses the cross-connect method to extract low-level features from the network structure and combines advanced functions to construct a Classifier. The trainable features are used to extract feature convolution kernels, and then the pooling layer performs downsampling to eliminate unimportant information, reduce the amount of information calculation, and finally use the Softmax classifier for classification and recognition. Conduct comparative tests before and after the improvement to verify the performance improvement of the improved method.",

For the mask detection task, we train deep convolutional neural networks with filter-bank energies, gender-aware features, and speaker-aware features. Support Vector Machines follows as the back-end classifiers for binary prediction on the extracted deep embeddings. Several data augmentation schemes are used to increase the quantity of training data and improve our models' robustness, including speed perturbation, SpecAugment, and random erasing. For the speech breath monitoring task, we investigate different bottleneck features based on the Bi-LSTM structure. Experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform the baselines and achieve 0.746 PCC and 78.8% UAR on the Breathing and Mask evaluation set, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Connected vehicles leverage wireless interfaces to broadcast their motion state information for improved traffic safety and efficiency. It is crucial for their motion claims (location and velocity) to be verified at the receivers to detect spoofing attacks. Existing approaches typically require multiple cooperative distributed verifiers, which is not applicable to vehicular networks. In this work, we propose a secure motion verification scheme based on Angle-of-Arrival and Frequency-of-Arrival that only requires a single verifier, by exploiting opportunistic signal reflection paths in the environment to create multiple virtual verifiers. We analyze the security of our scheme both theoretically and under realistic road topology. We also carry out real-world experiments with two vehicles in a campus environment, and results show that our scheme can accurately detect false motion claims in a low relative speed vehicular network.",

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is an effective way to solve road traffic problems. Aiming at the optimization of urban road traffic information acquisition system, a constrained optimization mathematical model of intelligent traffic information acquisition system with conference network is established by using the comprehensive evaluation function of connectivity and coverage of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Connection and coverage are constraints. The penalty function method is used to further transform the model into an unconstrained optimization model. Taking the road in the Second Ring Road of Beijing as an example, the simulation experiment is carried out by using radio frequency identification technology. The results show that compared with the initial manual layout, the evaluation function value of the optimized layout can be increased by 1.71% and 3.18% by RFID technology. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology can optimize the traffic information acquisition system.",

      "abstract": "Modeling voices for multiple speakers and multiple languages in one text-to-speech system has been a challenge for a long time. This paper presents an extension on Tacotron2 to achieve bilingual multispeaker speech synthesis when there are limited data for each language. We achieve cross-lingual synthesis, including code-switching cases, between English and Mandarin for monolingual speakers. The two languages share the same phonemic representations for input, while the language attribute and the speaker identity are independently controlled by language tokens and speaker embeddings, respectively. In addition, we investigate the model's performance on the cross-lingual synthesis, with and without a bilingual dataset during training. With the bilingual dataset, not only can the model generate high-fidelity speech for all speakers concerning the language they speak, but also can generate accented, yet fluent and intelligible speech for monolingual speakers regarding non-native language. For example, the Mandarin speaker can speak English fluently. Furthermore, the model trained with bilingual dataset is robust for code-switching text-to-speech, as shown in our results and provided samples.{https://caizexin.github.io/mlms-syn-samples/index.html}.",

      "abstract": "Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) based models have been introduced to deep learning-based target speaker separation. In this paper, we propose an Attention-based neural network (Atss-Net) in the spectrogram domain for the task. It allows the network to compute the correlation between each feature parallelly, and using shallower layers to extract more features, compared with the CNN-LSTM architecture. Experimental results show that our Atss-Net yields better performance than the VoiceFilter, although it only contains half of the parameters. Furthermore, our proposed model also demonstrates promising performance in speech enhancement.",

      "abstract": "The INTERSPEECH 2020 Far-Field Speaker Verification Challenge (FFSVC 2020) addresses three different research problems under well-defined conditions: far-field text-dependent speaker verification from single microphone array, far-field text-independent speaker verification from single microphone array, and far-field text-dependent speaker verification from distributed microphone arrays. All three tasks pose a cross-channel challenge to the participants. To simulate the real-life scenario, the enrollment utterances are recorded from close-talk cellphone, while the test utterances are recorded from the far-field microphone arrays. In this paper, we describe the database, the challenge, and the baseline system, which is based on a ResNet-based deep speaker network with cosine similarity scoring. For a given utterance, the speaker embeddings of different channels are equally averaged as the final embedding. The baseline system achieves minDCFs of 0.62, 0.66, and 0.64 and EERs of 6.27%, 6.55%, and 7.18% for task 1, task 2, and task 3, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the submitted system for the second DIHARD Speech Diarization Challenge from the DKULENOVO team. Our diarization system includes multiple modules, namely voice activity detection (VAD), segmentation, speaker embedding extraction, similarity scoring, clustering, resegmentation and overlap detection. For each module, we explore different techniques to enhance performance. Our final submission employs the ResNet-LSTM based VAD, the Deep ResNet based speaker embedding, the LSTM based similarity scoring and spectral clustering. Variational Bayes (VB) diarization is applied in the resegmentation stage and overlap detection also brings slight improvement. Our proposed system achieves 18.84% DER in Track1 and 27.90% DER in Track2. Although our systems have reduced the DERs by 27.5% and 31.7% relatively against the official baselines, we believe that the diarization task is still very difficult.",

Far-field environments are commonly encountered in real-life speech applications, causing severe degradation of performance due to room reverberation and various kinds of noises. Our baseline system is built on the convolutional neural network trained with pooled data of both far-field and close-talking speech. To cope with the distortions, we develop three domain aware training systems, including the domain embedding system, the deep CORAL system, and the multi-task learning system. These methods incorporate domain knowledge into network training and improve the performance of the keyword classifier on far-field conditions. Experimental results show that our proposed methods manage to maintain the performance on the close-talking speech and achieve significant improvement on the far-field test set.",

      "abstract": "Transformers are powerful for sequence modeling. Nearly all state-of-the-art language models and pre-trained language models are based on the Transformer architecture. However, it distinguishes sequential tokens only with the token position index. We hypothesize that better contextual representations can be generated from the Transformer with richer positional information. To verify this, we propose a segment-aware Transformer (Segatron), by replacing the original token position encoding with a combined position encoding of paragraph, sentence, and token. We first introduce the segment-aware mechanism to Transformer-XL, which is a popular Transformer-based language model with memory extension and relative position encoding. We find that our method can further improve the Transformer-XL base model and large model, achieving 17.1 perplexity on the WikiText-103 dataset. We further investigate the pre-training masked language modeling task with Segatron. Experimental results show that BERT pre-trained with Segatron (SegaBERT) can outperform BERT with vanilla Transformer on various NLP tasks, and outperforms RoBERTa on zero-shot sentence representation learning.",

      "abstract": "Despite the significant improvements in speaker recognition enabled by deep neural networks, unsatisfactory performance persists under noisy environments. In this paper, we train the speaker embedding network to learn the \"clean\" embedding of the noisy utterance. Specifically, the network is trained with the original speaker identification loss with an auxiliary within-sample variability-invariant loss. This auxiliary variability-invariant loss is used to learn the same embedding among the clean utterance and its noisy copies and prevents the network from encoding the undesired noises or variabilities into the speaker representation. Furthermore, we investigate the data preparation strategy for generating clean and noisy utterance pairs on-the-fly. The strategy generates different noisy copies for the same clean utterance at each training step, helping the speaker embedding network generalize better under noisy environments. Experiments on VoxCeleb1 indicate that the proposed training framework improves the performance of the speaker verification system in both clean and noisy conditions.",

We aim to meet the data requirement for far-field microphone array based speaker verification since most of the publicly available databases are single channel close-talking and text-independent. The database contains recordings of 340 people in rooms designed for the far-field scenario. Recordings are captured by multiple microphone arrays located in different directions and distance to the speaker and a high-fidelity close-talking microphone. Besides, we propose a set of end-to-end neural network based baseline systems that adopt single-channel data for training. Moreover, we propose a testing background aware enrollment augmentation strategy to further enhance the performance. Results show that the fusion systems could achieve 3.29% EER in the far-field enrollment far field testing task and 4.02% EER in the close-talking enrollment and far-field testing task.",

      "abstract": "The semantics of a text is manifested only by what is read, but also by what is read. In this article, we will study how those implicit not read information such as end-of-paragraph (EOP) and end-of-sequence (EOS) affect the quality of text generation. Transformer-based pretrained language models (LMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate long continuations with good quality. This model gives us a platform for the first time to demonstrate that paragraph layouts and text endings are also important components of human writing. Specifically, we find that pretrained LMs can generate better continuations by learning to generate the end of the paragraph (EOP) in the fine-tuning stage. Experimental results on English story generation show that EOP can lead to higher BLEU score and lower EOS perplexity. To further investigate the relationship between text ending and EOP, we conduct experiments with a self-collected Chinese essay dataset on Chinese-GPT2, a character level LM without paragraph breaker or EOS during pre-training. Experimental results show that the Chinese GPT2 can generate better essay endings with paragraph information. Experiments on both English stories and Chinese essays demonstrate that learning to end paragraphs can benefit the continuation generation with pretrained LMs.",

      "abstract": "A number of researchers have recently questioned the necessity of increasingly complex neural network (NN) architectures. In particular, several recent papers have shown that simpler, properly tuned models are at least competitive across several NLP tasks. In this work, we show that this is also the case for text generation from structured and unstructured data. We consider neural table-to-text generation and neural question generation (NQG) tasks for text generation from structured and unstructured data, respectively. Table-to-text generation aims to generate a description based on a given table, and NQG is the task of generating a question from a given passage where the generated question can be answered by a certain sub-span of the passage using NN models. Experimental results demonstrate that a basic attention-based seq2seq model trained with the exponential moving average technique achieves the state of the art in both tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/h-shahidi/2birds-gen.",

      "abstract": "In this article, our recent efforts on directly modeling utterance-level aggregation for speaker and language recognition is summarized. First, an on-the-fly data loader for efficient network training is proposed. The data loader acts as a bridge between the full-length utterances and the network. It generates mini-batch samples on the fly, which allows batch-wise variable-length training and online data augmentation. Second, the traditional dictionary learning and Baum-Welch statistical accumulation mechanisms are applied to the network structure, and a learnable dictionary encoding (LDE) layer is introduced. The former accumulates discriminative statistics from the variable-length input sequence and outputs a single fixed-dimensional utterance-level representation. Experiments were conducted on four different datasets, namely NIST LRE 2007, AP17-OLR, SITW, and NIST SRE 2016. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed batch-wise variable-length training with online data augmentation and the LDE layer, which significantly outperforms the baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a bus standard commonly used in the automotive industry for connecting Electronic Control Units (ECUs) within a vehicle. The broadcast nature of this protocol, along with the lack of authentication or strong integrity guarantees for frames, allows for arbitrary data injection/modification and impersonation of the ECUs. While mitigation strategies have been proposed to counter these attacks, high implementation costs or violation of backward compatibility hinder their deployment. In this work, we first examine the shortcomings of state-of-the-art CAN intrusion detection and identification systems that rely on multiple frames to detect misbehavior and attribute it to a particular ECU, and show that they are vulnerable to a Hill-Climbing-style attack. Then we propose SIMPLE, a real-time intrusion detection and identification system that exploits physical layer features of ECUs, which would not only allow an attack to be detected using a single frame but also be effectively nullified. SIMPLE has low computational and data acquisition costs, and its efficacy is demonstrated by both in-lab experiments with automotive-grade CAN transceivers as well as in-vehicle experiments, where average equal error rates of close to 0% and 0.8985% are achieved, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, surveillance cameras are widely deployed in public places, and the general crime rate has been reduced significantly due to these ubiquitous devices. Usually, these cameras provide cues and evidence after crimes are conducted, while they are rarely used to prevent or stop criminal activities in time. It is both time and labor consuming to manually monitor a large amount of video data from surveillance cameras. Therefore, automatically recognizing violent behaviors from video signals becomes essential. This paper summarizes several existing video datasets for violence detection and proposes the RWF-2000 database with 2,000 videos captured by surveillance cameras in real-world scenes. Also, we present a new method that utilizes both the merits of 3D-CNNs and optical flow, namely Flow Gated Network. The proposed approach obtains an accuracy of 87.25% on the test set of our proposed database. The database and source codes are currently open to access.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol intoxication can affect people both physically and psychologically, and one's speech will also become different. However, detecting the intoxicated state from the speech is a challenging task. In this paper, we first implement the baseline model with ComParE feature and then explore the influence of the speaker information on the intoxication detection task. Besides, we apply a ResNet18 based model to this task. The model contains three parts: a representation learning subnetwork with Deep Residual Neural Network(ResNet) of 18-layer, a global average pooling(GAP) layer and a classifier of 2 fully connected layers. Since we cannot perform speaker z-normalization on the variant-length feature input, we employ the batch z-normalization to train the proposed model. It also achieves similar improvement like applying the speaker normalization to the baseline method. Experimental results show that speaker normalization on baseline model and batch z-normalization on ResNet18 based model provides 4.9% and 3.8% improvement respectively. The results show that speaker normalization can improve the performance of both the baseline model and the proposed model.",

Our system pipeline consists of three main components, including data augmentation, frame-level feature extraction, and utterance-level modeling. First, we perform speed perturbation to increase the diversity and amount of training data. Second, we extract several kinds of frame-level features, including the hand-crafted acoustic features as well as the deep phonetic features. Third, we aggregate the frame-level features into fixed-dimensional utterance-level representation through i- vector and x-vector modelings. We also propose a deep residual network to obtain the utterance-level language posteriors in an end-to-end manner. Our submitted primary system achieves C <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">avg</inf> of 0.0499, 0.0146, and 0.0135 for the corresponding short- utterance, confusing language and open-set tasks on the evaluation set.",

      "abstract": "Aspherical surfaces can provide significant benefits to a wide variety of optical systems, but manufacturing high-precision aspherical surfaces has historically been limited by the ability to measure them. Null testing has always been the ideal method in aspherical measurement. However, in many cases, it is hard to realize null testing for complex surfaces, especially for convex surfaces in complicated forms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compensation method combining a spherical mirror and a computer generated hologram (CGH) to achieve the null testing of the convex aspherical surface. Firstly, we introduce our self-developed mathematical models in the hybrid compensation method, including optics alignment model, distortion correction model and spherical surface error removing model. Then the performance of our proposed method is analyzed by a null testing experiment of an off-axis convex ellipsoid mirror. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can accomplish the hybrid compensation testing of convex aspherical surfaces effectively, and it can also bring much to the application of our method in convex aspherical surface testing.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes our DKU replay detection system for the ASVspoof 2019 challenge.The goal is to develop spoofing countermeasure for automatic speaker recognition in physical access scenario.We leverage the countermeasure system pipeline from four aspects, including the data augmentation, feature representation, classification, and fusion.First, we introduce an utterance-level deep learning framework for antispoofing.It receives the variable-length feature sequence and outputs the utterance-level scores directly.Based on the framework, we try out various kinds of input feature representations extracted from either the magnitude spectrum or phase spectrum.Besides, we also perform the data augmentation strategy by applying the speed perturbation on the raw waveform.Our best single system employs a residual neural network trained by the speed-perturbed group delay gram.It achieves EER of 1.04% on the development set, as well as EER of 1.08% on the evaluation set.Finally, using the simple average score from several single systems can further improve the performance.EER of 0.24% on the development set and 0.66% on the evaluation set is obtained for our primary system.",

We investigate the whole system pipeline for the far-field speaker verification, including data pre-processing, short-term spectral feature representation, utterance-level speaker modeling, back-end scoring, and score normalization. Our best single system employs a residual neural network trained with angular softmax loss. Also, the weighted prediction error algorithms can further improve performance. It achieves 0.3668 minDCF and 5.58% EER on the evaluation set by using a simple cosine similarity scoring. Finally, the submitted primary system obtains 0.3532 minDCF and 4.96% EER on the evaluation set.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a conditional neural network architecture for Mandarin Chinese polyphone disambiguation.The system is composed of a bidirectional recurrent neural network component acting as a sentence encoder to accumulate the context correlations, followed by a prediction network that maps the polyphonic character embeddings along with the conditions to corresponding pronunciations.We obtain the word-level condition from a pre-trained word-to-vector lookup table.One goal of polyphone disambiguation is to address the homograph problem existing in the front-end processing of Mandarin Chinese textto-speech system.Our system achieves an accuracy of 94.69% on a publicly available polyphonic character dataset.To further validate our choices on the conditional feature, we investigate polyphone disambiguation systems with multi-level conditions respectively.The experimental results show that both the sentence-level and the word-level conditional embedding features are able to attain good performance for Mandarin Chinese polyphone disambiguation.",

In this paper, we propose a Sliced Attention-based neural network (Sams-Net) in the spectrogram domain for the music source separation task. It enables spectral feature interactions with multi-head attention mechanism, achieves easier parallel computing and has a larger receptive field compared with LSTMs and CNNs respectively. Experimental results on the MUSDB18 dataset show that the proposed method, with fewer parameters, outperforms most of the state-of-the-art DNN-based methods.",

      "abstract": "Spatial-temporal structure of expression frames plays a critical role in the task of video based facial expression recognition (FER). In this paper, we propose a 3D CNN based framework to learn the spatial-temporal structure from expression frames for video-based FER. First, we use the data labeled with identities to train an identity network to capture the facial biometric features from expression frames. Second, we remove the impact of facial biometric features from the expression features and construct typical facial expression (TFE) features. Then, we feed the TFE features to a 3D network to discover spatial-temporal structure of expression frames. In the end, we feed the spatial-temporal vector to a fully-connected layer to get a vector for classification. The proposed method achieves comparable accuracy with the state-of-art of 88.54% on Oulu-CASIA, and is efficient to be used for the task of video-based FER.",

Measurements are made from sensors placed in the mouth to capture real-time vocal tract variable trajectories. EMA is used in linguistics and language-related research to study phonetics, in particular, articulation (how sounds are made). <br> <h3>Data</h3><br> Articulatory measurements were made using the <a href=\"https://www.ndigital.com/\">NDI</a> electromagnetic articulography wave research system. Subjects had six sensors placed in various locations in their mouth and one reference sensor was placed on the bridge of their nose. For simultaneous recording of speech signals, subjects also wore a head-mounted close-talk microphone. <br> Speakers engaged in four different types of recording sessions: one in which they read complete sentences or short texts, and three sessions in which they read related words of a specific common consonant, vowel or tone. <br> Audio data is presented as single channel, 16kHz, 16-bit flac compressed wav files. Articulography data is stored as UTF-8 plain text files. <br> <h3>Samples</h3><br> Please view the following samples: <br> <ul><br> <li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2019S14.yue.flac\">Cantonese Speech</a></li><br> <li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2019S14.yue.tsv\">Cantonese Sensor Data</a></li><br> <li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2019S14.yue.wco\">Cantonese Parameter Data</a></li><br> <li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2019S14.cmn.flac\">Mandarin Speech</a></li><br> <li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2019S14.cmn.tsv\">Mandarin Sensor Data</a></li><br> <li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2019S14.cmn.wco\">Mandarin Parameter Data</a></li><br> </ul><br> <h3>Updates</h3><br> None at this time. </br> Portions © 2019 Duke Kunshan University, © 2019 Jinan University, © 2019 Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania",

In this paper, we present a new method that estimates F0 contour for electrolaryngeal (EL) speech enhancement in Mandarin. Our system explores the usage of phonetic feature to improve the quality of EL speech. First, we train an acoustic model for EL speech and generate the phoneme posterior probabilities feature sequence for each input EL speech utterance. Then we employ the phonetic feature for F0 contour generation rather than the acoustic feature. The experimental results indicate that the EL speech is significantly enhanced under the adoption of the phonetic feature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notable improvement regarding the intelligibility and the similarity with normal speech.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present an end-to-end language identification framework, the attention-based Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Long-short Term Memory (CNN-BLSTM). The model is performed on the utterance level, which means the utterance-level decision can be directly obtained from the output of the neural network. To handle speech utterances with entire arbitrary and potentially long duration, we combine CNN-BLSTM model with a self-attentive pooling layer together. The front-end CNN-BLSTM module plays a role as local pattern extractor for the variable-length inputs, and the following self-attentive pooling layer is built on top to get the fixed-dimensional utterance-level representation. We conducted experiments on NIST LRE07 closed-set task, and the results reveal that the proposed attention-based CNN-BLSTM model achieves comparable error reduction with other state-of-the-art utterance-level neural network approaches for all 3 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds duration tasks.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a simple combination of passage retrieval using off-the-shelf IR techniques and a BERT reader was found to be very effective for question answering directly on Wikipedia, yielding a large improvement over the previous state of the art on a standard benchmark dataset. In this paper, we present a data augmentation technique using distant supervision that exploits positive as well as negative examples. We apply a stage-wise approach to fine tuning BERT on multiple datasets, starting with data that is \"furthest\" from the test data and ending with the \"closest\". Experimental results show large gains in effectiveness over previous approaches on English QA datasets, and we establish new baselines on two recent Chinese QA datasets.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle platooning systems are often equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies to improve both the road efficiency and road safety by exchanging vehicle information over wireless networks to maintain relatively small inter-vehicle distance. The road safety often relies on the quality of service delivered by the V2V communication. The V2V networks are, however, subject to channel fading and often have limited communication bandwidth. The limited bandwidth inevitably compromises the road safety as the vehicular network will easily get congested if the number of vehicles joining the network increases. To address the challenges of ensuring vehicle safety under unreliable wireless network with limited bandwidth, this paper first uses a two-state Markov chain to model the channel fading in vehicular networks. Under the Markov chain model, this paper further develops a novel distributed event triggered strategies under which the vehicle platooning system achieves stochastic L <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> string stability while ensuring an efficient use of the limited communication bandwidth. The simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods.",

In contrast to\\nmost question answering and reading comprehension models today, which operate\\nover small amounts of input text, our system integrates best practices from IR\\nwith a BERT-based reader to identify answers from a large corpus of Wikipedia\\narticles in an end-to-end fashion. We report large improvements over previous\\nresults on a standard benchmark test collection, showing that fine-tuning\\npretrained BERT with SQuAD is sufficient to achieve high accuracy in\\nidentifying answer spans.\\n",

      "abstract": "We tackle the problem of context reconstruction in Chinese dialogue, where the task is to replace pronouns, zero pronouns, and other referring expressions with their referent nouns so that sentences can be processed in isolation without context. Following a standard decomposition of the context reconstruction task into referring expression detection and coreference resolution, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture for separately and jointly accomplishing this task. Key features of this model include POS and position encoding using CNNs and a novel pronoun masking mechanism. One perennial problem in building such models is the paucity of training data, which we address by augmenting previously-proposed methods to generate a large amount of realistic training data. The combination of more data and better models yields accuracy higher than the state-of-the-art method in coreference resolution and end-to-end context reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "Different subjects may express a specific expression in different ways due to inter-subject variabilities. In this work, besides training deep-learned facial expression feature (emotional feature), we also consider the influence of latent face identity feature such as the shape or appearance of face. We propose an identity and emotion joint learning approach with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance the performance of facial expression recognition (FER) tasks. First, we learn the emotion and identity features separately using two different CNNs with their corresponding training data. Second, we concatenate these two features together as a deep-learned Tandem Facial Expression (TFE) Feature and feed it to the subsequent fully connected layers to form a new model. Finally, we perform joint learning on the newly merged network using only the facial expression training data. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves 99.31 and 84.29 percent accuracy on the CK+ and the FER+ database, respectively, which outperforms the residual network baseline as well as many other state-of-the-art methods.",

NetFV and NetVLAD layers are the differentiable implementations of the standard Fisher Vector and Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) methods, respectively. Both of them can encode a sequence of feature vectors into a fixed dimensional vector which is very important to process those variable-length utterances. We first present the relevances and differences between the classical i-vector and the aforementioned encoding schemes. Then, we construct a flexible end-to-end framework including a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and an encoding layer (NetFV or NetVLAD) for the language identification task. Experimental results on the NIST LRE 2007 close-set task show that the proposed system achieves significant EER reductions against the conventional i-vector baseline and the CNN temporal average pooling system, respectively.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the acquisition of the Duke Kunshan University Jinan University Electromagnetic Articulography (DKU-JNU-EMA) database in terms of aligned acoustics and articulatory data on Mandarin and Chinese dialects. This database currently includes data from multiple individuals in Mandarin and three Chinese dialects, namely Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew. There are 2–7 native speakers for each language or dialect. Acoustic data is obtained by one headmounted close talk microphone while articulatory data is obtained by the NDI electromagnetic articulography wave research system. The DKU-JNU-EMA database is now in preparation for public release to help advance research in areas of acoustic-to-articulatory inversion, speech production, dialect recognition, and experimental phonetics. Along with the database, we propose an acoustic-to-articulatory inversion baseline using deep neural networks. Moreover, we show that by concatenating the dimension reduced phoneme posterior probability feature with MFCC features at the feature level as tandem feature, the inversion system performance is enhanced.",

      "abstract": "Lexical content variability in different utterances is the key challenge for text-independent speaker verification. In this paper, we investigate using supervector which has ability to reduce the impact of lexical content mismatch among different utterances for supervised speaker embedding learning. A DNN acoustic model is used to align a feature sequence to a set of senones and generate centered and normalized first order statistics supervector. Statistics vectors from similar senones are placed together and reshaped to an image to maintain the local continuity and correlation. The supervector image is then fed into residual convolutional neural network. The deep speaker embedding features are the outputs of the last hidden layer of the network and we employ a PLDA back-end for the subsequent modeling. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional GMM-UBM i-vector system and is complementary to the DNN-UBM i-vector system. The score level fusion system achieves 1.26% ERR and 0.260 DCF10 cost on the NIST SRE 10 extended core condition 5 task.",

More specifically, The SOM features are represented by the distances between the current feature vector and the weight vectors of SOM neurons learned in an unsupervised manner. After fetching these features, we apply sub-sequence Dynamic Time Warping (S-DTW) to detect the occurrences of keywords in the test data. We evaluate the performance of these features on the TIMIT English database. After concatenating the SOM features and the GMM based features together, we achieve an improvement of 7.77% and 7.74% on Mean Average Precision (MAP) and P@10 on average.",

      "abstract": "The classical i-vectors and the latest end-to-end deep speaker embeddings are the two representative categories of utterancelevel representations in automatic speaker verification systems.Traditionally, once i-vectors or deep speaker embeddings are extracted, we rely on an extra length normalization step to normalize the representations into unit-length hyperspace before back-end modeling.In this paper, we explore how the neural network learns length-normalized deep speaker embeddings in an end-to-end manner.To this end, we add a length normalization layer followed by a scale layer before the output layer of the common classification network.We conducted experiments on the verification task of the Voxceleb1 dataset.The results show that integrating this simple step in the end-to-end training pipeline significantly boosts the performance of speaker verification.In the testing stage of our L2-normalized end-to-end system, a simple inner-product can achieve the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed an effective method of facial expression recognition based on a G-2DPCA feature and Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC). Gabor filters with five scales and eight directions are first employed for feature extraction. To address the high dimension of Gabor features, we select one out of forty Gabor filters with an optimal parameter pair of scales and directions to filter facial images. Two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) is utilized for image representation and data dimension reduction. It retains the 2D geometric structure of an image, and the image matrix does not need to transform into a vector, which reducing the computation time greatly. Finally, Gabor plus 2DPCA (G-2PCA) features are regarded as the atoms of dictionary in SRC. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance than the existing algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, malicious actors may spread false information to undermine the safety and efficiency of the vehicular traffic stream. Thus, vehicles must determine how to respond to the contents of messages which maybe false even though they are authenticated in the sense that receivers can verify contents were not tampered with and originated from a verifiable transmitter. Existing solutions to find appropriate actions are inadequate since they separately address trust and decision, require the honest majority (more honest ones than malicious), and do not incorporate driver preferences in the decision-making process. In this work, we propose a novel trust-aware decision-making framework without requiring an honest majority. It securely determines the likelihood of reported road events despite the presence of false data, and consequently provides the optimal decision for the vehicles. The basic idea of our framework is to leverage the implied effect of the road event to verify the consistency between each vehicle's reported data and actual behavior, and determine the data trustworthiness and event belief by integrating the Bayes' rule and Dempster Shafer Theory. The resulting belief serves as inputs to a utility maximization framework focusing on both safety and efficiency. This framework considers the two basic necessities of the Intelligent Transportation System and also incorporates drivers' preferences to decide the optimal action. Simulation results show the robustness of our framework under the multiple-vehicle attack, and different balances between safety and efficiency can be achieved via selecting appropriate human preference factors based on the driver's risk-taking willingness.",

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic facial expression recognition method by using geometric and texture features. In our system, the facial landmark movements and texture variations upon pairwise images are used to perform the dynamic facial expression recognition tasks. For one facial expression sequence, pairwise images are created between the first frame and each of its subsequent frames. Integration of both geometric and texture features further enhances the representation of the facial expressions. Finally, Support Vector Machine is used for facial expression recognition. Experiments conducted on the extended Cohn-Kanade database show that our proposed method can achieve a competitive performance with other methods.",

      "abstract": "A novel interpretable end-to-end learning scheme for language identification is proposed. It is in line with the classical GMM i-vector methods both theoretically and practically. In the end-to-end pipeline, a general encoding layer is employed on top of the front-end CNN, so that it can encode the variable-length input sequence into an utterance level vector automatically. After comparing with the state-of-the-art GMM i-vector methods, we give insights into CNN, and reveal its role and effect in the whole pipeline. We further introduce a general encoding layer, illustrating the reason why they might be appropriate for language identification. We elaborate on several typical encoding layers, including a temporal average pooling layer, a recurrent encoding layer and a novel learnable dictionary encoding layer. We conducted experiment on NIST LRE07 closed-set task, and the results show that our proposed end-to-end systems achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "A novel learnable dictionary encoding layer is proposed in this paper for end-to-end language identification. It is inline with the conventional GMM i-vector approach both theoretically and practically. We imitate the mechanism of traditional GMM training and Supervector encoding procedure on the top of CNN. The proposed layer can accumulate high-order statistics from variable-length input sequence and generate an utterance level fixed-dimensional vector representation. Unlike the conventional methods, our new approach provides an end-to-end learning framework, where the inherent dictionary are learned directly from the loss function. The dictionaries and the encoding representation for the classifier are learned jointly. The representation is orderless and therefore appropriate for language identification. We conducted a preliminary experiment on NIST LRE07 closed-set task, and the results reveal that our proposed dictionary encoding layer achieves significant error reduction comparing with the simple average pooling.",

      "abstract": "A novel interpretable end-to-end learning scheme for language identification is proposed. It is in line with the classical GMM i-vector methods both theoretically and practically. In the end-to-end pipeline, a general encoding layer is employed on top of the frontend CNN, so that it can encode the variable-length input sequence into an utterance level vector automatically. After comparing with the state-of-the-art GMM i-vector methods, we give insights into CNN, and reveal its role and effect in the whole pipeline. We further introduce a general encoding layer, illustrating the reason why they might be appropriate for language identification. We elaborate on several typical encoding layers, including a temporal average pooling layer, a recurrent encoding layer and a novel learnable dictionary encoding layer. We conducted experiment on NIST LRE07 closed-set task, and the results show that our proposed end-to-end systems achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Summary Semi‐Markovian jump systems are more general than Markovian jump systems in modeling practical systems. On the other hand, the finite‐time stochastic stability is also more effective than stochastic stability in practical systems. This paper focuses on the finite‐time stochastic stability, exponential stochastic stability, and stabilization of semi‐Markovian jump systems with time‐varying delay. First, a new stability condition is presented to guarantee the finite‐time stochastic stability of the system by using a new Lyapunov‐Krasovskii functional combined with Wirtinger‐based integral inequality. Second, the stability criterion is further proved to guarantee the exponential stochastic stability of the system. Moreover, a controller design method is also presented according to the stability criterion. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate that the proposed stability condition is less conservative than other existing results. Additionally, we use the proposed method to design a controller for a load frequency control system to illustrate the effectiveness of the method in a practical system of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Electrolarynx (EL) is a speaking-aid device that helps laryngectomees who have their larynx removed to generate voice. However, the voice generated by EL is unnatural and unintelligible due to its flat pitch and strong vibration noise. Targeting these challenges, previous works show that the electrolaryngeal speech can be enhanced using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based voice conversion (VC). Although effective in improving the naturalness, it degrades the intelligibility of the converted speech. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid approach using both Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and GMM methods. For better intelligibility, we apply the NMF to estimate the high quality spectral features. For better naturalness, we use the GMM with dynamic trajectory constraint to recover a smoothed F <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> . Additionally, to suppress the EL vibration noise, we include the 0 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> MCC coefficient in the GMM-based VC. The proposed method significantly increases the F <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> dynamic range, reduces vibration noise, and improves both speech naturalness and intelligibility. One hundred pairs of the normal and electrolaryngeal speech in daily mandarin are recorded as our evaluation data. Experimental results show that our proposed hybrid method reduces the mel-cepstral distortion by 7.1 dB and increases the F <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> correlation coefficient to 0.54.",

First, the influence of the learning factor on global exploration and the local exploitation of the algorithm is analyzed, and the parameter adjustment mechanism which can balance the two search capabilities is designed reasonably. Secondly, the PSO is embedded into the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and an Improved Hybrid Gravitational Search Algorithm (IHGSA) is proposed. Finally, 21 benchmark test functions are programmed and calculated in comparison with the results of the Gravity Search Algorithm (GSA). The numerical results show that the new algorithm balanced the global exploration and local exploitation. The IHGSA are also better than the Gravity Search Algorithm (GSA) in convergence rate and convergence accuracy.",

The current approaches of using sequence-to-sequence models with attention often produce non-thematic poems. We present a conditional variational autoencoder with augmented word2vec architecture that explicitly represents the topic or theme information. This approach significantly improves the relevance of the generated poems by representing each line of the poem not only in a context-sensitive manner but also in a holistic way that is highly related to the given keyword and the learned topic. The proposed augmented word2vec model further improves the rhythm and symmetry. We also present a straightforward evaluation metric RHYTHM score to automatically measure the rule-consistency of generated poems. Tests show that 45.24% generated poems by our model are judged by humans to be written by real people.",

      "abstract": "Future automated vehicles will rely on V2V communication to exchange information about their motion states and take corresponding control actions, to enhance road safety and efficiency. Evaluating the trustworthiness of such data in a VANET is critical as malicious vehicles may inject false data which will undermine the benefits of V2V communication and lead to severe consequences, such as collisions. Existing solutions are inadequate since they assume an honest majority of vehicles. In this work, we propose a novel data trust framework, which determines the truthfulness of each received message on the fly, and is able to detect false data and securely track vehicles even when they report false information. The basic idea is to verify the implied effect of vehicle's reported data using secure sensing mechanisms from the wireless physical layer, which is wrapped within a dynamic vehicle tracking system using extended Kalman filter. Our framework does require at least one honest neighboring vehicle, and simulation results show that it is effective in most highway traffic scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The measurement of semantic similarity is a fundamental task in natural language processing. In the settings of a community question answering (cQA) system, it is essentially a classification problem: given a pair of questions, label it similar, relevant, or irrelevant. Traditional methods, either those at word level or at sentence level, typically require many lexical and syntactic resources, which are not available in languages other than English. In addition, there does not exist a finely annotated dataset for our purpose. In this paper, we constructed a dataset containing 4,322 labelled question pairs in Chinese, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first open Chinese dataset for question similarity classification. We propose a novel framework for measuring the semantic similarity between sentences based on the architecture of a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoderdecoder, which does not require lexical or syntactic resources. We solve the problem of lacking labelled data by first training the RNN using a larger dataset of question pairs that are automatically labelled with heuristic scores, and then fine-tuning it with our smaller, manually labelled dataset. The two-step training scheme improves the accuracy of classification compared to single-step training, and also outperforms other traditional models. The proposed model is capable of both classification and candidate ranking.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses deep face recognition (FR) problem under open-set protocol, where ideal face features are expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen metric space. However, few existing algorithms can effectively achieve this criterion. To this end, we propose the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss that enables convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn angularly discriminative features. Geometrically, A-Softmax loss can be viewed as imposing discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold. Moreover, the size of angular margin can be quantitatively adjusted by a parameter m. We further derive specific m to approximate the ideal feature criterion. Extensive analysis and experiments on Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace Challenge 1 show the superiority of A-Softmax loss in FR tasks.",

      "abstract": "To predict and assess visual attention, saliencybased visual attention modeling is a popular approach. However, state-of-the-art models are developed for adults, in which children are not considered. Additionally, these models consider neither social cues like face, nor attention learning cues. The face is a vital part of visual attention. Psychological studies reveal that sub-facial areas are different in visual attention. Some models highlight faces in social scenes, but sub-facial areas are not taken into account. Attention learning reveals internal processing of visual attention. By learning how the cognitive system deals with visual stimuli, it is possible to predict visual attention behavior. In this paper, we propose a multilevel visual attention model to predict fixations of children when watching a talking face. Based on traditional saliency maps, the proposed model includes both separate facial areas and attention shift cue. An eye-tracking experiment is conducted to evaluate the model. Results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms conventional models in talking face scenes.",

Considering that the phonetic level features contain text information which should be preserved in the conversion task, we propose a method that only concatenates phonetic discriminant features and spectral features extracted from the same target speakers speech to train a JD-GMM. After the mapping relationship of these two features is trained, we can use phonetic discriminant features from source speaker to estimate target speaker's spectral features at conversion stage. The phonetic discriminant features are extracted using PCA from the output layer of a deep neural network (DNN) in an automatic speaker recognition (ASR) system. It can be seen as a low dimensional representation of the senone posteriors. We compare the proposed phonetically-aware method with conventional JD-GMM method on the Voice Conversion Challenge 2016 training database. The experimental results show that our proposed phonetically-aware feature method can obtain similar performance compared to the conventional JD-GMM in the case of using only target speech as training data.",

As opposed to LDA which fails to discover the local geometrical structure of the data manifold, LSDA finds a projection which maximizes the margin between i-vectors from different speakers at each local area. Since the number of samples varies in a wide range in each class, we improve LSDA by using adaptive k nearest neighbors in each class and modifying the corresponding within- and between-class weight matrix. In that way, each class has equal importance in LSDA's objective function. Experiments were carried out on the NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) extended condition 5 female task, results show that our proposed adaptive k nearest neighbors based LSDA method significantly improves the conventional i-vector/PLDA baseline by 18% relative cost reduction and 28% relative equal error rate reduction.",

      "abstract": "Researchers continue to be interested in efficient, accurate methods of estimating coefficients of covariates in mixture modeling. Including covariates related to the latent class analysis not only may improve the ability of the mixture model to clearly differentiate between subjects but also makes interpretation of latent group membership more meaningful. Very few studies have been conducted that compare the performance of various approaches to estimating covariate effects in mixture modeling, and fewer yet have considered more complicated models such as growth mixture models where the latent class variable is more difficult to identify. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to investigate the performance of four estimation approaches: (1) the conventional three-step approach, (2) the one-step maximum likelihood (ML) approach, (3) the pseudo class (PC) approach, and (4) the three-step ML approach in terms of their ability to recover covariate effects in the logistic regression class membership model within a growth mixture modeling framework. Results showed that when class separation was large, the one-step ML approach and the three-step ML approach displayed much less biased covariate effect estimates than either the conventional three-step approach or the PC approach. When class separation was poor, estimation of the relation between the dichotomous covariate and latent class variable was severely affected when the new three-step ML approach was used.",

      "abstract": "Many existing speaker verification systems are reported to be vulnerable against different spoofing attacks, for example speech synthesis, voice conversion, play back, etc. In order to detect these spoofed speech signals as a countermeasure, we propose a score level fusion approach with several different i-vector subsystems. We show that the acoustic level Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features, the phase level modified group delay cepstral coefficients (MGDCC) and the phonetic level phoneme posterior probability (PPP) tandem features are effective for the countermeasure. Furthermore, feature level fusion of these features before i-vector modeling also enhance the performance. A polynomial kernel support vector machine is adopted as the supervised classifier. In order to enhance the generalizability of the countermeasure, we also adopted the cosine similarity and PLDA scoring as one-class classifications methods. By combining the proposed i-vector subsystems with the OpenSMILE baseline which covers the acoustic and prosodic information further improves the final performance. The proposed fusion system achieves 0.29% and 3.26% EER on the development and test set of the database provided by the INTERSPEECH 2015 automatic speaker verification spoofing and countermeasures challenge.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an automatic non-native accent assessment approach using phonetic level posterior and duration features. In this method, instead of using conventional MFCC trained Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), we use phonetic phoneme states as tokens to calculate the posterior probability and zero-oder Baum-Welch statistics. Phoneme recognizers from five languages are employed to extract phonetic level features. It is shown that features based on these five languages' phoneme recognizers are complementary for capturing non-native information and phoneme duration based features are most effective in this task. The final proposed fusion system achieved 0.6089 Spearman's Correlation Coefficient on the test set, which outperformed the openSMILE baseline by 43.3%.",

Through establishing deep model, the probabilistic correlations of the visibilities are learned in different face local region. Firstly, face local regions are detected by part-based face detector. Secondly, the detection results are feed to deep model, which describes the correlations of different regions. Finally, the face detection is completed according to the correlations. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in the case of occlusion and multi-pose.",

A four-layer DNN is trained layer-by-layer from a cascade of Neural Networks (NNs) and two Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GBRBMs). The GBRBMs are adopted to model the distribution of spectral envelopes of the low frequency and the high frequency respectively. The NNs are used to model the joint distribution of hidden variables extracted from the two GBRBMs. The proposed method takes advantage of the strong modeling ability of GBRBMs in modeling the distribution of the spectral envelopes. And both the objective and subjective test results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional GMM based method.",

      "abstract": "To deal with the performance degradation of speaker recognition due to duration mismatch between enrollment and test utterances, a novel strategy to modify the standard normal prior distribution of the i-vector during probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) modeling is employed. This new modified-prior PLDA model incorporates the covariance matrix scaled with duration of each utterance for each speaker, which achieves more discriminative characteristics by learning the duration variability as well as session variation in the i-vector space. Furthermore, an efficient Quality Measure Function (QMF) method which adopts duration variation as a compensation technique is employed to eliminate the linear shift in the score domain. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on the NIST SRE10 core-core task in condition-5 with varying test utterance duration, in which the i-vectors of test utterances were extracted from full segment and randomly truncated segments of duration 10s and 20s. The results demonstrated the efficiency of modified-prior PLDA in different duration conditions, and the combined score calibration further improved the performance of speaker recognition.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a generalized i-vector representation framework using the mixture of Gaussian (MoG) factor analysis for speaker verification. Conventionally, a single standard factor analysis is adopted to generate a low rank total variability subspace where the mean supervector is assumed to be Gaussian distributed. The energy that can't be represented by the low rank space is modeled by a single multivariate Gaussian. However, due to the sparsity of the frame level posterior probability and the short duration characteristics, some dimensions of the first-order statistics may not be Gaussian distributed. Therefore, we replace the single Gaussian with a mixture of Gaussians to better represent the residual energy. Experimental results on the NIST SRE 2010 condition 5 female task and the RSR 2015 part 1 female task show that the MoG i-vector outperforms the i-vector baseline by more than 10% relatively for both text independent and text dependent speaker verification tasks, respectively.",

Different from traditional linear representation-based method, for every class, we develop a linear model representing a virtual sample as a linear representation of the class-specific training sample and the testing sample. In the model, the virtual sample is the mean value of the class-specific training samples, the testing sample can be considered as an increment and we define the coefficient associate with the testing sample as the increment coefficient. We employ the regularized least square method to solve the inverse problem and label the testing sample as the class which has the maximum increment coefficient. Experiments were made on the Yale and ORL face database. The performance of our method was demonstrated on two face databases and compared to the state-of-art with linear representation algorithms.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a generalized i-vector framework with phonetic tokenizations and tandem features for speaker verification as well as language identification. First, the tokens for calculating the zero-order statistics is extended from the MFCC trained Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) components to phonetic phonemes, 3-grams and tandem feature trained GMM components using phoneme posterior probabilities. Second, given the calculated zero-order statistics (posterior probabilities on tokens), the feature used to calculate the first-order statistics is also extended from MFCC to tandem features and is not necessarily the same feature employed by the tokenizer. Third, the zero-order and first-order statistics vectors are then concatenated and represented by the simplified supervised i-vector approach followed by the standard back end modeling methods. We study different system setups with different tokens and features. Finally, selected effective systems are fused at the score level to further improve the performance. Experimental results are reported on the NIST SRE 2010 common condition 5 female part task and the NIST LRE 2007 closed set 30 seconds task for speaker verification and language identification, respectively. The proposed generalized i-vector framework outperforms the i-vector baseline by relatively 45% in terms of equal error rate (EER) and norm minDCF values. Index Terms: speaker verification, language identification, generalized i-vector, phonetic tokenization, tandem feature",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an automatic speaker physical load recognition approach using posterior probability based features from acoustic and phonetic tokens. In this method, the tokens for calculating the posterior probability or zero-order statistics are extended from the conventional MFCC trained Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) components to parallel phonetic phonemes and tandem feature trained GMM components. Phoneme recognizers from five different languages are employed to extract the phoneme posterior probabilities. We show that these histogram style features at both the acoustic and phonetic levels are effective and complementary for capturing the speaker physical load information from short utterances. Support vector machine is adopted as the supervised classifier. By combining the proposed methods with the OpenSMILE baseline which covers the acoustic and prosodic information further improves the final performance. The proposed fusion system achieves 70.18% and 72.81% unweighted accuracy on the validation and test set of the Munich Bio-voice Corpus for the binary physical load level recognition task in the INTERSPEECH 2014 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge.",

In conventional speaker verification, Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) has been widely used as a supervised backend. However, PLDA requires fully labeled training data, which is often difficult to obtain in reality. To automatically retrieve the speaker labels of unlabeled training data, we propose to use the Affinity Propagation (AP) - a clustering method that takes pairwise data similarity as input - to generate the labels for the PLDA modeling. We further propose an iterative refinement strategy that incrementally updates the similarity input of the AP clustering with the previous iteration's PLDA scoring outputs. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of different PLDA scoring methods for the multiple enrollment task and show that the generalized hypothesis testing achieves the best results. Experiments were conducted on the NIST SRE 2010 and the 2014 i-vector challenge database. The results show that our proposed iterative and unsupervised PLDA model learning approach outperformed the cosine similarity baseline by 35% relatively.",

According to various information from the music signals, we use a pitch evolution model describing how pitch contour changes and an acoustic model representing the acoustic characteristics when the pitch is a hypothesized one, and obtain the optimal melody contour utilizing a Viterbi algorithm. The experimental results on the RWC popular music database indicate that the overall accuracy achieves 73.4%.",

The supervised i-vector is obtained by concatenating the label vector and the linear regression matrix at the end of the mean super-vector and the i-vector factor loading matrix, respectively. Different label vector designs are proposed to increase the robustness of the supervised i-vector models. Finally, Support Vector Regression (SVR) is deployed to estimate the age of the speakers. The proposed method outperforms the conventional i-vector baseline for speaker age estimation. A relative 2.4% decrease in Mean Absolute Error and 3.33% increase in correlation coefficient is achieved using supervised i-vector modeling using different label designs on the NIST SRE 2008 dataset male part.",

      "abstract": "Fuel sprays from outward-opening DISI engine injector were characterized under various fuel superheat degree (SD) conditions using laser sheet Mie-scattering and Phase Doppler Interferometer (PDI). N-hexane was used for a gasoline surrogate as it has a fixed boiling point and saturated vapor pressure. The macroscopic characteristics of the spray structure including the spray penetration and the spray angle, and the microscopic characteristics including Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) and size distributions of droplets, were investigated. The ratio of ambient pressure to saturation pressure (Pa/Ps) is used as an indicator of the SD. The results show that the spray structure deforms from an \"umbrella\" shape to a \"bell\" shape when SD increases from non-flash-boiling to full-flash-boiling area. And as Pa/Ps decreases (SD increases), the spray penetration decreases at first and turns to increase at about Pa/Ps = 0.3. The spray angle keeps relatively steady until Pa/Ps decreases to about 0.3, but significantly decreases when Pa/Ps <; 0.3, which corresponding to the flare flash boiling conditions. SMD and droplet size distributions also interpret a fact that increasing SD results in a better atomization of fuel spray.",

      "abstract": "Automatic language identification or detection of audio data has become an important preprocessing step for speech/speaker recognition and audio data mining. In many surveillance applications, language detection has to be performed on highly degraded audio inputs. In this paper, we present our work on language detection in highly degraded radio channel scenarios. We provide a brief description of the Targeted Robust Audio Processing (TRAP) language detection system builtfor the Phase II Evaluationof the RobustAutomatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) program. This system is a combination of 15 systems with different frontends and speech activity decisions. We also analyze the usefulness of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based non-linear projection of i-vectors before SVM classification. The proposed backend reduces the Equal Error Rate (EER) by 11%–25% relative compared to the baseline PCA-based feature representation for SVM classification, on the RATS test data consisting of data from eight highfrequency radio communication channels. Index Terms: Language identification (detection), highly degraded radio channel, RATS, i-vector, multi-layer perceptron.",

      "abstract": "We propose a practical, feature-level fusion approach for combining acoustic and articulatory information in speaker verification task. We find that concatenating articulation features obtained from the measured speech production data with conventional Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) improves the overall speaker verification performance. However, since access to the measured articulatory data is impractical for real world speaker verification applications, we also experiment with estimated articulatory features obtained using acoustic-to-articulatory inversion technique. Specifically, we show that augmenting MFCCs with articulatory features obtained from subject-independent acoustic-to-articulatory inversion technique also significantly enhances the speaker verification performance. This performance boost could be due to the information about inter-speaker variation present in the estimated articulatory features, especially at the mean and variance level. Experimental results on the Wisconsin X-Ray Microbeam database show that the proposed acoustic-estimatedarticulatory fusion approach significantly outperforms the traditional acoustic-only baseline, providing up to 10% relative reduction in Equal Error Rate (EER). We further show that we can achieve an additional 5% relative reduction in EER after score-level fusion.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a simplified and supervised i-vector modeling framework that is applied in the task of robust and efficient speaker verification (SRE). First, by concatenating the mean supervector and the i-vector factor loading matrix with respectively the label vector and the linear classifier matrix, the traditional i-vectors are then extended to label-regularized supervised i-vectors. These supervised i-vectors are optimized to not only reconstruct the mean supervectors well but also minimize the mean squared error between the original and the reconstructed label vectors, such that they become more discriminative. Second, factor analysis (FA) can be performed on the pre-normalized centered GMM first order statistics supervector to ensure that the Gaussian statistics sub-vector of each Gaussian component is treated equally in the FA, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Experimental results are reported on the female part of the NIST SRE 2010 task with common condition 5. The proposed supervised i-vector approach outperforms the i-vector baseline by relatively 12% and 7% in terms of equal error rate (EER) and norm old minDCF values, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Language-independent embedded speech recognition is a necessary and important application. Considering personal privacy, collection difficulty of all the reference words, and limited storage space of mobile devices, language-independent (LI) embedded speech recognition should be classified into lightweight speaker-dependent (SD) cases. Dynamic time warping (DTW) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for small foot-print SD automatic speech recognition. To decrease the high computational complexity of DTW, and to avoid constraints-induced coarse approximation and inaccuracy problems, we introduce a novel confidence index dynamic time warping (CIDTW) approach. CIDTW defines a new cost function, called the confidence index cost function (CICF), to measure the similarity between merged speech training and testing data, while follows the same DTW process. With extensive experiments on three representative SD datasets, CIDTW achieves better accuracy and overall six times faster speeds compared with DTW.",

The binocular vision system could provide more information of monitored targets and has unique advantages in analysis of suspicious targets and understanding of images. Currently, the research and application of the binocular vision system has been widely concerned by domestic and foreign researchers. Moving target detection is developing and innovating as the primary problem in the most visual system. In this paper, three classic algorithms of moving target detection have been introduced: background difference method, frame difference method and optical flow method. After compassion and analysis of the three algorithms through the experiment, the study concludes that the background difference method based on the mixed Gaussian model has some advantages in binocular vision system.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Lasso based framework to generate the sparse total variability supervectors (s-vectors). Rather than the factor analysis framework, which uses a low dimensional Eigenvoice subspace to represent the mean supervector, the proposed Lasso approach utilizes the l1 norm regularized least square estimation to project the mean supervector on a pre-defined dictionary. The number of samples in this dictionary is appreciably larger than the typical Eigenvoice rank but the l1 norm of the Lasso solution vector is constrained. Only a small number of samples in the dictionary are selected for representing the mean supervector, and most of the dictionary coefficients in the Lasso solution are 0. We denote these sparse dictionary coefficient vectors in the Lasso solutions as the s-vectors and model them using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) for speaker verification. The proposed approach generates comparable results to the conventional cosine distance scoring based i-vector system and improvement is achieved by fusing the proposed method with either the i-vector system or the joint factor analysis (JFA) system. Experiments results are reported on the female part of the NIST SRE 2010 task with common condition 5 using equal error rate (EER), norm old minDCF and norm new minDCF values. The norm new minDCF cost was reduced by 7.5% and 9.6% relative when fusing the proposed approach with the baseline JFA and i-vector systems, respectively. Similarly, 8.3% and 10.7% relative norm old minDCF cost reduction was observed in the fusion. 1",

      "abstract": "The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) based on human auditory characteristics are widely used for audio recognition. However, the performance of MFCC-based audio recognition degrades due to noise interference. In consideration of this, we propose the matching pursuit (MP) sparse representation algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) improved by elite strategy and evolution reversal to accomplish the task of filtering out extraneous noise. In the first step, MP is carried out to represent the ecological environmental signal's inner structure. The second step consists of MFCCs feature extraction. Finally, two different classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) were performed and compared using the proposed features. Experimental results showed that the SVM-based classifier outperforms the GMM classifier and indicated that this method with sparse representation achieved improved performance in noisy environments.",

Then an NDRC framework based on two-way communication, which outlines the primary elements as stakeholders, messages, platforms, and settings, is proposed and formulated. Finally, the targets and challenges of researches and practices on NDRC are attempted to list and outline.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an automatic speaker state recognition approach which models the factor vectors in the latent factor analysis framework improving upon the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) baseline performance. We investigate both intoxicated and affective speaker states. We consider the affective speech signal as the original normal average speech signal being corrupted by the affective channel effects. Rather than reducing the channel variability to enhance the robustness as in the speaker verification task, we directly model the speaker state on the channel factors under the factor analysis framework. In this work, the speaker state factor vectors are extracted and modeled by the latent factor analysis approach in the GMM modeling framework and support vector machine classification method. Experimental results show that the proposed speaker state factor vector modeling system achieved 5.34% and 1.49% unweighted accuracy improvement over the GMM baseline on the intoxicated speech detection task (Alcohol Language Corpus) and the emotion recognition task (IEMOCAP database), respectively.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the sparse representation computed by lminimization with quadratic constraints is employed to model the i-vectors in the low dimensional total variability space after performing the Within-Class Covariance Normalization and Linear Discriminate Analysis channel compensation. First, we propose the background normalized l residual as a scoring criterion. Second, we demonstrate that the Tnorm can be efficiently achieved by using the Tnorm data as the non-target samples in the over-complete dictionary. Finally, by fusing with the conventional i-vector based support vector machine (SVM) and cosine distance scoring system, we demonstrate overall system performance improvement. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion system achieved 4.05% (male) and 5.25% (female) equal error rate (EER) after Tnorm on the single-single multi-language handheld telephone task of NIST SRE 2008 and outperformed the SVM baseline by yielding 7.1% and 4.9% relative EER reduction for the male and female tasks, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Speaker state recognition is a challenging problem due to speaker and context variability. Intoxication detection is an important area of paralinguistic speech research with potential real-world applications. In this work, we build upon a base set of various static acoustic features by proposing the combination of several different methods for this learning task. The methods include extracting hierarchical acoustic features, performing iterative speaker normalization, and using a set of GMM supervectors. We obtain an optimal unweighted recall for intoxication recognition using score-level fusion of these subsystems. Unweighted average recall performance is 70.54% on the test set, an improvement of 4.64% absolute (7.04% relative) over the baseline model accuracy of 65.9%. Index Terms: intoxication detection, speaker state, hierarchical features, speaker normalization, GMM supervectors",

The regional science and technology policy of the EU is closely related to the regional policy of the EU and it has played very important role in solving the regional problems of the economic recession regions in the EU. The successful experience of the EU is very useful for the revitalization of the Chinese industrial structural readjustment regions, such as the North-eastern and Central areas of China, which are similar with the economic recession regions of the EU. With complete legal document, sound policy instrument and scientific capital management, the regional science and technology policy of China can be expected to play a more important role in solving the current regional problems of China.",

      "abstract": "It has been previously demonstrated that systems based on block wise local features and Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are suitable for video based talking face verification due to the best trade-off in terms of complexity, robustness and performance. In this paper, we propose two methods to enhance the robustness and performance of the GMM-ZTnorm baseline system. First, joint factor analysis is performed to compensate the session variabilities due to different recording devices, lighting conditions, facial expressions, etc. Second, the difference between the universal background model (UBM) and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) adapted model is mapped into the GMM mean shifted supervector whose over-complete dictionary becomes more incoherent. Then, for verification purpose, the sparse representation computed by l <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> -minimization with quadratic constraints is employed to model these GMM mean shifted supervectors. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieved 8.4% (group 1) and 10.5% (group 2) equal error rate on the Banca talking face video database following the P protocol and outperformed the GMM-ZTnorm baseline by yielding more than 20% relative error reduction.",

      "abstract": "Gaussian Mixture Regression has been shown to be a powerful and easy-to-tune regression technique for imitation learning of constrained motor tasks in robots.Yet, current formulations are not suited when one wants a robot to learn incrementally and online a variety of new contextdependant tasks whose number and complexity is not known at programming time, and when the demonstrator is not allowed to tell the system when he introduces a new task (but rather the system should infer this from the continuous sensorimotor context).In this paper, we show that this limitation can be addressed by introducing an Incremental, Local and Online variation of Gaussian Mixture Regression (ILO-GMR) which successfully allows a simulated robot to learn incrementally and online new motor tasks through modelling them locally as dynamical systems, and able to use the sensorimotor context to cope with the absence of categorical information both during demonstrations and when a reproduction is asked to the system.Moreover, we integrate a complementary statistical technique which allows the system to incrementally learn various tasks which can be intrinsically defined in different frames of reference, which we call framings, without the need to tell the system which particular framing should be used for each task: this is inferred automatically by the system.",

This paper presents a variation on the traditional PSO algorithms, called improved cooperative particle swarm optimization, or COPSO, employing cooperative behavior to significantly improve the performance of the original algorithms. Firstly, traditional PSO algorithms were used to update the position and velocity vectors of particles, and then a reference global best position was obtained by using cooperative operator on the best positions of particles encountered so far. Such reference global best position was used to update the current global best position of the swarm, which was calculated by above traditional PSO algorithms. Application of the COPSO algorithm on there benchmark optimization problems showed a marked improvement in convergence rate over some traditional PSO algorithms.",

Channel modulation effects are supposed to be weakened in the harmonic structure features, and furthermore the influence introduced by channel variability could be diminished to a certain degree. Though experiment results show that the raw performance of the harmonic structure features is not better than our baseline system due to some inevitable information lost, significant improvement of average 9.85% relative minCost decrease has been made by a score fusion approach with baseline features.",

      "abstract": "An algorithm for text detection in images from street view, basing on Haar-like features and AdaBoost classification is proposed in this paper. The idea is intended for searching a wanted place in a foreign city with the business name, the scene text and the street address. There are two contributions in this paper. First the difficulty of locating the specified buildings exactly in an unfamiliar city is analyzed, and then a novel application associated with a mapping application to the real view of target place is presented in this paper. Another is training a cascade AdaBoost classifier using several weak classifiers with Haar-like features, which examined our approach. The feasibility of proposed application has been evaluated using 216 training samples and 128 testing samples captured by ourselves in street view. The overall performance of our experiment is improved, a precision of 72.6% and a recall of 79.9%.",

Several acoustic parameters and their combination features are investigated to find objective correspondences of the perceptual evaluation criteria. Experimental results show relative strong correlation between perceptual ratings and the combined features and the reliability of the proposed evaluation system is tested to be comparable to human judges.",

And it cannot realize the relationship labeling with more fine structure between semantic roles. An approach to semantic role labeling (SRL) based on chain conditional random fields (CCRFs) model was proposed. The long-distance dependencies between different state variants were handled effectively via labeling hierarchical dependencies and brother dependencies of syntactic dependency tree. Moreover, some new combinative features and prepositional phrase also were added though taking advantages of any features can be added in CRFs model. The experiments were implemented on CoNLL 2008 Shared Task. The results indicate the proposed method can improve precision and recall rate of the system.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a generative model-based approach for audio-visual event classification. This approach is based on a new unsupervised learning method using an extended probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) model. We represent each video clip as a collection of spatial-temporal-audio words, which are generated by fusing the visual and audio features using the pLSA model. Each audio-visual event class is treated as the latent topic in this model. The probability distributions of the spatial-temporal-audio words are learnt from training examples, which include a sequence of videos that represent different types of audio-visual events. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

However, the standard KCCA algorithm may suffer from computational problem as the training set increase. To overcome the drawback, we propose a three-stage method to improve the performance of KCCA. Firstly, a scheme based on geometrical consideration is proposed to enhance the extraction efficiency. The algorithm can select a subset of samples whose projections in feature space (Hilbert space) are sufficient to represent all of the data in feature space. Subsequently, an improved algorithm inspired by principal component analysis (PCA) is developed. The algorithm can select the most contributive eigenvectors for training and classification instead of considering all the ones. Finally, a multi-class classification method based on support vectors data description (SVDD) is employed to further enhance the recognition performance as it can avoid the repeated use of training data. The theoretical analysis and the experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of improvements.",

Then the outputs determine the next strategy that the agent will choose. The weight values are updated by particle swarm optimization algorithm. The multi-agent decision model is applied in public goods games, and numerical results show that this decision model has the ability of adaptive learning and can prevent the collision between agents to realize the total social utility maximum.",

Firstly, we gota coarse decision by a fast scan all registered speakers using PCA classifier to find R possible target speakers, and then KFD classifier was used to make final decision. PCA also has another advantage: reduction of the feature vectors dimensions, and the noise is removed from speech simultaneity. So, it can reduce the computational complexity and improve the performance of speaker verification. KFD classifier achieved high verification accuracy since it utilized all training samples. The experiment results showed that the proposed method could improve recognition accuracy of system remarkably and the system has better robustness by comparing with the traditional speaker verification method.",

However, Extractive feature vectors from the speech are overlapped and noisy is included in the original data space, these problems can lead to experience difficulties, training complication during training SVM, and the result will be reduced during the recognition phase. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to reduce the noise and input vectors of the SVM. Firstly data dimensions are reduced and noise is removed by using PCA transform, secondly feature data are selected at boundary of each cluster as SVs by using Kernel-based fuzzy clustering technique. The training data, time and storage can be reduced remarkably compared with traditional SVM; the speaker identification system based on our proposed reduced support vector machine (RSVM) has better robustness compared with other reduced algorithms.",

In this paper, in order to compensate the distortions due to inter-speaker variability within the same language and solve the practical limitation of computer memory requested by large database training, multiple speaker group based discriminative classifiers are employed to map the cepstral features of speech utterances into discriminative language characterization score vectors (DLCSV). Furthermore, backend SVM classifiers are used to model the probability distribution of each target language in the DLCSV space and the output scores of backend classifiers are calibrated as the final language recognition scores by a pair-wise posterior probability estimation algorithm. The proposed SVM framework is evaluated on 2003 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation databases, achieving an equal error rate of 4.0% in 30-second tasks, which outperformed the state-of-art SVM system by more than 30% relative error reduction.",

This paper puts forward an automatic quality control (AQC) strategy for it. Firstly, this paper discusses the principle of AQC, then, develops some methods for it, including automatic algorithms for error detecting, constraint and compensation, and an AQC management system. Finally, the authors cite several international joint projects to prove the validity and feasibility of this strategy.",

In this paper, spatial information multi-grid (SIMG) is presented to institute a uniformed, rigorous, and continuous national spatial information infrastructure for national service. Firstly, its fundamental theories and key technologies are brief introduced. Then, this paper discusses its theoretical framework, notional model, data structure and relative methods designed for service. At last, a prototype system is cited to verify its feasibility and validity.",

A variety of features and their combinations extracted by language dependent recognizers were evaluated based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) 2003 corpus. Three well-known classifiers: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and feed forward neural network (NN) are proposed to compartmentalize these high level features which are generated by n-gram language model scoring and one pass decoding based on acoustic model in PPRLM system. Finally, the log-likelihood radio (LLR) normalization is applied to backend processing to the target language scores and the performance of language recognition is enhanced.",

However, training SVM consumes long computing time and large memory with all training data. This paper proposes a speaker identification method based on multi- reduced support vector machine (MRSVM). MRSVM has two reduction steps. Firstly, speech feature dimensions are reduced by using KL transform, the noise is removed from speech simultaneity. Secondly, speech feature data are selected at boundary of each cluster as SVs by using kernel-based fuzzy clustering technique. Experiment results show that not only the training data, training time and storage can be reduced remarkably, but also the identification accuracy can be improved by the proposed MRSVM compared with other reduced algorithms and the system has better robustness.",

This paper provides one potential solution to this problem. A method named Individual Discriminative Subspace (IDS) is proposed for robust face recognition under uncontrolled conditions. IDS is the subspace where only the images from one particular person converge around the origin while those from others scatter. Each IDS can be used to distinguish one individual from others. There is no restriction on the face images fed into the algorithm, which makes it practical for real-life applications. In the experiments, IDS is tested on two large face databases with extensive variations and performs significantly better than 12 existing FR techniques.",

Based on the measurement results of XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) as reference, a correlation study was taken between XPS and AES (Auger electron spectroscopy) data in this paper. The study shows that, by optimizing the experiment conditions of AES such as beam energy, beam current and take off angle, and introducing proper corrective factor, AES can be used as a useful and reliable characterization tool during the monitoring measurement of Nitrogen concentration in ultra thin (&amp;lt;2nm) nitrided silicon gate oxide.",

      "abstract": "The problem of finding a center string that is `close' to every given string arises and has many applications in computational biology and coding theory. This problem has two versions: the Closest String problem and the Closest Substring problem. Assume that we are given a set of strings ${\\cal S}=\\{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\\}$ of strings, say, each of length $m$. The Closest String problem asks for the smallest $d$ and a string $s$ of length $m$ which is within Hamming distance $d$ to each $s_i\\in {\\cal S}$. This problem comes from coding theory when we are looking for a code not too far away from a given set of codes. The problem is NP-hard. Berman et al give a polynomial time algorithm for constant $d$. For super-logarithmic $d$, Ben-Dor et al give an efficient approximation algorithm using linear program relaxation technique. The best polynomial time approximation has ratio 4/3 for all $d$ given by Lanctot et al and Gasieniec et al. The Closest Substring problem looks for a string $t$ which is within Hamming distance $d$ away from a substring of each $s_i$. This problem only has a $2- \\frac{2}{2|Σ|+1}$ approximation algorithm previously Lanctot et al and is much more elusive than the Closest String problem, but it has many applications in finding conserved regions, genetic drug target identification, and genetic probes in molecular biology. Whether there are efficient approximation algorithms for both problems are major open questions in this area. We present two polynomial time approxmation algorithms with approximation ratio $1+ ε$ for any small $ε$ to settle both questions.",

      "abstract": "The conventional color edge detection methods generate color edge maps by calculating the vector gradient at each pixel. These methods may cause false edge detection for color stripe images and other special color images and they are sensitivity to noise. A new vector template matching method based on pyramid structure is presented. It can generate more precise edge points. The pyramid image structure has been used to reduce the computational cost in the multiresolution analysis. The effect of Gaussian noise can be reduced by selecting a suitable weighting function in the color pyramid generation. The edge interpolation, adjustment and smoothing are carried out to obtain edge map of a lower pyramid level from the edge map immediately above by the top-down strategy. The vector average median filtering is applied in this procedure to reduce the effect of impulsive noise. The method is applied to color palm images and another special images with both Gaussian and impulsive noise. Good edge maps are obtained from ex- periments. © 1997 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers. (S0091-3286(97)02105-3)",
