A strong longitudinal thread is the use of EEG and multimodal physiological signals (fMRI, structural MRI, autonomic markers) to develop robust, cross-subject, distributionally invariant classifiers for depression, schizophrenia, and emotional dysregulation. Recent work increasingly emphasizes causal disentanglement, dynamic functional connectivity, neuromodulation (taVNS), and brain-inspired AI (e.g., SNNs), reflecting a maturing focus on mechanism-aware, deployable tools for real-world mental healthcare.",

      "abstract": "Vigilance estimation is a critical task within the field of brain-computer interfaces, extensively applied in monitoring and optimizing user states during human-machine interaction using electroencephalography (EEG). However, most existing vigilance prediction frameworks are prone to spurious correlations stemming from inherent biases in collected data. These biases involve relevant but vigilance-independent information, which may lack robustness when applied to different data distributions, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The core idea of this study is to learn constraints that capture causal information from the input based on the assumed underlying data generating process. Leveraging the disentanglement and invariance principles behind the assumptions, we propose a constraint-driven causal representation learning (CCRL) to identify and separate spurious latent variables from biased training data for generalized vigilance estimation. The CCRL training process consists of two phases: self-supervised pretraining and constraint-driven causal information disentanglement. In the first phase, based on the masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture, unlabeled training data are used for reconstructing pretext tasks to capture the comprehensive and intrinsic contextual information from EEG data, which provides a powerful input for downstream disentanglement learning. In the second phase, we propose a novel disentanglement strategy to learn spurious-free latent representations causally related to the vigilance state driven by adversarial and invariance constraints. Comprehensive validation experiments conducted on two well-known public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework. In general, this work has promising implications for addressing OOD challenges in vigilance estimation.",

      "abstract": "Functional brain network modeling plays a crucial role in uncovering cognitive mechanisms and identifying abnormalities associated with brain disorders. However, traditional approaches—such as Pearson correlation and mutual information—typically assume that interregional relationships are static and linear, limiting their ability to capture dynamic interactions and nonlinear features. To address this limitation, we propose a nonlinear dynamic low-rank representation method. This approach constructs interregional similarity weights using physiological state matrices and Frobenius distance, while incorporating neighborhood information to generate a row-stochastic transition matrix, thereby enhancing the robustness of local connections. Additionally, a dynamic interaction effect matrix is constructed based on the stationary distribution eigenvectors, enabling the identification of both direct and indirect information transmission processes between brain regions. The method preserves the brain’s modular structure through low-rank representation and manifold regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively reveals dynamic information transmission pathways, cross-modular cooperative effects, and task-dependent hub reorganization patterns, but also significantly outperforms traditional static connectivity approaches. This study offers a mathematically rigorous and physiologically interpretable framework for dynamic brain network modeling and lays a theoretical foundation for the detection of dynamic abnormalities in mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Emotion inhibitory control is a key executive function of the human brain, which regulates behavior by suppressing inappropriate responses. It plays an integral part in alleviating negative emotions, improving mood, and preventing depression. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proved to enhance behavioral control, potentially suppressing negative emotions or facilitating their reduction in healthy individuals. However, the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying taVNS-induced neuroenhancement remain unclear. In this work, a portable electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and stimulation device is designed to collect eight-channel EEG signals and deliver taVNS to both sides of ears. Then, we design a protocol that successfully induced negative emotions in healthy subjects. Next, we conduct a sham-controlled experiment, involving 28 healthy subjects, to explore the changes in EEG of negative emotions under taVNS. Finally, we primarily analyze the power spectrum density (PSD) of EEG signals and the functional connectivity network of the brain, based on the phase locking value (PLV), to assess the effect of taVNS on neural activity induced by negative emotions. The results of the experiment reveal that taVNS is a promising method for enhancing emotional inhibitory control by reducing PSD in the alpha band and enhancing PLV within prefrontal inhibitory control networks. In addition, differences in graph theory parameters between the Sham and taVNS conditions indicate that taVNS helps regulate negative emotions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that taVNS enhances inhibitory control and reveals its neurocomputational mechanisms of EEG in healthy individuals during the development of negative emotions. And results indicate that taVNS could serve as a promising neuromodulation therapy for psychiatric disorders and individuals with depression or emotional distress.",

The physical random code signal with the natural random and aperiodicity is used as the radar-transmitted waveform. A series of slow time-Doppler frequency (ST-DF) images are obtained by correlation ranging and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for echo and reference signals, and then are arranged at different ranges to obtain the 3-D range-time–frequency matrix. The range-time–frequency points are input into the improved PointConv network after the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection, isosurface mesh generation (IMG), and farthest point sampling (FPS) for the 3-D matrix. The PointConv network is improved by model simplification and structural enhancement, which can achieve higher recognition accuracy, the smaller parameters with 5.53 M, and the smaller floating-point operations (FLOPs) of 1.06 G, compared to the existing PointConv network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed radar can accurately recognize human actions behind walls with a 99.63% average accuracy for ten actions and a 96.83% average accuracy for six participants. Compared with the 2-D image-based convolutional neural network, three-domain feature fusion, two 3-D point-based PointNet networks, and 3-D point-based PointConv network, the proposed method realizes the higher recognition accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Constrained decoding approaches aim to control the meaning or style of text generated by a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for various task-specific objectives at inference time. However, these methods often guide plausible continuations by greedily and explicitly selecting targets, which, while fulfilling the task requirements, may overlook the natural patterns of human language generation. In this work, we propose a novel decoding framework, <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Decider</small>, which enables us to program high-level rules on how we might effectively complete tasks to control a PLM. Differing from previous works, our framework transforms the encouragement of concrete target words into the encouragement of all words that satisfy the high-level rules. Specifically, <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Decider</small> is a dual system in which a PLM is equipped and controlled by a First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoner to express and evaluate the rules, along with a decision function that merges the outputs from both systems to guide the generation. Experiments on CommonGen and PersonaChat demonstrate that <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Decider</small> can effectively follow given rules to guide a PLM in achieving generation tasks in a more human-like manner.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have long sought objective and quantifiable methods for recognizing depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which reflect brain activities objectively, have emerged as a promising tool for this purpose. However, the practical application of EEG signals faces significant challenges arising from distribution variability across different datasets and subjects. In addition, conventional methods often struggle to effectively capture information related to dynamic transformations in distributions. To address these issues, we propose a Wasserstein distribution-inspired dynamic adversarial network (WDANet) for EEG-based depression recognition. Specifically, WDANet includes a global discriminator that focuses on the marginal distribution of EEG features, a local discriminator that concentrates on the conditional distribution of EEG features, and a Wasserstein distribution discriminator that utilizes Wasserstein distributions derived from various processed EEG features. The experimental results show that WDANet achieved classification accuracies of 83.33%, 75.52%, 73.93%, 76.04%, and 70.94% in cross-subject, cross-dataset experiments conducted on three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods. These results support our claim that WDANet enhances the accuracy and interpretability of depression recognition, providing insights and new research directions for the integration of neuroscience and artificial intelligence technologies.",

      "abstract": "Event-driven neuromorphic computing involves sparse and asynchronous signal activity, which leads to irregular computation patterns and fine-grained concurrency. As a result, processing architectures need to support both high parallelism and energy efficiency. Among existing architectural solutions, superscalar designs exhibit significant potential for addressing high parallelism demands. However, conventional superscalar processors, which rely on synchronous circuits, maintain high-frequency clocking at all times, leading to substantial power inefficiency in sparse computation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose an asynchronous superscalar architecture that replaces global clocking with fully local handshake-based control, implemented using a bundled-data asynchronous protocol. The design supports decoding of up to 64 scalar instructions per cycle and implements the RISC-V RV32IMC instruction set. A prototype was fabricated using a 110 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process and was evaluated through post-layout simulation. Operating at 1.2 V, the processor delivers a peak INT8 throughput of 669.4 GOPS, with a static power consumption of 421 mW.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, cognitive impairments, and social withdrawal. It leads to a series of brain abnormalities, particularly the deformation of the hippocampus and amygdala, which are highly associated with emotion, memory, and motivation. Most previous studies have used the hippocampal and amygdaloid volume, whereas surface-based morphometry reflects nuclear deformation more finely, but it is unclear the hippocampal and amygdaloid morphometry relates to schizophrenic pathology and its potential as a biomarker. In this study, we extracted individual multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) of hippocampus and amygdala from MRI images and analyzed the morphometric differences between groups. After dictionary learning and max pooling, we obtain reduced dimensional features and use machine learning algorithms for individual diagnosis. The results showed that the hippocampus of the schizophrenia group was significantly atrophied bilaterally and the atrophied areas were symmetrical. Subregions of the amygdala are both atrophied and expanded, and in particular, the right amygdala shows a greater degree and extent of deformation. Using the random forest classifier, the accuracy of classification using hippocampal and amygdaloid morphometric features are 94.52% and 94.57%, respectively, and the accuracy of classification combining the two morphometric features reached 96.57%. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of MMS in identifying morphometric differences of the hippocampus and amygdala between healthy controls and schizophrenic, and these findings emphasize the potential of MMS as a reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Based on available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, hippocampal alteration is one of the hallmarks during cognitive decline. However, the longitudinal hippocampal morphometric changes during the initial cognitive decline are unclear. Exploring a validated biomarker with high clinical relevance is urgent. This work proposed an automated MRI-driven longitudinal hippocampal alteration analysis system (LHAAS), which consists of hippocampal segmentation, reconstruction, registration, multivariate morphometric feature extraction, and longitudinal analysis of hippocampal morphometric and volumetric differences between groups. LHAAS was applied on two groups: cognitive unimpaired (CU) participants who maintained cognitive unimpaired (non-Progressors), and participants who converted to MCI during the following four years (Progressors). LHAAS can detect and visualize subtle deformations in the bilateral hippocampus of CU progressors four years before they show initial cognitive decline. For CU progressors, hippocampal atrophy initially occurs at the CA1 subregion and then along with disease progression, spreading to the CA2-3 and Subiculum subregion, exhibiting a left-greater-than-right trend. The volumetric analyses showed similar results. Besides, hippocampal subregions highly correlated with clinical measurement were identified by correlation analysis. LHAAS can accurately reflect the small hippocampal subregional atrophy at preclinical AD. This proposed system can track the longitudinal hippocampal alterations in the early stages of AD and provide insights for early intervention. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: LHAAS offers early detection of subtle hippocampal alterations at preclinical AD. This advance enables pathological research and timely interventions to potentially improve patient outcomes in clinical implementation.",

      "abstract": "Emotions regulation play an important role in human behavior, but exhibit considerable heterogeneity among individuals, which attenuates the generalization ability of emotion models. In this work, we aim to achieve robust emotion prediction through efficient disentanglement of affective semantic representations. In detail, the data generation mechanism behind observations from different perspectives is causally set, where latent variables that relate to emotion are explicitly separate into three parts: the intrinsic-related part, the extrinsic-related part, and the spurious-related part. Affective semantic features consist of the first two parts, with the understanding that spurious latent variables generate the inherent biases in the data. Furthermore, a variational autoencoder with a reformulated objective function is proposed to learn such disentangled latent variables, and only adopts semantic representations to perform the final classification task, avoiding the interference of spurious variables. In addition, for electroencephalography (EEG) data used in this article, a space-frequency mapping method is introduced to improve information utilization. Comprehensive experiments on popular emotion datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive intersubject generalization performance. Our results highlight the potential of efficient latent representation disentanglement in addressing the complexity challenges of emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), as a method for mimicking VNS, has been proven effective in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, the underlying mechanism through which taVNS mimics VNS remains elusive. Moreover, the parameters of taVNS are singularly fixed and open loop in previous work, which is difficult to apply to all users as individual differences are inevitable. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the important biomarkers of neural activity, this study aims to develop a closed-loop system for personalized interventions in emotion regulation by integrating taVNS with EEG feedback. We first design a taVNS system based on EEG signal feedback and verify the performance metrics of the system. Second, we design experimental paradigms to explore the changes in EEG features under the taVNS. The experimental results show that the EEG characteristics differ between different taVNS frequencies (between 50 and 100 Hz). Moreover, we observe substantial distinctions between EEG characteristics during the taVNS state and the resting state, with pre-taVNS, taVNS, and post-taVNS exhibiting notable differences. Specifically, the power spectral density (PSD) in the taVNS state is lower than in the resting state (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${p} \\lt {0.05}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), except for the beta band where the opposite trend is observed. Additionally, features such as Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) and Reyi entropy (REn) displayed a decreasing trend throughout the taVNS (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${p} \\lt {0.05}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Furthermore, we employ hidden Markov models (HMMs) to reveal the heterogeneity of dynamic changes in the brain during taVNS, providing a mechanistic interpretation of taVNS.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with multimodal physiological signals represents a pivotal approach to detect affective disorders (ADs). With the increasing complexity and diversity of physiological signal modalities, researchers have introduced various AI methods using multimodal physiological signals to improve model classification performance and explainability to increase trust and facilitate clinical adoption. Among these methods, spiking neural networks (SNNs) stand out as a promising avenue due to their alignment with the operating principles of the human brain, robust biological explainability, and adeptness in processing spatial–temporal information in an efficient event-driven manner with low power consumption. Furthermore, the emergence of neuromorphic computing (NC) chips based on SNNs has greatly bolstered the field of NC, enabling effective support for objective, pervasive, and wearable AI-assisted medical diagnostic devices for ADs and other diseases. This article presents a review of recent achievements in multimodal AD detection and points out the associated challenges in utilizing multimodal physiological signals and NC based on SNNs for AD detection. Building upon this foundation, we give perspectives on future work. The intended readership for this review consists of researchers in the fields of cognitive computing, computational psychophysiology, affective computing, NC, and brain-inspired computing. We hope that this survey not only garners increased attention from the scientific community but also serves as a valuable guide for future studies in this field.",

      "abstract": "Many headache patients often report cognitive disturbances, but tactile cognitive data are limited. Applying computing-aided strategies to reveal the association between migraine without aura (MOA) or tension-type headache (TTH) and tactile cognition is one of the research highlights. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MOA or TTH patients had a decline in tactile discrimination by utilizing a tactile angle discrimination tester. A cross-sectional study was performed between 1 January 2021, and 1 January 2022. A total of 301 participants were enrolled, with 107 in control, 90 in MOA, and 104 in TTH groups. A tactile cognition tester was used to objectively examine tactile discrimination in all participants. Tactile angle discrimination thresholds were measured to compare tactile cognitive functions among three groups. There were no statistically significant differences in their demographic characteristics. Compared to the normal control group, the MOA and TTH groups exhibited significantly higher tactile angle discrimination thresholds (showing decline in tactile discrimination), whereas no significant differences were found between the MOA and TTH groups. Differences in tactile angle discrimination thresholds were observed between young (≤ 44 years old) and middle-aged/elderly (≥ 45 years old) participants in the normal control group but not in the MOA and TTH groups. Moreover, the tactile deficits shown in the MOA or TTH groups were evident only in young participants. This study first demonstrated that patients with MOA or TTH, especially those patients younger than 44 years old, had decreased tactile angle discrimination ability, suggesting decline of tactile cognition.",

      "abstract": "As an essential challenge within the realm of affective computing, emotion recognition assumes a vital role in bestowing computers with a higher level and comprehensive intelligence. Furthermore, it has emerged as a crucial research topic in both human–computer interaction (HCI) and medical rehabilitation related to mental illnesses. However, the related fusion studies for modeling physiological signals in emotion recognition are less based on multimodal coordinated representation and lack the exploration of multimodal physiological signal correlation. In this article, we propose a tensor correlation fusion framework for emotion recognition based on multimodal physiological signals. After extracting effective features from various physiological signals, the coordinated representation module of the framework first simultaneously learns the linear correlation of all input physiological signals based on the covariance tensor. An optimized solution strategy is constructed to obtain the coordinated representation corresponding to each physiological signal. Finally, an emotion recognition module fuses the correlation information of the coordinated representation of different physiological signals as input to the emotion recognition classifier. This framework constructs coordinated representation by introducing a strategy to simultaneously capture the correlation among multiple physiological signals, providing a fresh perspective with a well-defined mathematical foundation for the fusion of multimodal physiological signals in the realm of emotion recognition. The experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate that compared with related methods, the framework achieves relatively higher emotion recognition performance while obtaining a coordinated representation of multimodal physiological signal correlations of emotions, all while achieving superior processing speed.",

      "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) network derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been extensively employed in the automated identification of brain disorders. Conventional FC network modeling methods typically assign equal importance to different sampling points of rs-fMRI and brain regions of interest (ROIs). Nevertheless, considering temporal and regional heterogeneity, this assumption may not always be applicable. Moreover, sparse regression algorithms with regularization terms are commonly adopted to eliminate spurious FC. However, these conventional regularization terms impose a uniform sparse penalty on all FC without considering the prior knowledge that the brain tends to transmit information in an energetically efficient manner. To address the above problems, we propose an adaptive weight and Wasserstein distance constrained low-rank sparse representation (AW-WD-LSR) method to construct FC networks. Specifically, we employ adaptive weights to the reconstruction errors of rs-fMRI time series across various ROIs and sampling points, thereby amplifying the significance of crucial features in the joint representation, leading to a more robust FC network. Meanwhile, we incorporate a local constraint by introducing the optimal transport distance (i.e., Wasserstein distance) between ROIs to adjust the sparse penalty on the corresponding FC. The larger Wasserstein distance, the higher information transmission cost between two ROIs, resulting in a greater penalty imposed on the corresponding FC. The efficacy of the innovation modules is demonstrated in classification tasks involving major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features (MMF), MDD without mixed features (MDD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">noMF</sub>), and healthy controls (HCs).",

      "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) networks, built from analyses of resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), serve as efficacious biomarkers for identifying Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) patients. Given the neurobiological heterogeneity across individuals and the unique presentation of ASD symptoms, the fusion of individualized information into diagnosis becomes essential. However, this aspect is overlooked in most methods. Furthermore, the existing methods typically focus on studying direct pairwise connections between brain ROIs, while disregarding interactions between indirectly connected neighbors. To overcome above challenges, we build common FC and individualized FC by tangent pearson embedding (TP) and common orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) respectively, and present a novel multiview brain transformer (MBT) aimed at effectively fusing common and indivinformation of subjects. MBT is mainly constructed by transformer layers with diffusion kernel (DK), fusion quality-inspired weighting module (FQW), similarity loss and orthonormal clustering fusion readout module (OCFRead). DK transformer can incorporate higher-order random walk methods to capture wider interactions among indirectly connected brain regions. FQW promotes adaptive fusion of features between views, and similarity loss and OCFRead are placed on the last layer to accomplish the ultimate integration of information. In our method, TP, DK and FQW modules all help to model wider connectivity in the brain that make up for the shortcomings of traditional methods. We conducted experiments on the public ABIDE dataset based on AAL and CC200 respectively. Our framework has shown promising results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on both templates. This suggests its potential as a valuable approach for clinical ASD diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to facilitate an automatic analysis and monitoring of heart sounds has increasingly attracted tremendous efforts in the past decade. Nevertheless, lacking on standard open-access database made it difficult to maintain a sustainable and comparable research before the first release of the PhysioNet CinC Challenge Dataset. However, inconsistent standards on data collection, annotation, and partition are still restraining a fair and efficient comparison between different works. To this line, we introduced and benchmarked a first version of the Heart Sounds Shenzhen (HSS) corpus. Motivated and inspired by the previous works based on HSS, we redefined the tasks and make a comprehensive investigation on shallow and deep models in this study. First, we segmented the heart sound recording into shorter recordings (10 s), which makes it more similar to the human auscultation case. Second, we redefined the classification tasks. Besides using the 3 class categories (normal, moderate, and mild/severe) adopted in HSS, we added a binary classification task in this study, i.e., normal and abnormal. In this work, we provided detailed benchmarks based on both the classic machine learning and the state-of-the-art deep learning technologies, which are reproducible by using open-source toolkits. Last but not least, we analyzed the feature contributions of best performance achieved by the benchmark to make the results more convincing and interpretable.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease(AD) is being the burden of society and family. Applying computing-aided strategies to reveal its pathology is one of the research highlights. Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) is an emerging noninvasive and economic biomarker for AD molecular pathology. It is valuable to reveal the correlations between the plasma NFL levels and neurodegeneration, especially hippcampal deformations at the preclinical stage. The negative correlation between plasma NFL levels and hippocampal volumes has been documented. However, the relationship between the plasma NFL levels and the hippocampal morphometry details at the preclinical stage is still elusive. This study seeks to demonstrate the capacity of our proposed surface-based hippocampal morphometry system to discern the plasma NFL positive (NFL+>41.9 pg/L) level and plasma NFL negative (NFL-<41.9pg/L) level and illustrate its superiority to the hippocampal volume measurement by drawing the cohort of 154 CU middle aged and elderly adults. We also apply this morphometry measure and a proposed sparse coding based classification algorithm to classify CU individuals with NFL+ and NFL- levels. Experimental results show that the proposed hippocampal morphometry system offers stronger statistical power to discriminate CU subjects with NFL+ and NFL- levels, comparing with the hippocampal volume measure. Furthermore, this system can discriminate plasma NFL levels in CU individuals (Accuracy=0.86). Both the group level and individual level analysis results indicate that the association between plasma NFL levels and the hippocampal shapes can be mapped at the preclinical stage.",

      "abstract": "Conventional functional connectivity network (FCN) based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) can only reflect the relationship between pairwise brain regions. Thus, the hyper-connectivity network (HCN) has been widely used to reveal high-order interactions among multiple brain regions. However, existing HCN models are essentially spatial HCN, which reflect the spatial relevance of multiple brain regions, but ignore the temporal correlation among multiple time points. Furthermore, the majority of HCN construction and learning frameworks are limited to using a single template, while the multi-template carries richer information. To address these issues, we first employ multiple templates to parcellate the rs-fMRI into different brain regions. Then, based on the multi-template data, we propose a spatio-temporal weighted HCN (STW-HCN) to capture more comprehensive high-order temporal and spatial properties of brain activity. Next, a novel deep fusion model of multi-template called spatio-temporal weighted multi-hypergraph convolutional network (STW-MHGCN) is proposed to fuse the STW-HCN of multiple templates, which extracts the deep interrelation information between different templates. Finally, we evaluate our method on the ADNI-2 and ABIDE-I datasets for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in MCI and ASD classification, and the abnormal spatio-temporal hyper-edges discovered by our method have significant significance for the brain abnormalities analysis of MCI and ASD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aims To extract vertex‐wise features of the hippocampus and amygdala in Parkinson's disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal cognition (NC) and further evaluate their discriminatory efficacy. Methods High‐resolution 3D‐T1 data were collected from 68 PD‐MCI, 211 PD‐NC, and 100 matched healthy controls (HC). Surface geometric features were captured using surface conformal representation, and surfaces were registered to a common template using fluid registration. The statistical tests were performed to detect differences between groups. The disease‐discriminatory ability of features was also tested in the ensemble classifiers. Results The amygdala, not the hippocampus, showed significant overall differences among the groups. Compared with PD‐NC, the right amygdala in MCI patients showed expansion (anterior cortical, anterior amygdaloid, and accessory basal areas) and atrophy (basolateral ventromedial area) subregions. There was notable atrophy in the right CA1 and hippocampal subiculum of PD‐MCI. The accuracy of classifiers with multivariate morphometry statistics as features exceeded 85%. Conclusion PD‐MCI is associated with multiscale morphological changes in the amygdala, as well as subtle atrophy in the hippocampus. These novel metrics demonstrated the potential to serve as biomarkers for PD‐MCI diagnosis. Overall, these findings from this study help understand the role of subcortical structures in the neuropathological mechanisms of PD cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of noncontact presentation of human cardiopulmonary activity using a bioradar sensor is to linearly demodulate the Doppler cardiopulmonary diagram (DCD) signal from baseband signals. Arctangent demodulation can perform linear phase demodulation to obtain the DCD signal. However, the high-order harmonics and intermodulation terms (ITs) caused by the time-varying direct current (dc) offset and in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance in the baseband signals significantly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Doppler heartbeat diagram (DHD) signal. In this work, a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based algorithm is proposed to simultaneously perform time-varying dc offset compensation and I/Q imbalance correction without the need for an auxiliary device to improve the accuracy of the arctangent demodulation. The obtained results show that the SNRs of the algorithm-processed DHD signals are increased from 30.08 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math> </inline-formula> 2.41 to 68.88 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math> </inline-formula> 10.57 dB.

      "abstract": "Intelligence evaluation is a desirable intelligent application for sensing and interaction in various scenarios, e.g., education, office, and the aviation industry. For example, identifying gifted students, who learn faster and more efficiently than general students due to their neurophysiological advantages, and teaching different students according to their intelligence are urgent requirements in school education. However, current intelligence evaluation mainly relies on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, which have a problem of decreasing reliability in repeated tests. In addition, no objective assessment criteria are available in the present intelligence evaluation process. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which reflect the neuroelectrical activities of the brain, can be utilized to develop an objective and promising tool for investigating the neurophysiological advantages of gifted groups and augmenting the effects of intelligence evaluation. Consequently, we proposed a novel real-time intelligence evaluation framework based on users’ psychophysiological data. Then, we leveraged the framework to investigate a case study to asses which EEG patterns could be used to effectively characterize gifted students and distinguish them from average students. Experimental results reveal the great differences in the chaos degree of the brain (CDB) between different groups of subjects and the effectiveness of the model in identifying gifted students, thus verifying the practicability and validity of the proposed framework.",

      "abstract": "Detecting and diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD) is greatly crucial for appropriate treatment and support. In recent years, there have been efforts to develop automated methods for depression detection using machine learning techniques, which mainly analyze various data sources such as text, speech, and social media posts. However, the effectiveness and reliability of these methods may vary and more importantly, they fail to provide timely intervention and treatment to MDD patients. To address these challenges, we propose a novel electroencephalogram (EEG)-based MDD detection framework, which is named as multiview sparse dynamic graph convolution-based region-attention feature fusion network (MV-SDGC-RAFFNet). Specifically, we first design a multiview (MV) feature extractor to concurrently characterize EEG signals from temporal, spectral, and time-frequency views, providing rich semantic information on the emotional status of patients. Secondly, we introduce a sparse dynamic graph convolution network (SDGCN) to map the multidomain features into high-level representations, which avoids the limitation of over-smoothing and redundant edges existing in the conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). Finally, to efficiently fuse multidomain features, we propose a region-attention feature fusion network (RAFFNet), which applies different attention weights for brain regions and is greatly beneficial to boost the accuracy (ACC) of MDD detection. We validate the efficacy of the proposed MV-SDGC-RAFFNet framework on two public MDD datasets, and it achieves more promising detection performance against the state-of-the-art methods, indicating that our method has a prospect on clinical MDD detection.",

      "abstract": "For depression diagnosis, traditional methods such as interviews and clinical scales have been widely leveraged in the past few decades, but they are subjective, time-consuming, and labor-consuming. With the development of affective computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based depression detection methods have emerged. However, previous research has virtually neglected practical application scenarios, as most studies have focused on analyzing and modeling EEG data. Furthermore, EEG data is typically obtained from specialized devices that are large, complex to operate, and poorly ubiquitous. To address these challenges, a wearable three-lead EEG sensor with flexible electrodes was developed to obtain prefrontal-lobe EEG data. Experimental measurements show that the EEG sensor achieves promising performance (background noise of no more than 0.91 μVpp, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 26--48 dB, and electrode-skin contact impedance of less than 1 K Ω). In addition, EEG data from 70 depressed patients and 108 healthy controls were collected using the EEG sensor, and the linear and nonlinear features were extracted. The features were then weighted and selected using the Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm to improve classification performance. The experimental results show that the k-NN classifier achieves a classification accuracy of 90.70%, specificity of 96.53%, and sensitivity of 81.79%, indicating the promising potential of the three-lead EEG sensor combined with the ALO algorithm and the k-NN classifier for EEG-assisted depression diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a complex mental disease with its pathological mechanism unclear. To depict the complete picture of the abnormal information interaction in a depressed brain, this study is the first to apply fully connected multilayer brain functional (FCMBF) network framework and proposed composite FCMBF (CFCMBF) network framework, combined with graph theory to analyze the within-frequency coupling (WFC) and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) of sensor-layer and source-layer electroencephalography (EEG) signals in relevant subjects. Results showed that in the sensor-layer FCMBF network, depressive patients showed significantly reduced functional connectivity, as well as abnormal global and local information processing abilities of the network, and these network properties were significantly correlated with depressive symptoms. In addition, from the perspective of depression recognition, we found that the sensor-layer CFCMBF network could achieve better classification accuracy, especially when using the overlapping degree of node under the right center region, its accuracy could reach <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$86.88\\% \\pm 9.25 \\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> . More importantly, the construction of the CFCMBF network has higher time efficiency and less information loss, since it not only measures the WFC and CFC between brain region representative signals (BRRSs) extracted from different brain regions, but also measures these two couplings between all nodes within each brain region. Although the FCMBF network contains more complete information by calculating WFC and CFC between all nodes distributed in each region, it will result in an enormous computational cost. In summary, this study proved the utility of multilayer brain network in revealing the abnormal brain interaction patterns of depression, and our proposed method might provide methodological support for efficient depression recognition research based on multilayer brain networks.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a heterogeneous syndrome with certain individual differences among subjects. Exploring a feature selection method that can effectively mine the commonness intra-groups and the differences inter-groups in depression recognition is therefore of great significance. This study proposed a new clustering-fusion feature selection method. Hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm was used to capture the heterogeneity distribution of subjects. Average and similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithms were adopted to characterize the brain network atlas of different populations. Differences analysis was also utilized to obtain the features with discriminant performance. Experiments showed that compared with traditional feature selection methods, HCSNF method yielded the optimal classification results of depression recognition in both sensor and source layers of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Especially in the beta band of EEG data at sensor layer, the classification performance was improved by more than 6%. Moreover, the long-distance connections between parietal-occipital lobe and other brain regions not only have high discriminative power, but also significantly correlate with depressive symptoms, indicating the important role of these features in depression recognition. Therefore, this study may provide methodological guidance for the discovery of reproducible electrophysiological biomarkers and new insights into common neuropathological mechanisms of heterogeneous depression diseases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mentalising ability, indexed as the ability to understand others' beliefs, feelings, intentions, thoughts and traits, is a pivotal and fundamental component of human social cognition. However, considering the multifaceted nature of mentalising ability, little research has focused on characterising individual differences in different mentalising components. And even less research has been devoted to investigating how the variance in the structural and functional patterns of the amygdala and hippocampus, two vital subcortical regions of the “social brain”, are related to inter‐individual variability in mentalising ability. Here, as a first step toward filling these gaps, we exploited inter‐subject representational similarity analysis (IS‐RSA) to assess relationships between amygdala and hippocampal morphometry (surface‐based multivariate morphometry statistics, MMS), connectivity (resting‐state functional connectivity, rs‐FC) and mentalising ability (interactive mentalisation questionnaire [IMQ] scores) across the participants (). In IS‐RSA, we proposed a novel pipeline, that is, computing patching and pooling operations‐based surface distance (CPP‐SD), to obtain a decent representation for high‐dimensional MMS data. On this basis, we found significant correlations (i.e., second‐order isomorphisms) between these three distinct modalities, indicating that a trinity existed in idiosyncratic patterns of brain morphometry, connectivity and mentalising ability. Notably, a region‐related mentalising specificity emerged from these associations: self‐self and self‐other mentalisation are more related to the hippocampus, while other‐self mentalisation shows a closer link with the amygdala. Furthermore, by utilising the dyadic regression analysis, we observed significant interactions such that subject pairs with similar morphometry had even greater mentalising similarity if they were also similar in rs‐FC. Altogether, we demonstrated the feasibility and illustrated the promise of using IS‐RSA to study individual differences, deepening our understanding of how individual brains give rise to their mentalising abilities.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious and common psychiatric disease characterized by emotional and cognitive dysfunction. In addition, the rates of clinical diagnosis and treatment for depression are low. Therefore, the accurate recognition of depression is important for its effective treatment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which can objectively reflect the inner states of human brains, are regarded as promising physiological tools that can enable effective and efficient clinical depression diagnosis and recognition. However, one of the challenges regarding EEG-based depression recognition involves sufficiently optimizing the spatial information derived from the multichannel space of EEG signals. Consequently, we propose an adaptive channel fusion method via improved focal loss (FL) functions for depression recognition based on EEG signals to effectively address this challenge. In this method, we propose two improved FL functions that can enhance the separability of hard examples by upweighting their losses as optimization objectives and can optimize the channel weights by a proposed adaptive channel fusion framework. The experimental results obtained on two EEG datasets show that the developed channel fusion method can achieve improved classification performance. The learned channel weights include the individual characteristics of each EEG epoch, which can effectively optimize the spatial information of each EEG epoch via the channel fusion method. In addition, the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art channel fusion methods.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with a high risk of developing AD. Hippocampal morphometry analysis is believed to be the most robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers for AD and MCI. Multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS), a quantitative method of surface deformations analysis, is confirmed to have strong statistical power for evaluating hippocampus. Aims We aimed to test whether surface deformation features in hippocampus can be employed for early classification of AD, MCI, and healthy controls (HC). Methods We first explored the differences in hippocampus surface deformation among these three groups by using MMS analysis. Additionally, the hippocampal MMS features of selective patches and support vector machine (SVM) were used for the binary classification and triple classification. Results By the results, we identified significant hippocampal deformation among the three groups, especially in hippocampal CA1. In addition, the binary classification of AD/HC, MCI/HC, AD/MCI showed good performances, and area under curve (AUC) of triple‐classification model achieved 0.85. Finally, positive correlations were found between the hippocampus MMS features and cognitive performances. Conclusions The study revealed significant hippocampal deformation among AD, MCI, and HC. Additionally, we confirmed that hippocampal MMS can be used as a sensitive imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD at the individual level.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world. To reduce the incidence of AD, it's essential to quantify the AD conversion risk of mild cognitive impaired (MCI) individuals. Here, we propose an AD conversion risk estimation system (CRES), which contains an automated MRI feature extractor, brain age estimation (BAE) module, and AD conversion risk estimation module. The CRES is trained on 634 normal controls (NC) from the public IXI and OASIS cohorts, then it is evaluated on 462 subjects (106 NC, 102 stable MCI (sMCI), 124 progressive MCI (pMCI) and 130 AD) from the ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that the MRI derived age gap (AG, chronological age subtracted from the estimated brain age) significantly distinguish NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD groups with p -value =0.000017 . Considering AG as the primary factor, incorporating gender and Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) for more robust Cox multi-variate hazard analysis, we concluded that each additional year in AG is associated with 4.57% greater AD conversion risk for the MCI group. Furthermore, a nomogram was drawn to describe MCI conversion risk at the individual level in the next 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and even 8 years from baseline. This work demonstrates that CRES can estimate AG based on MRI data, evaluate AD conversion risk of the MCI subjects, and identify the individuals with high AD conversion risk, which is valuable for effective intervention and diagnosis within an early period.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a severe psychiatric illness that causes emotional and cognitive impairment and has a considerable impact on patients' thoughts, behaviors, feelings and well-being. Moreover, methods for recognizing and treating depression are lacking in clinical practice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which objectively reflect the internal workings of the brain, is a promising and objective tool for recognizing and diagnosing of depression and enhancing clinical effects. However, previous EEG feature extraction methods have not performed well when exploring the intrinsic characteristics of highly complex and nonstationary EEG signals. To address this issue, we propose a regularization parameter-based improved intrinsic feature extraction method of EEG signals via empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which mines the intrinsic patterns in EEG signals, for depression recognition. Furthermore, our method can effectively solve the problem that EMD fails to extract intrinsic features. In this method, we first select an appropriate regularization parameter to generate the regularization matrix. Next, we calculate the sum of the matrix products of the IMFs and the regularization matrix and leverage the inverse of this matrix to extract the intrinsic features. The classification results of our method on four EEG datasets reached 0.8750, 0.8850, 0.8485 and 0.7768, respectively. In addition, compared with the iEMD method, our method requires less computational costs. These results support our claim that our method can effectively strengthen the depression recognition performance, and our method outperforms state-of-the-art feature extraction approaches.",

However, it is still a challenge to evaluate the therapeutic effect of tVNS. The existing studies mainly use scales and subjective interviews to assess depression treatment. The limitation of these methods is that they do not provide a precise and real-time assessment for therapeutic efforts. To this end, we have integrated embedded systems and machine learning models for depression classification to implement the tVNS system based on bioinformatic feedback. It not only stimulates the vagus nerve through electroacupuncture, but also offers a real-time evaluation of depression symptoms by prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Brain ventricular and subcortical structures are heritable both in size and shape. Genetic influences on brain region size have been studied using conventional volumetric measures, but little is known about the genetic basis of ventricular and subcortical shapes. Here we developed pipelines to extract seven complementary shape measures for lateral ventricles, subcortical structures, and hippocampal subfields. Based on over 45,000 subjects in the UK Biobank and ABCD studies, 60 genetic loci were identified to be associated with brain shape features ( P &lt; 1.09 × 10 -10 ), 19 of which were not detectable by volumetric measures of these brain structures. Ventricular and subcortical shape features were genetically related to cognitive functions, mental health traits, and multiple brain disorders, such as the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Vertex-based shape analysis was performed to precisely localize the brain regions with these shared genetic influences. Mendelian randomization suggests brain shape causally contributes to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. Our results uncover the genetic architecture of brain shape for ventricular and subcortical structures and prioritize the genetic factors underlying disease-related shape variations.",

      "abstract": "Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain are now widely recognized as the defining hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), followed by structural atrophy detectable on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. One of the particular neurodegenerative regions is the hippocampus to which the influence of Aβ/tau on has been one of the research focuses in the AD pathophysiological progress. This work proposes a novel framework, Federated Morphometry Feature Selection (FMFS) model, to examine subtle aspects of hippocampal morphometry that are associated with Aβ/tau burden in the brain, measured using positron emission tomography (PET). FMFS is comprised of hippocampal surface-based feature calculation, patch-based feature selection, federated group LASSO regression, federated screening rule-based stability selection, and region of interest (ROI) identification. FMFS was tested on two Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts to understand hippocampal alterations that relate to Aβ/tau depositions. Each cohort included pairs of MRI and PET for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Experimental results demonstrated that FMFS achieves an 89× speedup compared to other published state-of-the-art methods under five independent hypothetical institutions. In addition, the subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield) were identified as hippocampal subregions where atrophy is strongly associated with abnormal Aβ/tau. As potential biomarkers for Aβ/tau pathology, the features from the identified ROIs had greater power for predicting cognitive assessment and for survival analysis than five other imaging biomarkers. All the results indicate that FMFS is an efficient and effective tool to reveal associations between Aβ/tau burden and hippocampal morphometry.",

      "abstract": "Biomarker assisted preclinical/early detection and intervention in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may be the key to therapeutic breakthroughs. One of the presymptomatic hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the human brain. However, current methods to detect Aβ pathology are either invasive (lumbar puncture) or quite costly and not widely available (amyloid PET). Our prior studies show that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based hippocampal multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) are an effective neurodegenerative biomarker for preclinical AD. Here we attempt to use MRI-MMS to make inferences regarding brain Aβ burden at the individual subject level. As MMS data has a larger dimension than the sample size, we propose a sparse coding algorithm, Patch Analysis-based Surface Correntropy-induced Sparse-coding and Max-Pooling (PASCS-MP), to generate a low-dimensional representation of hippocampal morphometry for each individual subject. Then we apply these individual representations and a binary random forest classifier to predict brain Aβ positivity for each person. We test our method in two independent cohorts, 841 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 260 subjects from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Experimental results suggest that our proposed PASCS-MP method and MMS can discriminate Aβ positivity in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [Accuracy (ACC) = 0.89 (ADNI)] and in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals [ACC = 0.79 (ADNI) and ACC = 0.81 (OASIS)]. These results compare favorably relative to measures derived from traditional algorithms, including hippocampal volume and surface area, shape measures based on spherical harmonics (SPHARM) and our prior Patch Analysis-based Surface Sparse-coding and Max-Pooling (PASS-MP) methods.",

      "abstract": "The suppression of distracting information in order to focus on an actual cognitive goal is a key feature of executive functions. The use of brain imaging methods to investigate the underlying neurobiological brain activations that occur during conflict processing have demonstrated a strong involvement of the fronto-parietal attention network (FPAN). Surprisingly, the directional interconnections, their time courses and activations at different frequency bands remain to be elucidated, and thus, this constitutes the focus of this study. The shared information flow between brain areas of the FPAN is provided for frequency bands ranging from the theta to the lower gamma band (4–40 Hz). We employed an adaptation of the Simon task utilizing Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Granger causality was applied to investigate interconnections between the active brain regions, as well as their directionality. Following stimulus onset, the middle frontal precentral cortex and superior parietal cortex were significantly activated during conflict processing in a time window of between 300 to 600ms. Important differences in causality were found across frequency bands between processing of conflicting stimuli in the left as compared to the right visual hemifield. The exchange of information from and to the FPAN was most prominent in the beta band. Moreover, the anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula represented key areas for conflict monitoring, either by receiving input from other areas of the FPAN or by generating output themselves. This indicates that the salience network is at least partly involved in processing conflict information. The present study provides detailed insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of the FPAN, especially regarding its temporal characteristics and directional interconnections.",

      "abstract": "Background: Disease progression prediction based on neuroimaging biomarkers is vital in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proved to be powerful for various computer vision research by refining reliable and high-level feature maps from image patches. Objective: A key challenge in applying CNN to neuroimaging research is the limited labeled samples with high dimensional features. Another challenge is how to improve the prediction accuracy by joint analysis of multiple data sources (i.e., multiple time points or multiple biomarkers). To address these two challenges, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework based on CNN. Methods: First, we pre-trained CNN on the ImageNet dataset and transferred the knowledge from the pre-trained model to neuroimaging representation. We used this deep model as feature extractor to generate high-level feature maps of different tasks. Then a novel unsupervised learning method, termed Multi-task Stochastic Coordinate Coding (MSCC), was proposed for learning sparse features of multi-task feature maps by using shared and individual dictionaries. Finally, Lasso regression was performed on these multi-task sparse features to predict AD progression measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). Results: We applied this novel CNN-MSCC system on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset to predict future MMSE/ADAS-Cog scales. We found our method achieved superior performances compared with seven other methods. Conclusion: Our work may add new insights into data augmentation and multi-task deep model research and facilitate the adoption of deep models in neuroimaging research.",

Abnormal enlargements of VV can be detected before clinically significant memory decline. However, VV does not pinpoint the details of subregional ventricular expansions. Here we introduce a ventricular morphometry analysis system (VMAS) that generates a whole connected 3D ventricular shape model and encodes a great deal of ventricular surface deformation information that is inaccessible by VV. VMAS contains an automated segmentation approach and surface-based multivariate morphometry statistics. We applied VMAS to two independent datasets of cognitively unimpaired (CU) groups. To our knowledge, it is the first work to detect ventricular abnormalities that distinguish normal aging subjects from those who imminently progress to clinically significant memory decline. Significant bilateral ventricular morphometric differences were first shown in 38 members of the Arizona APOE cohort, which included 18 CU participants subsequently progressing to the clinically significant memory decline within 2 years after baseline visits (progressors), and 20 matched CU participants with at least 4 years of post-baseline cognitive stability (non-progressors). VMAS also detected significant differences in bilateral ventricular morphometry in 44 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects (18 CU progressors vs. 26 CU non-progressors) with the same inclusion criterion. Experimental results demonstrated that the ventricular anterior horn regions were affected bilaterally in CU progressors, and more so on the left. VMAS may track disease progression at subregional levels and measure the effects of pharmacological intervention at a preclinical stage.",

      "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it has been shown to be less efficient in clearing extracellular fibrillary amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, which would accelerate brain deformations from the hippocampus and medial temporal regions to the rest cortical regions (Liu et al., 2013; Cacciaglia et al., 2018). So it is valuable and necessary to reveal and intervene the hippocampal degenerations related to APOE-e4 before the onset of AD. The dose-dependent impact of APOE-e4 on hippocampal volumes has been documented, but its influence on general hippocampal morphology in cognitively unimpaired individuals is still elusive. To decode the exactly deformative hippocampal subregions, this work proposed to apply a novel surface-based hippocampal morphometry framework to study the APOE-e4 dose effects on a cognitively unimpaired cohort. The proposed automated framework includes hippocampal surface segmentation and reconstruction (Patenaude et al., 2011), higher-order hippocampal surface correspondence computation (Leporé et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011), and hippocampal surface deformation analysis with multivariate statistics (see Figure 1) (Wang et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2018). This pipeline was conducted on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) database of 117 cognitively unimpaired subjects aged between 50 to 85 years (mean=57.4, SD=6.3), including 36 heterozygotes (HT: e3/e4), 37 homozygotes (HM: e4/e4) and 44 non-carriers (NC: e3/e3). Table 1 shows the demographic information of subjects. In our experiments, we analyzed hippocampal morphometry differences of the group contrasts of HM vs. NC, HT vs NC, and HM vs. HT. Their corresponding effect sizes were estimated using the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) (Shi et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). As shown in Figure 2, our hippocampal morphometry statistics showed greater statistical power by distinguishing cognitively unimpaired subjects with two, one, and no APOE-e4 alleles.",

      "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The dose-dependent impact of this allele on hippocampal volumes has been documented, but its influence on general hippocampal morphology in cognitively unimpaired individuals is still elusive. Capitalizing on the study of a large number of cognitively unimpaired late middle aged and older adults with two, one and no APOE-e4 alleles, the current study aims to characterize the ability of our automated surface-based hippocampal morphometry algorithm to distinguish between these three levels of genetic risk for AD and demonstrate its superiority to a commonly used hippocampal volume measurement. We examined the APOE-e4 dose effect on cross-sectional hippocampal morphology analysis in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) database of 117 cognitively unimpaired subjects aged between 50 and 85 years (mean = 57.4, SD = 6.3), including 36 heterozygotes (e3/e4), 37 homozygotes (e4/e4) and 44 non-carriers (e3/e3). The proposed automated framework includes hippocampal surface segmentation and reconstruction, higher-order hippocampal surface correspondence computation, and hippocampal surface deformation analysis with multivariate statistics. In our experiments, the surface-based method identified APOE-e4 dose effects on the left hippocampal morphology. Compared to the widely-used hippocampal volume measure, our hippocampal morphometry statistics showed greater statistical power by distinguishing cognitively unimpaired subjects with two, one, and no APOE-e4 alleles. Our findings mirrored previous studies showing that APOE-e4 has a dose effect on the acceleration of brain structure deformities. The results indicated that the proposed surface-based hippocampal morphometry measure is a potential preclinical AD imaging biomarker for cognitively unimpaired individuals.",

To validate the microgravity-induced physiological and psychological effects on EEG, quantitative EEG features, cardiovascular indicators, mood state, and cognitive performances data collection was achieved during a 45 day period using a -6A degrees head-down bed rest (HDBR) integrated approach. The results demonstrated significant differences in EEG data, as an increased Theta wave, a decreased Beta wave and a reduced complexity of brain, accompanied with an increased heart rate and pulse rate, decreased positive emotion, and degraded emotion conflict monitoring performance. The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based cardiovascular and cognitive related EEG model showed the cardiovascular effect on EEG mainly affected bilateral temporal region and the cognitive effect impacted parietal-occipital and frontal regions. The results obtained in the study support the use of an approach which combines a multi-factor influential mechanism hypothesis. The changes in the EEG data may be influenced by both cardiovascular and cognitive effects.",

      "abstract": "In an increasingly knowledge based world, people are confronted with an explosion of information from the environment which must be viewed in restricted attention spans. Hence there is a need to investigate how best to model our Visual Attention (VA) with a view to allocate our attention efficiently. We use the color-word Stroop task combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) to model VA: subjects undertake the Stroop task and their EEG is recorded. This is in contrast to other studies that use techniques such as Event Related Potentials (ERP), Contextual Modeling Frameworks, eye movements and facial recognition. The paper presents a simple and useful model to recognize VA dynamically. We use the linear EEG features of different cortical fields as the main inference factors, and take the response time (RT) of the Stroop task as a metric to quantify subject performance. First, we obtain the most relevant EEG feature vectors from the recording, using a correlation analysis. Second, we use experimental data for training the VA model, using a regression method. Last, we then apply further experimental data to test the proposed model. The results from the tests conducted demonstrate that our model maps visual attention very closely. © 2013 IEEE.",

This paper describes a research project conducted to investigate the use of electroencephalography (EEG) signals to extend the current approaches and enrich AR. EEG processing and classification algorithms are applied to EEG data to identify a group of features that can be used to effectively implement AR. The experimental results reported in this paper are encouraging with correct classification rates achieved being: 51.9% where attention is divided into 5 classes and 63.9% where attention id divided into 3 classes. The distribution of the `training tuples' and `testing tuples' is discussed along with their impact on the reported results. The paper concludes with an overview of outstanding issues and consideration of projected future research.",

      "abstract": "There have been a number of research projects which have addressed depression, the focus often being on aspects of pharmacology and psychology. Relatively few of the investigations have tried to integrate depression and the related issues into a pervasive depression prevention system incorporating user-centered design. In this paper we propose an approach to provide relief for a user(s) depression by implementing a personalized treatment program; this is implemented in an electroencephalogram (EEG) based music therapy system. EEG plays two roles in this approach: to identify the user (a critical factor in achieving personalized service provision) and to measure the degree of depression. This paper considers the methodology of our EEG approach with design parameters for each component in a pervasive environment. The experiments involved 22 subjects and 4 subjects respectively in user identification and depression detection to evaluate the EEG approach. The results reported are positive and support the conclusion that the EEG approach provides an effective approach to user-centered depression prevention Additionally, the research outcomes support the conclusion that a mobile music therapy system offers beneficial effects for the treatment of depression. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on challenges, outstanding research questions, and future work.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, many people suffer from negative moods like sadness or anxiety. As an effective tool to relieve such moods, music therapy is widely embraced. Furthermore, researchers try to use newly developed bio-feedback technologies like electroencephalograms (EEG) to measure the effects of music therapy since it can reflect people's emotion sensitively and objectively. In this paper, we design a mobile platform of music therapy based on EEG feedback. The platform can record user's EEG in real time, analyze the emotion state, and choose a suitable music track to play. Users can adjust their emotion at anytime and anywhere. They can examine the therapeutic effects in time by observing EEG feedback on mobile client. In consideration of the hardware and software resources of mobile device limitations, we only collect EEG data from two channels and barely compute beta/alpha power ratio and alpha lateralization as the signal features used to measure test subjects' emotion status. Accordingly, we've committed experiments involving 4 subjects. Preliminary results show that the prototype design of the music therapy is fitful and it can be used in the mobile platform because of its simplicity and accuracy. ©2010 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel approach for automatic matching, ranking and retrieval of video clips is proposed. Motivated by the maximal and optimal matching theories in graph analysis, a new similarity measure of video clips is defined based on the representation and modeling of bipartite graph. Four different factors: visual similarity, granularity, interference and temporal order of shots are taken into consideration for similarity ranking. These factors are progressively analyzed in the proposed approach. Maximal matching utilizes the granularity factor to efficiently filter false matches, while optimal matching takes into account the visual, granularity and interference factors for similarity measure. Dynamic programming is also formulated to quantitatively evaluate the temporal order of shots. The final similarity measure is based on the results of optimal matching and dynamic programming. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in retrieving and ranking similar video clips.",
