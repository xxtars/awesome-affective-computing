    "trend_summary": "Tong Zhang's research centers on rigorous, neurophysiologically grounded affective AI—especially EEG-driven emotion decoding—with strong emphasis on interpretability, multimodal fusion, and clinical translation. A dominant trend is the integration of graph neural networks with physiological signal modeling to capture brain functional connectivity, while consistently addressing real-world challenges: individual variability (via cross-subject/domain adaptation), annotation noise and subjectivity (via uncertainty modeling and crowdsourcing-aware architectures), and clinical validity (e.g., depression detection, neurodegenerative disorder biomarkers). Recent work increasingly bridges computational psychiatry and human-centered AI—leveraging LLMs, dynamic graphs, disentanglement, and orthogonal representation learning—not just for accuracy but for mechanistic insight and deployable trustworthiness.",

      "abstract": "In 1987, Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu introduced the five-minute rule, a simple, storage-memory-economics-based heuristic for deciding when data should live in DRAM rather than on storage. Subsequent revisits to the rule largely retained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and workload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first principles, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and physics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these elements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable provisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially GPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained random access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a few seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and exposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further introduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and sensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research. Finally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system design space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift. Overall, we turn a classical heuristic into an actionable, feasibility-aware analysis and provisioning framework and set the stage for further research on AI-era memory hierarchy.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of generative models, detecting generated fake images to prevent their malicious use has become a critical issue recently. Existing methods frame this challenge as a naive binary image classification task. However, such methods focus only on visual clues, yielding trained detectors susceptible to overfitting specific image patterns and incapable of generalizing to unseen models. In this paper, we address this issue from a multi-modal perspective and find that fake images cannot be properly aligned with corresponding captions compared to real images. Upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective detector termed ITEM by leveraging the image-text misalignment in a joint visual-language space as discriminative clues. Specifically, we first measure the misalignment of the images and captions in pre-trained CLIP's space, and then tune a MLP head to perform the usual detection task. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical misalignment scheme that first focuses on the whole image and then each semantic object described in the caption, which can explore both global and fine-grained local semantic misalignment as clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors with impressive generalization and robustness on various recent generative models.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning. We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism: visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at https://github.com/feufhd/VideoAnchor.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\\%\\text{-}4.8\\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\\%\\text{-}3.9\\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.",

      "abstract": "In Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), data noise arising from various sources can lead to uncertainty in Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU), significantly impacting model performance. Current efforts to address AU have insufficiently explored its sources. They primarily focus on modeling noise rather than implementing targeted modeling based on its origin. Consequently, these approaches struggle to effectively mitigate the influence of AU, resulting in sustained limitations in model performance. Our research identifies that the AU primarily stems from two problems: subjective bias in the annotation process and the complex set relationships of sentiment features. To specifically address them, we propose DFMU, a Distribution-based Framework for Modeling Aleatoric Uncertainty, which incorporates an uncertainty modeling block capable of encoding uncertainty distributions and adaptively adjusting optimization objectives. Furthermore, we introduce distribution-based contrastive learning with sentiment words replacement to better capture the complex relationships among features. Extensive experiments on three public MSA datasets, i.e., MOSI, MOSEI, and SIMS, demonstrate that the proposed model maintains robust performance even under high noise conditions and achieves state-of-the-art results on these popular datasets.",

This paper introduces a novel method, the dual-gate Chebyshev Linkage network (DGC-Link), which comprises three main components: the Chebyshev Linkage (CL) module for extracting regional correlation features, the dual-gate module for regulating the flow of different-order information, and the deep network for extracting multi-channel features and enhancing representation capabilities. Validated on three datasets (SEED, DREAMER, and MPED) with ablation experiments demonstrating each component's effectiveness, DGC-Link achieves superior recognition performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it achieves 96.43% accuracy on differential entropy on the SEED dataset, and 98.58%, 97.62%, and 98.01% for valence, arousal, and dominance classifications on the DREAMER dataset, along with 78.48% and 44.93% for 3-class and 7-class classifications on the MPED dataset. These results highlight DGC-Link's potential for improved performance in EEG emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Image outpainting, a challenging generative task, has advanced significantly with the introduction of text-to-image diffusion models (DM). Despite these advances, DM-based methods frequently encounter the phenomenon in which one modal takes precedence over another, causing the image to be over-guided. Current research relies on manual hyperparameters to achieve bimodal balance. To reduce reliance, Prompt Libra is proposed to automatically balance bimodal prompts during inference and enhance extrapolated images. Given the variation of bimodal cross-attention during DM denoising, we create an adaptive bimodal attention module via attention maps. Furthermore, we design a classifier-free guidance computation based on masked images to improve the semantic control of the masked part and enhance the quality of images. Finally, we propose a semantic transformer to address the problem of quality degradation caused by incomplete prompts. It extracts limited semantics from the source images, which is suitable for scenarios lacking text prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates images that achieve the state-of-the-art effect on several image quality evaluation metrics while maintaining the image and text prompts in balance.",

The heat dissipation effects of different flow channel designs, inlet flow rates, and discharge rates were compared and analyzed. It is found that the design of double serpentine pipes and different coolant inlet directions of the two pipelines is the most effective for reducing the battery module High temperatures are particularly critical. Simultaneously, alterations in the flow channel design of the cooling plate, as well as variations in the inlet flow velocity and discharge rate, exert a notable influence on temperature control across the battery module.",

      "abstract": "Metric learning aims to learn a discriminative metric space, where samples of the same class stay close, and those of different classes far apart. Existing classical metric learning methods based on linear transformation have limited learning performance due to the low representation capability. Although deep metric learning learns nonlinear mappings, the training may come across convergence issues and be unstable. Additionally, many classical metric learning algorithms suffer from long computational time for iterative optimization especially when data dimension is high. Deep metric learning also requires high training cost. To learn a metric space more efficiently and effectively, this article proposes a novel broad metric learning (BML) model, which learns the data transformation by training a broad network. BML maps input data to a broad feature space by fast and convenient nonlinear feature mapping based on random weights, and learns a linear transformation to a discriminative output space. Intraclass distance is reduced by minimizing the distance between data and their class-specific reference points in the target space. The hard-triplet distance learning (HDL) is proposed to learn the distance of hard positive and negative sample pairs, which enhances the intraclass compactness and interclass separation. Closed-form solutions are adopted to solve the optimization problems efficiently when learning the linear transformation. Experiments are conducted on nine datasets to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of BML. BML learns fast and achieves high classification and clustering accuracies in the learned data space.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is typically accompanied by varying topological dynamics across brain network modularity due to the influence of time-variant and subject-specific factors. Current works primarily characterize the electroencephalograms (EEG) topological relationships based on prior predefined brain regions. However, this predefined strategy cannot dynamically fit to different individuals, which may affect the adaptability of unseen individual for depression detection. This article proposes an adaptive cluster-oriented modularity graph neural network (ACM-GNN) to enhance the adaptability of individual topological interaction for depression detection. Specifically, a cluster-oriented modularity construction (CMC) module dynamically clusters EEG channels into different brain regions based on channel-pairs contrastive learning. It can adaptively construct brain modularity to fit different individual instances. Furthermore, a modularity graph interaction learning (MGIL) module performs multilayer graph information interaction between EEG globality and modularity levels. In this way, more powerful hierarchical information can be integrated by further aggregating representations at different levels. Experiments on two public datasets, MODMA and PRED+CT, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art EEG depression detection methods. Finally, investigations on brain activities reveal the importance of dynamic modular relations for depression detection.",

      "abstract": "In this article, the social power evolution problem is investigated for a social network with a centralized media and multiple DeGroot individuals, where the centralized media impacts the evolution of individuals’ opinions through the centralization parameter at the broadcast moment, while the network topology among the individuals is influenced by the relative interaction matrix. Then, the convergence of the corresponding opinion dynamics on the time scale is derived by discussing three distinct initial social powers. By integrating the reflected appraisal mechanism, a social power evolution model with the centralized media is established, which is essentially a nonlinear mapping. Based on the Jacobian matrix of this nonlinear mapping, it is proved that both the social powers of the centralized media and DeGroot individuals can converge provided that the centralization parameter exceeds a certain threshold; furthermore, a lower bound for the centralized media’s final social power is estimated, which helps to demonstrate that the centralized media possesses the greatest social power within the whole network. Additionally, concerning individuals’ final social powers, all individuals are first divided into three categories, and a sufficient condition is presented to ensure that the balanced individual has the greatest social power except for the centralized media. Finally, the obtained results are illustrated by a numerical example.",

Previous methods often relied on style transfer strategies or text-attention manipulation, which frequently result in undesirable artifacts or distorted facial defects. We propose DMDM, an age transformation method by Dual-Modal collaborative attention using Diffusion Models. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative text-image attention based editing method that balances age semantic control and visual harmony of generated face. To further refine fidelity, we propose the Softer Image Attention Injection Mechanism, which dynamically integrates image guidance. Additionally, we design a query image set to retrieve relevant images accroding to source face and other attributes for image guidance. Finally, Age-aware Face Restoration module is proposed to enhance high-frequency details according to age through a cascaded refinement pipeline. Extensive experiment demonstrates that DMDM achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in visual quality.",

      "abstract": "Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed to address distributional shifts.",

      "abstract": "Credit card (CC) fraud detection within the realm of financial security faces challenges such as data imbalance, large-scale anonymized transaction datasets, and the need for system-specific model training. Past methods often fail to address these aforementioned issues simultaneously. Utilizing a single model results in a lack of zero-shot capability without adaptation for real-world scenarios. This article introduces LLM40FD, a novel framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to overcome these obstacles in anonymous zero-shot fraud detection. LLM40FD addresses the aforementioned challenges in CC fraud detection by employing a distribution-based one-class function and the walking embedding, without reliance on labeled data or fine-tuning in downstream. Additionally, LLM40FD enhances the model’s ability to detect fraudulent patterns and define robust decision boundaries. This is achieved through a dual-augmentation strategy and implicit contrastive learning, which generate enriched positive and negative samples. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM40FD not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the full-shot setting but also exhibits strong zero-shot capability even with limited training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments to validate the effectiveness and working mechanism of LLM40FD.",

      "abstract": "Missing traffic data caused by sensor failures or communication errors significantly hinders the efficiency of downstream tasks in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as the critical functions of traffic monitoring and decision-making. Since missing data contains important information, it is essential to extract dynamic spatial-temporal correlations in traffic processes by incorporating these missing features. Motivated by these concerns, a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Imputation Network with Missing Features (DSTMIN) is proposed to accurately impute traffic data. DSTMIN comprises an embedding layer, a Mask Attention module (MA), and a Fusion Graph Convolution module (FGC). Specifically, an embedding layer is designed to accurately represent the distribution of missing data, thereby capturing both temporal features and missing features. Furthermore, in order to effectively capture the temporal correlations, MA integrates the missing features to emphasize the significance of observed data and reduce the adverse effects caused using incomplete data. To capture spatial correlations, FGC constructs the spatial graphs and model dynamic spatial correlations from traffic subsequences and the missing-data graph in the presence of missing features. The proposed DSTMIN is adequately evaluated to demonstrate its superior performance on two datasets, which achieves a remarkable 20% reduction in imputation error compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Due to the complexity and self-evolutionary property of graph data in reality, graph learning methods require both validity to represent unstructured data and scalability to adapt to evolving graphs. However, current works have representation learning limitations on optimizable graph feature space due to the bottleneck of the structure depth. Moreover, they encounter a complete retraining process when graphs evolve, especially in the case without the assistance of new labels. To address the above issues, we propose a scalable graph broad network (SGB-Net), which contains three proposed modules: the graph feature broad transformation layer (GFBT layer) for enhancing graph embedding and two update algorithms (SGB-Net-U, SGB-Net-S) for endowing scalability. The GFBT layer aims to explicitly expand the graph feature space and broadly build the model. It constructs two expandable feature spaces in various graph scales to embed graphs discriminatively. SGB-Net-U is an exploratory method designed to tackle the label-free graph incremental learning (GIL) problem by leveraging unsupervised incremental knowledge to expand graph representation. SGB-Net-S endows scalability in classical incremental learning scenarios involving labels. Benefiting from its broad construction framework, SGB-Net not only enhances graph embeddings but also seamlessly adapts and improves performance in response to graph expansion without requiring retraining. In the experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, SGB-Net outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.",

      "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with puzzles, which require precise perception, rule comprehension, and logical reasoning. Assessing and enhancing their performance in this domain is crucial, as it reflects their ability to engage in structured reasoning - an essential skill for real-world problem-solving. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus on reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To address these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple difficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking). Our results reveal that even the state-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with these puzzles, highlighting fundamental limitations in their puzzle-solving capabilities. Most importantly, through systematic experiments, we identify and analyze key factors influencing LVLMs' puzzle-solving performance, including the number of clues, grid size, and rule complexity. Furthermore, we explore two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies that can be used in post-training: SFT on solutions (S-SFT) and SFT on synthetic reasoning processes (R-SFT). While both methods significantly improve performance on trained puzzles, they exhibit limited generalization to unseen ones. We will release VGRP-Bench to facilitate further research on LVLMs for complex, real-world problem-solving. Project page: https://yufan-ren.com/subpage/VGRP-Bench/.",

      "abstract": "The underlying time-variant and subject-specific brain dynamics lead to inconsistent distributions in electroencephalogram (EEG) topology and representations within and between individuals. However, current works primarily align the distributions of EEG representations, overlooking the topology variability in capturing the dependencies between channels, which may limit the performance of EEG emotion recognition. To tackle this issue, this article proposes an adaptive attention-modulated graph network (AdamGraph) to enhance the subject adaptability of EEG emotion recognition against connection variability and representation variability. Specifically, an attention-modulated graph connection module is proposed to explicitly capture the individual important relationships among channels adaptively. Through modulating the attention matrix of individual functional connections using spatial connections based on prior knowledge, the attention-modulated weights can be learned to construct individual connections adaptively, thereby mitigating individual differences. Besides, a deep node-graph representation learning module is designed to extract long-range interaction characteristics among channels and alleviate the over-smoothing problem of representations. Furthermore, a graph domain co-regularized learning module is imposed to tackle the individual distribution discrepancies in connection and representations across different domains. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., SEED, DREAMER, and MPED, validate the superior performance of AdamGraph compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "This study proposes a UI interface generation method based on a diffusion model, aiming to achieve high-quality, diversified, and personalized interface design through generative artificial intelligence technology. The diffusion model is based on its step-by-step denoising generation process. By combining the conditional generation mechanism, design optimization module, and user feedback mechanism, the model can generate a UI interface that meets the requirements based on multimodal inputs such as text descriptions and sketches provided by users. In the study, a complete experimental evaluation framework was designed, and mainstream generation models (such as GAN, VAE, DALL·E, etc.) were selected for comparative experiments. The generation results were quantitatively analyzed from indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and FID. The results show that the model proposed in this study is superior to other models in terms of generation quality and user satisfaction, especially in terms of logical clarity of information transmission and visual aesthetics. The ablation experiment further verifies the key role of conditional generation and design optimization modules in improving interface quality. This study provides a new technical path for UI design automation and lays the foundation for the intelligent and personalized development of human-computer interaction interfaces. In the future, the application potential of the model in virtual reality, game design, and other fields will be further explored.",

      "abstract": "The limitations of acquisition equipment often result in scene image data of limited size, posing a challenge for comprehensive analysis of social image datasets. Advances in generative models have introduced image outpainting techniques that expand the size of acquired social scene images, thereby enhancing the value of social image data. Stable diffusion (SD), which benefits from the guidance of caption prompts, shows excellent performance in image outpainting. However, its heavy reliance on manual prompts leads to a significant drawback: a decrease in the quality of generated images without prompts. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel self-prompt diffusion model for image outpainting that extrapolates images based on the semantics of the source image, thereby removing the dependence on manual prompts. Specifically, we design a prompt autoencoder that uses an autoregressive transformer to map prompt embeddings into their semantic space, facilitating the construction of a semantic decoder. The semantic decoder and prompt embeddings are then cooptimized within the proposed prompt embedding network, allowing the mapping of image features to the stable diffusion prompt embeddings. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent generative capabilities of diffusion models, we introduce a seam line regeneration mechanism to address the common problem of seam lines when splicing input and generated images. Comparative experiments on the Places2 and COCO datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on visual quality metrics and is adaptable to the stable diffusion model without additional fine-tuning.",

Existing VFL methods exhibit tightly coupled participant parameters, resulting in substantial interdependencies among clients during the prediction phase, which significantly hampers the model's usability. To tackle these challenges, this paper studies a VFL approach with low coupling of parameters between clients. Drawing inspiration from federated cooperation and teacher-supervised learning, we propose a low-coupling vertical federated learning with privileged information paradigm (VFL+), allowing participants to make autonomous predictions. Specifically, VFL+ treats information from other clients as privileged data during the training phase rather than the testing phase, thereby achieving independence in individual model predictions. Subsequently, this paper further investigates three typical scenarios of vertical cooperation and designs corresponding cooperative frameworks. Systematic experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Broad learning system (BLS) have demonstrated excellent performance in terms of both speed and accuracy in tasks such as image classification. In BLS, the feature nodes predominantly utilize linear features, and sparse representation is mainly employed in the feature optimization component. The robustness of these features to different data needs to be improved. Although there are many improved algorithms for BLS in feature optimization, there is no improvement based on fractional calculus at present. This article proposes BLS-FC, a novel data classification and regression method that can seamlessly combine BLS and fractional calculation. Fractional calculus describes the properties of data between integer orders and has memory properties. Fractional Fourier transform (Frft) also has time domain and frequency domain information. First, Frft is added to the broad learning feature node extraction to enrich the node features, which is called BLS-Frft. Second, fractional calculus is integrated into the BLS-Frft sparse representation feature optimization, and the feature representation capability is enhanced by fractional differential memory. This part is called BLS-FS. Finally, in order to solve the problem of unstable features of random fractional order subspaces, a fractional order multiscale feature interaction based on BLS-Frft is proposed, which is called BLS-MF. Experimental results across various classification and regression datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",

As one of the commonly used atmospheric data sensors, the probe is usually mounted on the aircraft nose. Due to the need to obtain high-accuracy atmospheric parameters for civil aircraft, the installation accuracy of probes usually has strict installation requirements. In this paper, the aerodynamic analysis of the probe’s step height to measurement error of air pressure height under different angles of attack is studied. The conclusion can provide a reference for establishing the requirements of probe installation gradient.",

Existing methods measure users’ conformity factors to reduce the impact of popularity bias. However, these methods do not consider the differences in users’ conformity behavior in the long-term and short-term. To address this, we propose LSDRec, a novel debiased SR method structured around three key tasks: degree-centrality conformity awareness, dual-scale interest encoding, and adaptive conformity information fusing. The degree-centrality conformity awareness task constructs a multiuser interaction graph, employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to obtain global user conformity representations, and uses the degree centrality algorithm to compute users’ long-term and short-term conformity factors. The dual-scale interest encoding task models users’ long-term and short-term interests separately, obtaining corresponding interest representations and further enhancing them through the adaptive conformity information fusing task. The adaptive conformity information fusing task contrasts global conformity representations with long-term and short-term interest representations, adaptively integrating conformity factors and dynamically adjusting the degree of conformity information transfer. Together, these three tasks effectively mitigate popularity bias and improve the accuracy of user interest modeling. Our extensive evaluations of four diverse datasets demonstrate LSDRec's superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims at accurately identifying emotional states expressed in conversational content. Existing ERC methods, although relying on semantic understanding, often encounter challenges when confronted with incomplete or misleading semantic information. In addition, when dealing with the interaction between emotional and semantic information, existing methods are often difficult to effectively distinguish the complex relationship between the two, which affects the accuracy of emotion recognition. To address the problems of semantic misdirection and emotional cross-talk encountered by traditional models when confronted with complex conversational data, we propose a semantic and emotional dual channel (SEDC) strategy for emotion recognition in conversations to process emotional and semantic information independently. Under this strategy, emotion information provides an auxiliary recognition function when the semantics are unclear or lacking, enhancing the accuracy of the model. Our model consists of two modules: the emotion processing module accurately captures the emotional features of each utterance through contrastive learning, and then constructs a dialogue emotion propagation map to simulate the emotional information conveyed in the dialogue; the semantic processing module combines an external knowledge base to enhance the semantic expression of the dialogue through knowledge enhancement strategies. This divide-and-conquer approach allows us to more deeply analyze the emotional and semantic dimensions of complex dialogues. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP, EmoryNLP, MELD, and DailyDialog datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques and effectively improves the accuracy of dialogue emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Multiview semi-supervised learning is a popular research area in which people utilize cross-view knowledge to overcome the limitation of labeled data in semi-supervised learning. Existing methods mainly utilize deep neural network, which is relatively time-consuming due to the complex network structure and back propagation iterations. In this article, co-training broad Siamese-like network (Co-BSLN) is proposed for coupled-view semi-supervised classification. Co-BSLN learns knowledge from two-view data and can be used for multiview data with the help of feature concatenation. Different from existing deep learning methods, Co-BSLN utilizes a simple shallow network based on broad learning system (BLS) to simplify the network structure and reduce training time. It replaces back propagation iterations with a direct pseudo inverse calculation to further reduce time consumption. In Co-BSLN, different views of the same instance are considered as positive pairs due to cross-view consistency. Predictions of views in positive pairs are used to guide the training of each other through a direct logit vector mapping. Such a design is fast and effectively utilizes cross-view consistency to improve the accuracy of semi-supervised learning. Evaluation results demonstrate that Co-BSLN is able to improve accuracy and reduce training time on popular datasets.",

The neural network model must learn about human thought and expression complexity. Handling instances with different annotation opinions is the main challenge in subjective tasks. Existing methods focus on majority voting or integrating opinions from a few assigned annotators, leading to biased decisions and limited performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a cascade perspective network (CPNet) to uncover reliable disagreement for subjective tasks. Specifically, CPNet learns each annotator’s personalized knowledge from annotation disagreement and stores them in an annotator bank through the personal perspective module for abundant disagreement information. Then, CPNet obtains consistent opinions by referring to all annotators’ opinions from the annotator bank through the comprehensive perspective module to reduce bias caused by noise. CPNet improves decision-making by considering the diversity and comprehensiveness of all annotators’ opinions. Moreover, it performs well in subjective tasks with limited or numerous annotators. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on subjective datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of CPNet.",

      "abstract": "The abnormality in depression exhibits reciprocal imbalanced connectivity between brain regions rather than increased or decreased activity of one particular area. Current works primarily align the distributions of EEG electrodes with insufficient simulation of neurophysiological structures. Moreover, they neglect significant collaborative relationships among diverse brain regions, which limits the performance of MDD detection. Considering the comprehensive information across brain regions and domains, we propose a novel EEG-based MDD detection model named Time-Frequency Agent Graph Learning (TFAGL), to capture the specific whole-brain level collaborative mechanism of MDD. Specifically, we generate agent nodes adaptively to perform global interactions among regions to sufficiently simulate the function of principal neurons, thereby forming a dynamic local-global connectivity graph to capture connectivity patterns for intra- and inter-regions. Furthermore, interactive learning across different receptive fields through multi-scale graph convolution is applied for each domain and connectivity. Besides, we construct feature extractors for both time and frequency domains and apply intra- and inter-domain constraints to remove redundancy and enhance the discriminability, thus obtaining comprehensive information representations. Extensive experiments on the public EEG MDD detection datasets demonstrate the superiority of TFAGL compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) plays a vital role in understanding emotional content from social media and multimedia data. However, existing methods often rely on large-scale labeled datasets, leading to high annotation costs and poor adaptability. They also suffer from modality imbalance and suboptimal feature fusion. To address these issues, we propose MapleNet—a Multimodal Affect Perception framework enhanced by Large Language Models. MapleNet integrates a prototype-guided fusion strategy and a dynamic modality balancing mechanism to improve alignment and collaboration between text and image features. Specifically, a shared-space encoder combined with prompt optimization ensures semantic consistency across modalities. Within the prototype learning framework, the model dynamically adjusts modalityspecific learning by aligning features with class prototypes, thus mitigating imbalance and uncovering complementary affective cues. In addition, MapleNet employs a similaritybased sample retrieval module to construct contextual prompts, enriching sentiment understanding in few-shot settings. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that MapleNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially under few-shot conditions, achieving superior accuracy and generalization. The relevant code is available at https://github.com/YFanLuo/MapleNet.",

      "abstract": "Granger causality (GC) effective connectivity (EC) calculated from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has been widely used in mental disorder detection. However, the existing methods only take into account linear dynamics or nonlinear dynamics within a single sample, ignoring the nonlinear dynamics shared by the same class of subjects. In this article, a model combining graph neural networks (GNNs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) is proposed to construct shared latent nonlinear EC from raw EEG signals for depression detection. Several convolution modules and fully connected layers are used in the graph encoding network to learn the embeddings of the connectivity connected by every two EEG channels. In the graph decoding network, a class-specific Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is introduced in the VAEs to model shared dynamics in EC of the same class of subjects, and the shared dynamics combine the encoded embeddings of the EC and the past time series to restore raw EEG signals. Through a node-to-edge encoding process and an edge-to-node decoding process, the shared latent nonlinear EC in EEG signals can ultimately be learned by gradually optimizing the model's loss function. The performance of the proposed method is verified on several open-accessed datasets. The excellent results prove that the proposed neural networks can learn more generalized nonlinear EC representations, and shared latent dynamics discovery can also help to identify depression better.

      "abstract": "This study presents an advanced gesture recognition and user interface (UI) interaction system developed using deep learning technologies, emphasizing its transformative impact on UI design and functionality. By employing optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system achieves high-precision gesture recognition, significantly enhancing user interactions with digital interfaces. Initial steps involve preprocessing collected gesture images to conform to CNN input standards, followed by employing sophisticated feature extraction and classification methodologies. We address class imbalance effectively using Focal Loss as the loss function, ensuring robust model performance across varied gesture types. The experimental results showcase notable improvements in model metrics, with the AUC and Recall increasing progressively as we evolve from simpler models like VGG16 to more complex ones such as DenseNet. Our enhanced model demonstrates a significant advancement with an AUC of 0.83 and a Recall of 0.85, surpassing standard benchmarks. More critically, this system's capacity to support real-time and efficient gesture recognition paves the way for a new era in UI design—where intuitive, natural user gestures can seamlessly integrate into everyday technology use, significantly reducing the learning curve and enhancing user satisfaction. The broad implications of this development are profound, extending beyond mere technical performance to fundamentally reshape how users interact with technology. Such advancements hold considerable promise for the enhancement of smart life experiences, highlighting the pivotal role of gesture-based interactions in the next generation of UI development.",

      "abstract": "The underlying time-variant and subject-specific brain dynamics lead to statistical uncertainty in electroencephalogram (EEG) representations and connectivities under diverse individual biases. Current works primarily augment statisticallike EEG data based on deterministic modes without comprehensively considering uncertain statistical discrepancies in representations and connectivities. This results in insufficient domain diversity to cover more domain variations for a generalized model independent of individuals. This article proposes an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation network (Ugan) to generalize EEG emotion recognition across subjects by comprehensively mimicking and constraining the uncertain statistical shifts across individuals. Specifically, an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation module is employed to augment both connectivities and features of EEG graph by manipulating domain statistical characteristics. With the original and augmented EEG graph covering diverse domain variations, the model can mimic the uncertain domain shifts to achieve better generalizability against potential subject variability. To extract discriminative characteristics and preserve emotional semantics after augmentation, a graph coteaching learning module is designed to facilitate coteaching knowledge learning between the original and augmented views. Moreover, a coteaching regularization module is developed to constrain semantic domain invariance and consistency, thereby rendering the model invariant to uncertain statistical shifts. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., Shanghai Jiao Tong University emotion EEG dataset (SEED), SEED-IV, and SEED-V, validate the superior generalizability of Ugan compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Affective music generation is a challenge for symbolic music generation. Existing methods face the problem that the perceived emotion of the generated music is not evident because music datasets containing emotional labels are relatively small in quantity and scale. To address this issue, an attribute-enhanced affective music transformer (AE-AMT) model is proposed to generate perceived affective music with attribute enhancement. In addition, a multiquantile-based attribute discretization (MQAD) strategy is designed, enabling the model to generate intensity-controllable affective music pieces. Furthermore, A replication-expanded compound representation of the control signals (RECR) method is designed for control signals to improve the controllability of the model. In objective experiments, the AE-AMT model demonstrated a 29.25% and 19.5% improvement in overall emotion accuracy, along with a 30% and 32% improvement in arousal accuracy on the datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI. These improvements are achieved without significant difference in objective music quality, while also providing ample novelty and diversity compared to the current state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, subjective experiments revealed that the AE-AMT model outperformed comparison models, especially in low valence and arousal based on the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Additionally, the soft variant model of AE-AMT exhibited a significant advantage in valence, low arousal, and overall music quality. These experiments showcase the AE-AMT model's ability to significantly enhance arousal performance and strike a balance between emotional intensity and musical quality through adaptable strategies.",

      "abstract": "As a crucial component in the railway transportation system, the implementation of regular maintenance and fault detection on turnout equipment not only prevents potential operational risks but also ensures the smooth operation of the railway network. Currently, intelligent fault diagnosis for turnouts is mostly based on deep learning models, which possess strong capabilities for fault signal feature extraction and accurate identification. However, under conditions of scarcity in fault data, the performance of these models declines, resulting in low diagnostic accuracy. To address the shortcomings of these models, this paper leverages the advantages of meta-learning algorithms in addressing small-sample issues and focuses on the power curve of the ZD7 turnout switch machine. It applies the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and employs Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) encoding to convert the one-dimensional time-series power curve of the turnout switch machine into two-dimensional feature maps. A turnout fault diagnosis model based on GADF-CNN-MAML is proposed, and experiments have verified that this model effectively improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis.",

A comprehensive two-dimensional thermal model, incorporating detailed heat generation dynamics of individual cells, heat transfer mechanisms within the aluminum plate, and PCM phase transition behavior, has been developed. Utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a comparative assessment of the thermal performance between the PCM/aluminum plate fin module and a standalone PCM module is conducted under dynamic charge-discharge cycles. The results indicate that the $\\operatorname{PCM} /$ aluminum plate fin module achieves a marked reduction in both maximum temperature and temperature gradient during these cycles, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating thermal stress and enhancing temperature uniformity compared to the PCM-only module.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the estimation of dynamic route choice behavior of drivers with incomplete fixed location-based sensor data, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) data. Unlike global positioning system (GPS) data providing continuous vehicle trajectories, the location-based RFID sensors record vehicles only when they pass by but may not record all vehicles. These bring challenges for route choice modeling since empty sensor observations will also influence the likelihood of routes that do not cross these sensors. Also, it requires the essential integration of dynamic traffic conditions into the modeling process as observation paths may share the same sensor detection sequence but exhibit different travel times. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a dynamic recursive logit model to estimate vehicle route choices with RFID data, enabling the characterization of the likelihood function of sensor observation paths without the need for path enumeration between consecutive detections. Also, we develop a probabilistic dynamic link utilization estimation method to infer the actual path of each vehicle from the available sensor observations. It serves as a validation process to ensure that the route choice behavior can comprehensively reflect traffic flow dynamics. The proposed methods are evaluated using both a simulated dataset on the Sioux Falls network and a collection of real-world RFID data in Chongqing, China. The simulation results show that the proposed method can recover true choice parameters and perform significantly better compared with static models. The real-world experimental results highlight its efficacy in aggregated link flow prediction and individual trajectory reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "Effective path planning is essential for autonomous drone flight to enhance task efficiency. Many researchers have applied swarm intelligence algorithms to drone path planning. For instance, the traditional Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) has been used for this purpose. However, traditional BOA faces challenges such as slow convergence and susceptibility to being trapped in local optima. An Improved Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (IBOA) has been developed to identify optimal routes to address these limitations. Initially, ICMIC mapping is utilized to establish the butterfly community, enhancing the initial population’s diversity and preventing premature algorithm convergence. Following this, a population reset strategy is introduced, replacing weaker individuals over a specified number of iterations while maintaining a constant population size. This strategy enhances the algorithm’s ability to avoid local optima and increases its robustness. Additionally, characteristics of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are integrated to enhance the butterfly’s location update mechanism, accelerating the algorithm’s convergence rate. To evaluate the performance of the IBOA algorithm, this study designed a CEC2020 function test experiment and compared it with several swarm intelligence algorithms. The results showed that IBOA achieved the best performance in 70% of the function tests, outperforming 75% of the other algorithms. In the path planning experiments within a simulated environment, IBOA quickly converged to the optimal path, and the paths it planned were the shortest and safest compared to those generated by other algorithms.",

However, the lack of transform-invariant property limits their further applications in complicated real-world scenarios. In this work, we pro-posed a novel generalized one-dimension convolutional operator (OneDConv), which dynamically transforms the convolution kernels based on the input features in a computationally and parametrically efficient manner. The proposed operator can extract the transform-invariant features naturally. It improves the robustness and generalization of convolution without sac-rificing the performance of common images. The proposed OneDConv operator can substitute the vanilla convolution. Thus, it can readily be incorporated into popular convolutional architectures, supporting end-to-end training. Empirical evaluations on popular benchmarks reveal OneDConv's superior performance over the standard convolution and competitive models in handling canonical and distorted images.",

      "abstract": "Probability calibration is a method to improve the reliability of models by linking the predicted probability to accuracy. Most research follow a static strategy of full fine-tuning. These studies do not consider dynamic data and sparse parameters in Language Models as a Service(LMaaS), leading to limited effectiveness of probability calibration. To address above issues, we propose a dynamic probability calibration algorithm (DPCA) to consider both data flow and parameter freezing. DPCA consists of streaming annotation (SA) task and dynamic calibration (DC) task. The SA task takes a specified number of samples from the training data stream. The sampled data is automatically annotated according to the deviation between predicted probability and true label. The DC task injects the probability deviation of the SA task into next training epoch through adapter-tuning. DPCA achieves data augmentation in LMaaS through joint learning of sample labels and their predicted probability deviation. This work validates DPCA through the implementation on BERT architecutre. The proposed model achieves overall performance improvement on both Chinese and English NLP tasks. Experimental results demonstrate a 2.17% decrease in average ECE without de-creasing in accuracy. Experimental analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of DPCA in LMaaS.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal physiological signals fusion integrates multiple heterogeneous physiological signals to characterize human physiological activities, which is basic research on biomedical signal processing. Most researches on multi-modal physiological signal fusion are based on heterogeneous graph fusion networks (HGFNs) while they ignore the high-order correlations between multi-modal physiological signals. Moreover, most HGFNs suffer from the over-smoothing problem, causing failures in deeper networks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deep hypergraph convolutional network called DHFusion for multi-modal physiological signal fusion. Specially, DHFusion designs deep hypergraph convolution (DHGCN) layer to effectively integrate multiple physiological signals and obtain multi-modal features. DHFusion then introduces JK readout layer to enable multi-layer DHGCN to capture deep multi-modal features based on high-order correlations. DHFusion effectively solves the over-smoothing of HGFNs and performs well in representing deep multi-modal features. Experimental results over the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, in industry practice, we still face challenges such as sufficient data is not available for every manufacturing task, the costs associated with welding data annotation quality, and the risk of knowledge forgetting during the continual welding process. To tackle these issues, we developed an Adaptive Domain-Enhanced Transfer Learning (ADETL) framework that integrates self-supervised and continual learning strategies. This framework is adept at using incremental and unlabeled data for pre-training, in which we analyze the parameter space, loss landscape, and make the model understand the behaviour of knowledge transfer from diverse source domains. The ADETL framework improves the performance of defect classification, offering a promising solution to the challenges inherent in automatic, continuous welding operations.",

Current GNNs have achieved notable performance by dynamically modeling emotional connections between EEG channels. However, these GNNs lack interpretability due to the absence of explicit rationale behind their predictions. This paper conducts a comprehensive identification of important EEG channels to enhance the interpretability of EEG emotion recognition from the perspective of mutual information. Specifically, an Adjacency-Explainable Graph Neural Network (AEG) for ante-hoc interpretability is proposed to capture genuine EEG emotional connections, which gives a theoretical guarantee to remove spurious connections. Moreover, a Channel-wise Adaptive Class Activation Mapping Explainer (CACA) for post-hoc interpretability is developed to locate the EEG channels that contribute most to predictions. Experimental results on three datasets, i.e., SEED, SEED-IV, and DREAMER, prove that imbuing training processes with enhanced interpretability ensures significant performance improvements in emotion recognition. Quantitative comparisons of post-hoc interpretability also demonstrate the superiority of CACA. Furthermore, this paper illustrates two potential applications of the proposed methodologies, showing their broader utility and significance.",

      "abstract": "Model merging offers an effective strategy to combine the strengths of multiple finetuned models into a unified model that preserves the specialized capabilities of each. Existing methods merge models in a global manner, performing arithmetic operations across all model parameters. However, such global merging often leads to task interference, degrading the performance of the merged model. In this work, we introduce Localize-and-Stitch, a novel approach that merges models in a localized way. Our algorithm works in two steps: i) Localization: identify tiny ($1\\%$ of the total parameters) localized regions in the finetuned models containing essential skills for the downstream tasks, and ii) Stitching: reintegrate only these essential regions back into the pretrained model for task synergy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively locates sparse regions responsible for finetuned performance, and the localized regions could be treated as compact and interpretable representations of the finetuned models (tasks). Empirically, we evaluate our method on various vision and language benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing model merging methods under different data availability scenarios. Beyond strong empirical performance, our algorithm also facilitates model compression and preserves pretrained knowledge, enabling flexible and continual skill composition from multiple finetuned models with minimal storage and computational overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/Localize-and-Stitch.",

      "abstract": "The existence of emotion-irrelevant representations and individual variability impedes the extraction of robust emotional representations, limiting the adaptability of EEG emotion recognition. Massive studies focus on the mining of emotion-aware information, overlooking emotion-agnostic information, which is insufficient for the extraction of emotion-relevant features against redundancy and variation. In this paper, Graph Orthogonal Purification Network (Grop) is proposed to enhance individual adaptability through improvements in the orthogonality and transferability between emotion-relevant and emotion-irrelevant features. Specifically, the proposed Grop utilized a graph representation extraction module to capture both emotion-relevant and emotion-irrelevant features by the dual graph. The representation orthogonal purification module is developed to eliminate redundant information through feature projection and feature purification. Moreover, the dual emotional space alignment module is imposed to align distribution discrepancies in different emotion feature spaces. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed Grop, various experiments are conducted on two public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., SEED and SEED-IV. The results achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the capability of the Grop to capture robust emotion features and alleviate the intra- and inter-subject discrepancies.",

      "abstract": "Facial beauty prediction (FBP) aims to automatically predict beauty scores of facial images according to human perception. Usually, facial images contain lots of information irrelevant to facial beauty, such as information about pose, emotion, and illumination, which interferes with the prediction of facial beauty. To overcome interferences, we develop a broad Siamese network (BSN) to focus more on the task of beauty prediction. Specifically, BSN consists mainly of three components: a multitask Siamese network (MTSN), a multilayer attention (MLA) module, and a broad representation learning (BRL) module. First, MTSN is proposed with different tasks about facial beauty to fully mine knowledge about attractiveness and guide the network to neglect interference information. In the subnetwork of MTSN, the MLA module is proposed to focus more on salient features about facial beauty and reduce the impact of interference information. Then, the BRL module based on broad learning system (BLS) is developed to learn discriminative features with the guidance of beauty scores. It further releases facial features from the impact of interference information. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of BSN.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) integrates multiple modalities to identify the user's emotional state, which is the core technology of natural and friendly human–computer interaction systems. Currently, many researchers have explored comprehensive multimodal information for MER, but few consider that comprehensive multimodal features may contain noisy, useless, or redundant information, which interferes with emotional feature representation. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a sparse interactive attention network (SIA-Net) for MER. In SIA-Net, the sparse interactive attention (SIA) module mainly consists of intramodal sparsity and intermodal sparsity. The intramodal sparsity provides sparse but effective unimodal features for multimodal fusion. The intermodal sparsity adaptively sparses intramodal and intermodal interactive relations and encodes them into sparse interactive attention. The sparse interactive attention with a small number of nonzero weights then act on multimodal features to highlight a few but important features and suppress numerous redundant features. Furthermore, the intramodal sparsity and intermodal sparsity are deep sparse representations that make unimodal features and multimodal interactions sparse without complicated optimization. The extensive experimental results show that SIA-Net achieves superior performance on three widely used datasets.",

      "abstract": "Determining the relative pose of an object between two images is pivotal to the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches typically approximate the continuous pose representation with a large number of discrete pose hypotheses, which incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we present a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet) that eliminates the need for pose hypotheses and computes the relative object pose in a single pass. To this end, we map the two input RGB images, reference and query, to their respective voxelized 3D representations. We then pass the resulting voxels through a pose estimation module, where the voxels are aligned and the pose is computed in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, LINEMOD, and Objaverse datasets, demonstrating that our method delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at: https://github.com/sailor-z/DVMNet/.",

      "abstract": "Due to its marvelous performance and remarkable scalability, a broad learning system (BLS) has aroused a wide range of attention. However, its incremental learning suffers from low accuracy and long training time, especially when dealing with unstable data streams, making it difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues and enrich its relevant research, a robust incremental BLS (RI-BLS) is proposed. In this method, the proposed weight update strategy introduces two memory matrices to store the learned information, thus the computational procedure of ridge regression is decomposed, resulting in precomputed ridge regression. During incremental learning, RI-BLS updates two memory matrices and renews weights via precomputed ridge regression efficiently. In addition, this update strategy is theoretically analyzed in error, time complexity, and space complexity compared with existing incremental BLSs. Different from Greville's method used in the original incremental BLS, its results are closer to the solution of one-shot calculation. Compared with the existing incremental BLSs, the proposed method exhibits more stable time complexity and superior space complexity. The experiments prove that RI-BLS outperforms other incremental BLSs when handling both stable and unstable data streams. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that the proposed weight update strategy applies to other random neural networks as well.",

      "abstract": "In addition to internal state constraints such as lateral velocity and cross-swing angular velocity, external factors, such as a complex time-varying environment, directly impact the tracking performance. For a typical underdriven incomplete constraint system of a vehicle, it is possible to explicitly handle the physical constraints of the system while achieving high accuracy and stable trajectory tracking in the presence of parameter uncertainties and internal/external disturbances. This paper proposes a lateral trajectory tracking control algorithm based on active disturbance rejection model predictive control. By employing the concept of disturbance compensation, a multivariate extended state observer is designed to real time observe and estimate the system state and unknown disturbances, effectively compensating for them to enhance the system's robustness. Furthermore, adopting the principle of optimal control, the optimal control input is determined using a partially known adaptation model, considering the physical constraints of the system, thereby ensuring the stability of vehicle driving. Finally, comparative simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Due to the characteristics of large inertia, significant lag, and model uncertainty in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) denitrification system, traditional control schemes encounter challenges in achieving precise control. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an IMC cascade self-adaptive disturbance rejection controller based on SPSA online parameter optimization and applies it to the SCR denitrification control system. This approach effectively addresses the challenges of precise setpoint tracking, disturbance suppression due to model variations, and difficulties in controlling significant lag. The introduction of the SPSA algorithm allows the controller to update optimal parameters in real-time as the operating conditions change over time. Experimental results from setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional PID control and linear self-adaptive disturbance rejection control.",

      "abstract": "Most of the work on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition aims to extract the distinguishing features from high-dimensional EEG signals, ignoring the complementarity of information between EEG latent space and graph space. Furthermore, the influence of brain connectivity on emotions encompasses both physical structure and functional connectivity, which may have varying degrees of importance for different individuals. To address these issues, this article introduces an adaptive dual-space network (ADS-Net) with multigraph fusion aimed at capturing more comprehensive information by integrating dual-space representations. Specifically, ADS-Net models the spatial correlation of EEG channels in graph topological space, while exploring long-range dependencies and frequency relationships from EEG data in latent space. Subsequently, these representations are adaptively combined through an innovative gated fusion approach to extract complementary corepresentations. Moreover, drawing on the principles of brain connectivity theory, the proposed method constructs a multigraph to indicate the associativity of EEG channels. To further capture individual differences, an adaptive multigraph fusion mechanism is developed for the dynamic integration of physical and functional connectivity graphs. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, the superior experimental results underscore the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Although multimodal physiological data from the central and peripheral nervous systems can objectively respond to human emotional states, the individual differences caused by non-stationary and low signal-to-noise properties bring several challenges to cross-subject emotion recognition tasks. Many previous studies usually focused on learning high correlation information between different modalities, which easily leads to incomplete descriptions of different physiological signals and difficulties in aligning critical emotional information. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multimodal emotion recognition model for improving the generalization performance to unseen target domain subjects, termed Completeness-induced Adaptative Broad Learning (CiABL). The proposed CiABL can gradely explore the completeness modality representation that encompasses both modality-relevant and modality-independent information, avoiding the loss of performance due to spurious correlations from different modalities. Subsequently, a well-designed weighted representation distribution alignment mechanism of CiABL can appropriately align the marginal and conditional distributions to reduce the influences of individual differences greatly. Extensive experiments on the SEED and SEED-FRA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed CiABL, which outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, CiABL can precisely quantify the importance of global features to properly explain the modality contribution and averaged activation patterns of the brain under cross-subject emotion recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet, the application of artificial intelligence in the medical field has become a focus of attention. At present, understanding the Chinses medical inspection report (CMIR) is of great significance for clinical diagnosis, and the results of the inspection items can be used to judge the condition more intuitively. However, the existing datasets of Chinese medical inspection report is small, and their image features are complex and have more entity types, which makes Semantic entity recognition (SER) for Natural language processing (NLP) difficult. To address the lack of attention coverage for complex medical entities, this paper fine-tunes a multimodal pre-training model for multilingual visually-rich document understanding (VI-LayoutXLM), and improves the recognition of complex medical entities by the VI-LayoutXLM model through novel entity labelling in the multimodal pre-training phase. Specifically, key-value pairs are manually labelled for medical entities in the form of medical inspection report to refine the attention to complex medical entities in the Transformer. In order to verify the recognition performance of the model, this paper constructs a sample set of medical inspection report datasets (CMIRD) collected from real scenarios, which includes medical inspection report from hospitals all over China. The experimental results show that the recognition performance of the VI-LayoutXLM model outperforms multiple models on this dataset, with an F1-score up to 97.18%.",

This article proposes the temporal-tightly graph convolutional network (TT-GCN) to extract temporal features. TT-GCN comprises three significant mechanisms: the causal temporal convolution network (casual-TCN), the walking direction recognition auxiliary task, and the feature mapping layer. To obtain tight temporal dependencies and enhance the relevance among gait periods, the causal-TCN is introduced. Based on the assumption of emotional consistency in the walking directions, the auxiliary task is proposed to enhance the ability of fine-grained feature extraction. Through the feature mapping layer, affective features can be mapped into the appropriate representation and fused with deep learning features. TT-GCN shows the best performance across five comprehensive metrics. All experimental results verify the necessity and feasibility of exploring fine-grained temporal feature extraction.",

      "abstract": "Determining the relative pose of a previously unseen object between two images is pivotal to the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches typically predict 3D translation utilizing the ground-truth object bounding box and approximate 3D rotation with a large number of discrete hypotheses. This strategy makes unrealistic assumptions about the availability of ground truth and incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we rethink the problem of relative pose estimation for unseen objects by presenting a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet++). Our method computes the relative object pose in a single pass, eliminating the need for ground-truth object bounding boxes and rotation hypotheses. We achieve open-set object detection by leveraging image feature embedding and natural language understanding as reference. The detection result is then employed to approximate the translation parameters and crop the object from the query image. For rotation estimation, we map the two RGB images, i.e., reference and cropped query, to their respective voxelized 3D representations. The resulting voxels are passed through a rotation estimation module, which aligns the voxels and computes the rotation in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, Objaverse, LINEMOD, and LINEMOD-O datasets, demonstrating that our approach delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/sailor-z/DVMNet/.",

      "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction. However, data distribution of speech signals varies among individuals for emotion recognition. It may guide models to focus more on identity information rather than emotional information, which impairs the generalization ability of models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Disentanglement Network (DTNet) to disentangle emotional features from acoustic features. Specifically, DTNet first captures hidden identity features from acoustic features through an identity-aware module. Then, we design a disentanglement module to disentangle emotional features from acoustic features within the constraints of a reconstruction module and the hidden identity features. These modules enable the DTNet to extract more discriminative emotional features for emotion recognition. Experimental results on both speaker-independent and speaker-dependent settings have proven the effectiveness of DTNet, and this method achieves an unweighted accuracy (UA) of 74.8% on the IEMOCAP dataset and UA of 95.5% on the Emo-DB dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.",

      "abstract": "Cross-subject EEG emotion recognition suffers a major setback due to high inter-subject variability in emotional responses. Many prior studies have endeavored to alleviate the inter-subject discrepancies of EEG feature distributions, ignoring the variable EEG connectivity and prediction deviation caused by individual differences, which may cause poor generalization to the unseen subject. This paper proposes a graph domain disentanglement network (GDDN) to generalize EEG emotion recognition across subjects in terms of EEG connectivity, representation, and prediction. More specifically, a graph domain disentanglement module is proposed to extract common-specific characteristics on both EEG graph connectivity and graph representation, enabling a more comprehensive network transferability to the unseen individual. Meanwhile, to strengthen stable emotion prediction capability, a domain-adaptive classifier aggregation module is developed to facilitate adaptive emotional prediction for the unseen individual conditioned on the domain weights of the input individuals. Finally, an auxiliary supervision module is imposed to alleviate the domain discrepancy and reduce information loss during the disentanglement learning. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED, validate the superior generalizability of GDDN compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Commonsense knowledge graph completion is a new challenge for commonsense knowledge graph construction and application. In contrast to factual knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO, commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs; e.g., ConceptNet) utilize free-form text to represent named entities, short phrases, and events as their nodes. Such a loose structure results in large and sparse CSKGs, which makes the semantic understanding of these nodes more critical for learning rich commonsense knowledge graph embedding. While current methods leverage semantic similarities to increase the graph density, the semantic plausibility of the nodes and their relations are under-explored. Previous works adopt conceptual abstraction to improve the consistency of modeling (event) plausibility, but they are not scalable enough and still suffer from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose to adopt textual entailment to find implicit entailment relations between CSKG nodes, to effectively densify the subgraph connecting nodes within the same conceptual class, which indicates a similar level of plausibility. Each node in CSKG finds its top entailed nodes using a finetuned transformer over natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which sufficiently capture textual entailment signals. The entailment relation between these nodes are further utilized to: 1) build new connections between source triplets and entailed nodes to densify the sparse CSKGs; 2) enrich the generalization ability of node representations by comparing the node embeddings with a contrastive loss. Experiments on two standard CSKGs demonstrate that our proposed framework EntailE can improve the performance of CSKG completion tasks under both transductive and inductive settings.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is a widely used technology in both affective dialogue bots and dialogue recommendation scenarios, where motivating a system to correctly recognize human emotions is crucial. Uncovering as much contextual information as possible with a limited amount of dialogue information is essential for eventually identifying the correct emotion of each sentence. The integration of contextual information using the existing approaches often results in inadequate access to information or information redundancy. Deeply integrating the different knowledge behind utterances is also difficult. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a dynamic complementary graph convolutional network (DCGCN) for conversational emotion recognition. Our approach uses commonsense knowledge to complement the contextual information contained in utterances and enrich the extracted conversation information. We creatively propose the concept of utterance density to prevent redundancy and the loss of utterance information in context-dependent contextual information modeling cases. An utterance dependency structure is dynamically determined by the utterance density, and the contextual information is fully integrated into each sentence representation. We evaluate our proposed model in extensive experiments conducted on four public benchmark datasets that are commonly used for ERC. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCGCN, which achieves competitive results in terms of well-known evaluation metrics.

      "abstract": "EEG emotion recognition has been hampered by the clear individual differences in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Nowadays, domain adaptation is a good way to deal with this issue because it aligns the distribution of data across subjects. However, the performance for EEG emotion recognition is limited by the existing research, which mainly focuses on the global alignment between the source domain and the target domain and ignores much fine-grained information. In this study, we propose a method called Graph-based Unsupervised Subdomain Adaptation (Gusa), which simultaneously aligns the distribution between the source and target domains in a fine-grained way from both the channel and emotion subdomains. Gusa employs three modules, such as the Node-wise Domain Constraints Module to align each EEG channel and obtain a domain-variant representation, the Class-level Distribution Constraints Module, and the Emotion-wise Domain Constraints Module, to collect more fine-grained information, create more discriminative representations for each emotion, and lessen the impact of noisy emotion labels. The studies on the SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets demonstrate that Gusa significantly improves the ability of EEG to recognize emotions and can extract more granular and discriminative representations for EEG.",

      "abstract": "Open-domain Question Answering (OpenQA) aims at answering factual questions with an external large-scale knowledge corpus. However, real-world knowledge is not static; it updates and evolves continually. Such a dynamic characteristic of knowledge poses a vital challenge for these models, as the trained models need to constantly adapt to the latest information to make sure that the answers remain accurate. In addition, it is still unclear how well an OpenQA model can transfer to completely new knowledge domains. In this paper, we investigate the generalization performance of a retrieval-augmented QA model in two specific scenarios: 1) adapting to updated versions of the same knowledge corpus; 2) switching to completely different knowledge domains. We observe that the generalization challenges of OpenQA models stem from the reader's over-reliance on memorizing the knowledge from the external corpus, which hinders the model from generalizing to a new knowledge corpus. We introduce Corpus-Invariant Tuning (CIT), a simple but effective training strategy, to mitigate the knowledge over-memorization by controlling the likelihood of retrieved contexts during training. Extensive experimental results on multiple OpenQA benchmarks show that CIT achieves significantly better generalizability without compromising the model's performance in its original corpus and domain.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual case and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. We show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive hallucination detection performance when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4. Furthermore, the finetuned model can effectively mitigate hallucination in LLM responses.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous domains with their impressive performance but still face their challenges. A predominant issue is the propensity for these models to generate non-existent facts, a concern termed hallucination. Our research is motivated by the observation that previous instruction tuning methods force the model to complete a sentence no matter whether the model knows the knowledge or not. When the question is out of the parametric knowledge, it will try to make up something and fail to indicate when it lacks knowledge. In this paper, we present a new approach called Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (R-Tuning). This approach is formalized by first identifying the disparity in knowledge encompassed by pre-trained parameters compared to that of instruction tuning data. Then, we construct the refusal-aware data based on the knowledge intersection, to tune LLMs to refrain from responding to questions beyond its parametric knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate R-Tuning effectively improves a model’s ability to answer known questions and refrain from answering unknown questions. Furthermore, when tested on out-of-domain datasets, the refusal ability was found to be a meta-skill that could be generalized to other tasks. Further analysis surprisingly finds that learning the uncertainty results in better calibration and an improved ability to estimate the uncertainty than uncertainty-based testing.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing novel sub-categories with scarce samples is an essential and challenging research topic in computer vision. Existing literature addresses this challenge by employing local-based representation approaches, which may not sufficiently facilitate meaningful object-specific semantic understanding, leading to a reliance on apparent background correlations. Moreover, they primarily rely on high-dimensional local descriptors to construct complex embedding space, potentially limiting the generalization. To address the above challenges, this article proposes a novel model, Robust Saliency-aware Distillation (RSaD), for few-shot fine-grained visual recognition. RSaD introduces additional saliency-aware supervision via saliency detection to guide the model toward focusing on the intrinsic discriminative regions. Specifically, RSaD utilizes the saliency detection model to emphasize the critical regions of each sub-category, providing additional object-specific information for fine-grained prediction. RSaD transfers such information with two symmetric branches in a mutual learning paradigm. Furthermore, RSaD exploits inter-regional relationships to enhance the informativeness of the representation and subsequently summarize the highlighted details into contextual embeddings to facilitate the effective transfer, enabling quick generalization to novel sub-categories. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated on three widely used benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.",

      "abstract": "Bearing fault diagnosis is essential for improving the efficiency of industrial operations. The inherently multi-modal nature of bearing vibration signals presents significant challenges in bearing fault diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Channel Broad Learning System (MCBLS). MCBLS comprises multiple Broad Learning Systems (BLSs) and incorporates aPositive-Negative Weighted Voting mechanism (PNWV). MCBLS first employs empirical mode decomposition to break down the vibration signal into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and subsequently transforms these IMFs into concise spectrogram distributions (CSDs). Following this, MCBLS employs multiple BLSs, with each one being trained based on a CSD associated with an IMF. The final diagnosis result is obtained by aggregating all BLSs' outcomes using the PNWV. To validate MCBLS, we employ three bearing fault datasets collected from Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, China (GDUPT), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Southeast University, China (SEU). The accuracies of MCBLS in three datasets can reach up to 98.11%, 100%, and 94.33% respectively, demonstrating its superior classification performance and applicable generalization for bearing fault diagnosis.",

With a resolution exceeding 2750 pixels per inch, the multiscale colloidal nanostructure patterns on a 4‐inch wafer yield diverse optical images when subjected to various light excitations. This cover artwork highlights multi‐modal optical anti‐counterfeiting enabled by structural patterns at hierarchical length scales. [Image: see text]",

In this paper, we propose a dense convolutional network lane detection based on attention mechanism. The algorithm adopts DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network) as the backbone network to capture global features and improve detection accuracy. In addition, CBAM is utilized to enhance the perception of lane details. Moreover, an auxiliary training network is designed where Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) is employed to obtain multi-scale feature representations for handling lanes in various sizes and shapes. Our algorithm effectively addresses the issues of efficiency and challenging scenarios like no-visual cues. Experiments on public data sets show that the detection accuracy of our proposed algorithm improves to 96.9% compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, especially under complex lighting conditions.",

      "abstract": "Network digital twin is a key enabler for the human-centric wireless metaverse, requiring fine-grained replication, high-fidelity screen rendering, and the integration of emerging intelligent technologies. However, existing frameworks for the network digital twin overlook the integration of human-centric features within the metaverse and the importance of asynchronous data collection, both of which are indispensable for actualizing the metaverse and attaining self-maintenance capabilities. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a human-centric framework and a self-maintained mechanism for the network digital twin, utilizing continuous prediction and error tolerance to enhance the performance of DT decision-making. Specifically, by considering the interplay among different components, we present a human-centric framework for the network digital twin, comprising the device twin layer, network twin layer, artificial intelligence service layer, and user intent layer. In consideration of asynchronous information, we propose a self-maintenance mechanism facilitated by two key capabilities: error tolerance and continuous prediction. Furthermore, we conduct a resource allocation experiment to validate the efficiency of the proposed framework and methods. The results demonstrate that the framework reduce latency by employing request prediction and robust optimization.",

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in various decision-crucial fields, where accurate predictions with high interpretability are desired. Thus, numerous post-hoc explainers for GNNs have been proposed. However, some prioritize human-intelligible explanations through graph rules, such as the connection rule, which undermines the explanation's faithfulness to the model. This paper proposes an innovative method, FACExplainer, that re-examines the role of spatial information within GNNs for generating model-faithful explanations. FACExplainer employs activation maps from the last graph convolution to narrow down a compact search space. Our approach further identifies the subgraph that maximizes mutual information as the explanation, eliminating the need for domain-specific knowledge about the downstream task. Empirical analysis of FACExplainer on seven benchmark datasets with three classical GNNs reveals significantly improved explanation quality while consuming less time when compared to leading explainers. The source code of FACExplainer is freely available at https://github.com/HuaYangttt/Facexplainer/.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), as an indispensable tool for exploring the ocean, has developed rapidly in recent years. With the gradual deepening of people's exploration of the ocean, a single underwater vehicle detection range and detection capacity are limited to meet large-scale and long-term operational requirements. Therefore, the coordinated operation of the multi-AUV has become an important direction for the development of underwater vehicles. The precise navigation result is the premise of the AUV cluster execution task. A multi-AUV collaborative navigation method based on flexible fusion ideas is proposed for sensor failures caused by complex underwater environments and the interruption of water acoustic communication. Flexible fusion refers to the elastic selection of suitable sensor groups according to different operational conditions and different operational tasks under the premise of ensuring cluster navigation accuracy, and the weighted fusion of data based on the principle of minimizing navigation errors to avoid navigation accuracy degradation due to insufficient sensor accuracy or failure.",

      "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising approach for learning reinforced policies from offline datasets without the need for costly or unsafe interactions with the environment. However, datasets collected by humans in real-world environments are often noisy and may even be maliciously corrupted, which can significantly degrade the performance of offline RL. In this work, we first investigate the performance of current offline RL algorithms under comprehensive data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics. Our extensive experiments reveal that implicit Q-learning (IQL) demonstrates remarkable resilience to data corruption among various offline RL algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct both empirical and theoretical analyses to understand IQL's robust performance, identifying its supervised policy learning scheme as the key factor. Despite its relative robustness, IQL still suffers from heavy-tail targets of Q functions under dynamics corruption. To tackle this challenge, we draw inspiration from robust statistics to employ the Huber loss to handle the heavy-tailedness and utilize quantile estimators to balance penalization for corrupted data and learning stability. By incorporating these simple yet effective modifications into IQL, we propose a more robust offline RL approach named Robust IQL (RIQL). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIQL exhibits highly robust performance when subjected to diverse data corruption scenarios.",

      "abstract": "<p indent=\"0mm\">The accuracy of grape picking point localization relies on the performance of grape detection and semantic segmentation network. However, in practical application scenarios, the accuracy and segmentation precision of grape targets based on visible light images are susceptible to light variations and complex environments, often resulting in poor performance. Moreover, grapes grow in bunches, and the existing multimodal datasets for apples and pears may not adequately fulfill the recognition needs of bunch-shaped grapes. The construction of a dataset of grape multimodal object detection and semantic segmentation based on visible light, depth, and near-infrared multimodal object detection and semantic segmentation is crucial to exploring better recognition rates and stronger generalization capabilities for grape detection and semantic segmentation models. This dataset, totaling about 39.08 GB, contains high-quality multimodal video stream data of green and purple grapes, including six varieties captured under different illumination and obscuration conditions. Additionally, the dataset offers 3,954 labeled image samples extracted from the aforementioned multimodal video stream. Using techniques such as rotation, deflation, mis-slicing, panning, and Gaussian blur, the dataset can be augmented for the training implementation of mainstream deep learning models. The dataset can provide valuable basic data resources for multimodal fusion, grape semantic segmentation, and object detection, and have important practical application value for promoting research in the field of agricultural machinery and equipment intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Modern deep learning heavily relies on large labeled datasets, which often comse with high costs in terms of both manual labeling and computational resources. To mitigate these challenges, researchers have explored the use of informative subset selection techniques, including coreset selection and active learning. Specifically, coreset selection involves sampling data with both input ($\\bx$) and output ($\\by$), active learning focuses solely on the input data ($\\bx$). In this study, we present a theoretically optimal solution for addressing both coreset selection and active learning within the context of linear softmax regression. Our proposed method, COPS (unCertainty based OPtimal Sub-sampling), is designed to minimize the expected loss of a model trained on subsampled data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on explicit calculations of the inverse covariance matrix, which are not easily applicable to deep learning scenarios, COPS leverages the model's logits to estimate the sampling ratio. This sampling ratio is closely associated with model uncertainty and can be effectively applied to deep learning tasks. Furthermore, we address the challenge of model sensitivity to misspecification by incorporating a down-weighting approach for low-density samples, drawing inspiration from previous works. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted extensive empirical experiments using deep neural networks on benchmark datasets. The results consistently showcase the superior performance of COPS compared to baseline methods, reaffirming its efficacy.",

      "abstract": "This study is aimed to design a fault-tolerant control using a broad learning neural network (BLNN) for a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) nonlinear helicopter system. Compared with the conventional radial basis function neural network, the BLNN can approximate uncertainties and unknown functions with smaller tracking errors by adding incremental and enhancement nodes. Considering possible actuator faults in during actual application, an adaptive auxiliary parameter is established to prevent their effects on control. Through direct Lyapunov method, the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are analyzed. The results from simulations and experiments conducted on a 2-DOF helicopter laboratory platform of Quanser demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed control method.",

      "abstract": "With increasing social globalization, interaction between people from different cultures has become more frequent. However, there are significant differences in the expression and comprehension of emotions across cultures. Therefore, developing computational models that can accurately identify emotions among different cultures has become a significant research problem. This study aims to investigate the similarities and differences in emotion cognition processes in different cultural groups by employing a fusion of electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement (EM) signals. Specifically, an effective adaptive region selection method is proposed to investigate the most emotion-related activated brain regions in different groups. By selecting these commonly activated regions, we can eliminate redundant features and facilitate the development of portable acquisition devices. Subsequently, the multiple stacked broad learning system (MSBLS) is designed to explore the complementary information of EEG and EM features and the effective emotional information still contained in the residual value. The intracultural subject-dependent (ICSD), intracultural subject-independent, and cross-cultural subject-independent (CCSI) experiments have been conducted on the SEED-CHN, SEED-GER, and SEED-FRA datasets. Extensive experiments manifest that MSBLS achieves superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we discover that some brain regions (the anterior frontal, temporal, and middle parieto-occipital lobes) and Gamma frequency bands show greater activation during emotion cognition in diverse cultural groups.",

      "abstract": "In the process of graphic layout generation, user specifications including element attributes and their relationships are commonly used to constrain the layouts (e.g.,\"put the image above the button''). It is natural to encode spatial constraints between elements using a graph. This paper presents a two-stage generation framework: a spatial graph generator and a subsequent layout decoder which is conditioned on the previous output graph. Training the two highly dependent networks separately as in previous work, we observe that the graph generator generates out-of-distribution graphs with a high frequency, which are unseen to the layout decoder during training and thus leads to huge performance drop in inference. To coordinate the two networks more effectively, we propose a novel collaborative generation strategy to perform round-way knowledge transfer between the networks in both training and inference. Experiment results on three public datasets show that our model greatly benefits from the collaborative generation and has achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis to better understand the effectiveness of graph condition modeling.",

More and more researchers use text classification methods to identify law-related public opinion information. However, the existing text classification methods rely on labor-intensive feature engineering, and their performance mainly depends on information fusion and classification algorithms, which is unsuitable for rapidly developing fields. This paper extracts the user comments of a hunting forum to analyze the semantic information of argot and employs the Word2vec model to represent the argot feature. Combining the multi-layer information of the pre-trained BERT on the user comments, we propose a text classification method BERT_W2V_CRF to improve the classification efficiency of massive law-related public opinion texts. Specifically, we first build a terminology dictionary of Chinese hunting forum to identify the argot features in expert-marked data using the Word2vec model. Then the BERT model is pretrained and the representation of fused information is generated by combining the Word2vec and optimized BERT. Finally, the recognized result is obtained by using Softmax. Experiments are conducted on the user comment dataset to evaluate the proposed text classification method, and the results show that the information fusion approach can be used to improve the classification efficiency of the deep learning-based method.",

      "abstract": "Aims Integrating bioinformatics and experimental validation to explore the mechanisms of inflammaging in the Brain. Method After dividing the GSE11882 dataset into aged and young groups, we identified co-expressed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different brain regions. Enrichment analysis revealed that the co-expressed DEGs were mainly associated with inflammatory responses. Subsequently, we identified 12 DEGs that were related to the inflammatory response and used the DGIdb website for drug prediction. By using both the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF), four biomarkers were screened and an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed for diagnosis. Subsequently, the biomarkers were validated through animal studies. Then we utilized AgeAnno to investigate the roles of biomarkers at the single cell level. Next, a consensus clustering approach was used to classify the aging samples and perform differential analysis to identify inflammatory response-related genes. After conducting a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified the genes that are correlated with both four brain regions and aging. Wayne diagrams were used to identify seven inflammaging-related genes in different brain regions. Finally, we performed immuno-infiltration analysis and identified macrophage module genes. Key findings Inflammaging may be a major mechanism of brain aging, and the regulation of macrophages by CX3CL1 may play a role in the development of inflammaging. Significance In summary, targeting CX3CL1 can potentially delay inflammaging and immunosenescence in the brain.",

      "abstract": "EEG emotion recognition plays a significant role in various mental health services. Deep learning-based methods perform excellently, but still suffer from interpretability. Although methods such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM) can cope with the above problem, their coarse granularity cannot accurately reveal the mechanism to promote emotional intelligence. In this paper, fine-grained interpretability is proposed, called Concat-aided Grad-CAM. Specifically, the multi-level feature mapping before the fully connected layer is concatenated to obtain the gradients of the target concept so that the discriminant information can be directly located in the high-precision area. Unlike coarse-grained interpretability methods applied in EEG emotion recognition, it can accurately highlight the EEG channels related to emotion rather than an obscure area. In addition, a systematic brain functional network is proposed to reveal the relationship between those channels and to further improve emotion recognition performance. The channels with greater contributions are connected, and those connections are learned by dynamic graph convolutional networks, while the others are independent to eliminate interference. Experiments on two EEG emotion recognition datasets manifest that Concat-aided Grad-CAM can be interpreted by the fine-grained. In addition, it has been shown that the learned brain functional network can improve the performance of the baselines. Significantly, the experiment results achieve state-of-the-art performance in subject-dependent experiments.",

      "abstract": "Robots rely heavily on sensors, especially RGB and depth cameras, to perceive and interact with the world. RGB cameras record 2D images with rich semantic information while missing precise spatial information. On the other side, depth cameras offer critical 3D geometry data but capture limited semantics. Therefore, integrating both modalities is crucial for learning representations for robotic perception and control. However, current research predominantly focuses on only one of these modalities, neglecting the benefits of incorporating both. To this end, we present $\\textbf{Semantic-Geometric Representation} (\\textbf{SGR})$, a universal perception module for robotics that leverages the rich semantic information of large-scale pre-trained 2D models and inherits the merits of 3D spatial reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that SGR empowers the agent to successfully complete a diverse range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly in both single-task and multi-task settings. Furthermore, SGR possesses the capability to generalize to novel semantic attributes, setting it apart from the other methods. Project website: https://semantic-geometric-representation.github.io.",

Focusing on the stochastic nature of training, we first present a theoretical analysis in which the bound of generalization gap depends on what we call inconsistency and instability of model outputs, which can be estimated on unlabeled data. Our empirical study based on this analysis shows that instability and inconsistency are strongly predictive of generalization gap in various settings. In particular, our finding indicates that inconsistency is a more reliable indicator of generalization gap than the sharpness of the loss landscape. Furthermore, we show that algorithmic reduction of inconsistency leads to superior performance. The results also provide a theoretical basis for existing methods such as co-distillation and ensemble.",

      "abstract": "Offline goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) offers a way to train general-purpose agents from fully offline datasets. In addition to being conservative within the dataset, the generalization ability to achieve unseen goals is another fundamental challenge for offline GCRL. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been well studied yet. In this paper, we study out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of offline GCRL both theoretically and empirically to identify factors that are important. In a number of experiments, we observe that weighted imitation learning enjoys better generalization than pessimism-based offline RL method. Based on this insight, we derive a theory for OOD generalization, which characterizes several important design choices. We then propose a new offline GCRL method, Generalizable Offline goAl-condiTioned RL (GOAT), by combining the findings from our theoretical and empirical studies. On a new benchmark containing 9 independent identically distributed (IID) tasks and 17 OOD tasks, GOAT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "Image outpainting is a challenge for image processing since it needs to produce a big scenery image from a few patches. In general, two-stage frameworks are utilized to unpack complex tasks and complete them step-by-step. However, the time consumption caused by training two networks will hinder the method from adequately optimizing the parameters of networks with limited iterations. In this article, a broad generative network (BG-Net) for two-stage image outpainting is proposed. As a reconstruction network in the first stage, it can be quickly trained by utilizing ridge regression optimization. In the second stage, a seam line discriminator (SLD) is designed for transition smoothing, which greatly improves the quality of images. Compared with state-of-the-art image outpainting methods, the experimental results on the Wiki-Art and Place365 datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best results under evaluation metrics: the Fréchet inception distance (FID) and the kernel inception distance (KID). The proposed BG-Net has good reconstructive ability with faster training speed than those of deep learning-based networks. It reduces the overall training duration of the two-stage framework to the same level as the one-stage framework. Furthermore, the proposed method is adapted to image recurrent outpainting, demonstrating the powerful associative drawing capability of the model.",

Firstly, the noises in observed GNSS are suppressed using the UKF algorithm. Then, an image/GNSS multi-modal fusion deep auto-encoder network is built with hybrid \"unsupervised/self-supervised\" learning mechanism. The deep auto-encoder fusion network is trained taking the noise-suppressed GNSS as the auxiliary supervised information to gain the high-precision localization capability from multi-modal fusion. The proposed method is compared with five classical/ state-of-the-art methods in simulation experiments. The results show that the proposed method effectively improved the aircraft positioning accuracy and stability, and the positioning accuracy was improved by 53.31% in average.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning generally suffers from enormous computational resources and time-consuming training processes. Broad Learning System (BLS) and its convolutional variants have been proposed to mitigate these issues and have achieved superb performance in image classification. However, the existing convolutional-based broad learning system (C-BLS) either lacks an efficient training method and incremental learning capability or suffers from poor performance. To this end, we propose a convolutional broad learning system (ConvBLS) based on the spherical K-means (SKM) algorithm and two-stage multi-scale (TSMS) feature fusion, which consists of the convolutional feature (CF) layer, convolutional enhancement (CE) layer, TSMS feature fusion layer, and output layer. First, unlike the current C-BLS, the simple yet efficient SKM algorithm is utilized to learn the weights of CF layers. Compared with random filters, the SKM algorithm makes the CF layer learn more comprehensive spatial features. Second, similar to the vanilla BLS, CE layers are established to expand the feature space. Third, the TSMS feature fusion layer is proposed to extract more effective multi-scale features through the integration of CF layers and CE layers. Thanks to the above design and the pseudo-inverse calculation of the output layer weights, our proposed ConvBLS method is unprecedentedly efficient and effective. Finally, the corresponding incremental learning algorithms are presented for rapid remodeling if the model deems to expand. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

      "abstract": "Passive location technology has been greatly developed because of its low power consumption, long detection distance, good concealment, and strong anti-interference ability. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is an efficient multi-carrier transmission technology, which is an important signal form of 5G communication. Researching passive locations for OFDM signals can realize the location of base stations, which is of great significance in the military. Space-borne passive location technology has a contradiction between wide coverage and high precision. Therefore, a single-satellite passive location algorithm for OFDM radiation sources based on the virtual synthetic aperture is proposed. The algorithm introduces virtual synthetic aperture technology, using antenna movement to accumulate data coherently over a long time period and synthesizing a long azimuth virtual aperture. In addition, it utilizes fast Fourier transform (FFT) to extract phase information at a specific frequency based on the multi-carrier modulation technology of the OFDM signal. Pilot technology of the communication system is used for phase compensation and noise reduction. Thus, the azimuth linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal containing the location information of the radiation source is obtained. The radiation source location can be obtained by range searching and azimuth focusing. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and show that the algorithm can realize high-precision and wide-coverage location for the OFDM radiation sources using a single antenna, turning the hardware structure into software to reduce the cost and complexity of the system.",

      "abstract": "When a multi-modal affective analysis model generalizes from a bimodal task to a trimodal or multi-modal task, it is usually transformed into a hierarchical fusion model based on every two pairwise modalities, similar to a binary tree structure. This easily leads to large growth in model parameters and computation as the number of modalities increases, which limits the model's generalization. Moreover, many multi-modal fusion methods ignore that different modalities contribute differently to affective analysis. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a general multi-modal fusion model that supports trimodal or multi-modal affective analysis tasks, called Multi-modal Interactive Attention Network (MIA-Net). Instead of treating different modalities equally, MIA-Net takes the modality that contributes the most to emotion as the main modality and the others as auxiliary modalities. MIA-Net introduces multi-modal interactive attention modules to adaptively select the important information of each auxiliary modality one by one to improve the main-modal representation. Moreover, MIA-Net enables quick generalization to trimodal or multi-modal tasks through stacking multiple MIA modules, which maintains efficient training and only requires linear computation and stable parameter counts. Experimental results of the transfer, generalization, and efficiency experiments on the widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Cement has been widely used in civil engineering directly and plays a critical role in cement-based materials, e.g., concrete. As the microstructural evolution of cement hydration predominates the final physical properties, an accurate simulation of hydration is highly required to enable scientists to evaluate the performance and help design new cementitious materials. However, despite significant effort and progress, a satisfactory model to realistically and accurately simulate the evolution of three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure has not yet to be constructed, mainly because cement hydration is one of the most complex phenomena in material science. In this work, a novel near-realistic microstructural model is proposed to simulate the cement hydration system using deep learning and cellular automata. It is designed to break through the bottleneck of fidelity to real microstructural evolution. The dynamical system is constructed based on a 3-D cellular automaton, in which behavior is controlled by deep neural networks distilled from microstructural images. In addition, a dynamic stratified sampling method with variable capacity is proposed to ensure the representativeness of samples for reducing the computation cost of training. Experiments manifest that the simulated hydration is in accordance with the actual development in different aspects, such as near-realistic microstructure and approximate process. Furthermore, the constructed system also demonstrates promising generalization capability even under various conditions.",

      "abstract": "The core idea of cross-domain recommendation is to alleviate the problem of data scarcity. Previous methods have made brilliant successes. However, many of them mainly focus on learning an ideal mapping function across-domains, ignoring the user preferences within a specific domain, which leads to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Domain Recommendation Variational AutoEncoder framework (CDRVAE), a novel extension of a variational autoencoder on cross-domain recommendations for user behaviour distribution modeling. It applies a new hybrid architecture of VAE as the backbone and simultaneously constructs two information flows, within-domain and cross-domain modeling. For the former, an asymmetric codec structure is designed to reconstruct preference distribution from domain-specific latent factors. To relieve the posterior collapse dilemma, a combined prior is employed to increase the distribution complexity. The equivalent transition by a transformation matrix and the unobserved interaction generation by cross-domain reconstruction contribute to the latter. We combine all the above components for the more accurate and reliable user features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CDRVAE. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRVAE is consistently superior to other state-of-the-art alternative baseline models.",

      "abstract": "The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) brings emergent abilities to various complex tasks requiring reasoning, such as arithmetic and commonsense reasoning. It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers. In particular, an effective approach for complex question-and-answer tasks is example-based prompting with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which significantly improves the performance of LLMs. However, current CoT methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars, which are not necessarily the most effective examples for different tasks. This paper proposes a new method, Active-Prompt, to adapt LLMs to different tasks with task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning). For this purpose, we propose a solution to the key problem of determining which questions are the most important and helpful ones to annotate from a pool of task-specific queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art on eight complex reasoning tasks. Further analyses of different uncertainty metrics, pool sizes, zero-shot learning, and accuracy-uncertainty relationship demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      "abstract": "Autonomous exploration is a widely studied fundamental application in the field of quadrotors, which requires them to automatically explore unknown space to obtain complete information about the environment. The frontier-based method, which is one of the representative works on autonomous exploration, drives autonomous determination by the definition of frontier information, so that complete information about the environment is available to the quadrotor. However, existing frontier-based methods are able to accomplish the task but still suffer from inefficient exploration. How to improve the efficiency of autonomous exploration is the focus of current research. Typical problems include slow frontier generation, which affects real-time viewpoint determination, and insufficient determination methods that affect the quality of viewpoints. Therefore, to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a two-level viewpoint determination method for frontier-based autonomous exploration. Firstly, a sampling-based frontier detection method is presented for faster frontier generation, which improves the immediacy of environmental representation compared to traditional traversal-based methods. Secondly, we consider the access to environmental information during flight for the first time and design an innovative heuristic evaluation function to decide on a high-quality viewpoint as the next local navigation target in each exploration iteration. We conducted extensive benchmark and real-world tests to validate our method. The results confirm that our method optimizes the frontier search time by 85%, the exploration time by around 20-30%, and the exploration path by 25-35%.",

      "abstract": "Social media classification tasks (e.g., tweet sentiment analysis, tweet stance detection) are challenging because social media posts are typically short, informal, and ambiguous. Thus, training on tweets is challenging and demands large-scale human-annotated labels, which are time-consuming and costly to obtain. In this paper, we find that providing hashtags to social media tweets can help alleviate this issue because hashtags can enrich short and ambiguous tweets in terms of various information, such as topic, sentiment, and stance. This motivates us to propose a novel Hashtag-guided Tweet Classification model (HashTation), which automatically generates meaningful hashtags for the input tweet to provide useful auxiliary signals for tweet classification. To generate high-quality and insightful hashtags, our hashtag generation model retrieves and encodes the post-level and entity-level information across the whole corpus. Experiments show that HashTation achieves significant improvements on seven low-resource tweet classification tasks, in which only a limited amount of training data is provided, showing that automatically enriching tweets with model-generated hashtags could significantly reduce the demand for large-scale human-labeled data. Further analysis demonstrates that HashTation is able to generate high-quality hashtags that are consistent with the tweets and their labels. The code is available at https://github.com/shizhediao/HashTation.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies estimate human anatomical key points through the single monocular image, in which multichannel heatmaps are the key factor in determining the quality of human pose estimation. Multichannel heatmaps can efficiently handle the image-to-coordinate mapping task and the processing of semantic features. Most methods ignore physical constraints and internal relationships of human body parts, which easily misclassify left and right symmetrical parts as similar features. Some studies use RNNs on the top to incorporate priors about the structure of pose components and body configuration. Therefore, a novel top-down convolutional network is proposed to consider these priors during training, which can improve the robustness under complex field conditions in the wild. In order to learn the prior knowledge of human pose configuration, the hierarchy of fully convolutional networks (discriminator) is used to distinguish real poses from fake ones. Consequently, the pose network is inclined to make a pose estimation that the discriminator misjudges as true, which is reasonable in complex situations. The performance of the method is experimentally validated by pose estimation on the MS COCO human key point detection task. The proposed approach outperforms the original method and generates robust pose predictions, demonstrating efficiency by using adversarial learning.",

      "abstract": "POMDPs capture a broad class of decision making problems, but hardness results suggest that learning is intractable even in simple settings due to the inherent partial observability. However, in many realistic problems, more information is either revealed or can be computed during some point of the learning process. Motivated by diverse applications ranging from robotics to data center scheduling, we formulate a Hindsight Observable Markov Decision Process (HOMDP) as a POMDP where the latent states are revealed to the learner in hindsight and only during training. We introduce new algorithms for the tabular and function approximation settings that are provably sample-efficient with hindsight observability, even in POMDPs that would otherwise be statistically intractable. We give a lower bound showing that the tabular algorithm is optimal in its dependence on latent state and observation cardinalities.",

Although continued pre-training on a large domain-specific corpus is effective, it is costly to tune all the parameters on the domain. In this paper, we investigate whether we can adapt PLMs both effectively and efficiently by only tuning a few parameters. Specifically, we decouple the feed-forward networks (FFNs) of the Transformer architecture into two parts: the original pre-trained FFNs to maintain the old-domain knowledge and our novel domain-specific adapters to inject domain-specific knowledge in parallel. Then we adopt a mixture-of-adapters gate to fuse the knowledge from different domain adapters dynamically. Our proposed Mixture-of-Domain-Adapters (MixDA) employs a two-stage adapter-tuning strategy that leverages both unlabeled data and labeled data to help the domain adaptation: i) domain-specific adapter on unlabeled data; followed by ii) the task-specific adapter on labeled data. MixDA can be seamlessly plugged into the pretraining-finetuning paradigm and our experiments demonstrate that MixDA achieves superior performance on in-domain tasks (GLUE), out-of-domain tasks (ChemProt, RCT, IMDB, Amazon), and knowledge-intensive tasks (KILT). Further analyses demonstrate the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of our method.",

      "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) advances the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and achieves superior performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most CoT studies rely on carefully designed human-annotated rational chains to prompt LLMs, posing challenges for real-world applications where labeled data is available without rational chains. This paper proposes a new strategy, Automate-CoT (Automatic Prompt Augmentation and Selection with Chain-of-Thought), that can bypass human engineering of CoT by automatically augmenting rational chains from a small labeled dataset, and then pruning low-quality chains to construct a candidate pool of machine-generated rationale chains based on the labels. Finally, it selects the optimal combination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting by employing a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to estimate the significance of each example. Automate-CoT enables a quick adaptation of the CoT technique to different tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where competitive results are achieved on arithmetic reasoning (+2.7%), commonsense reasoning (+3.4%), symbolic reasoning (+3.2%), and non-reasoning tasks (+2.5%).",

      "abstract": "Improving the quality of academic writing is a meaningful but challenging task. Conventional methods of language refinement focus on narrow, specific linguistic features within isolated sentences, such as grammatical errors and improper word use. We propose a more general task, Academic Writing Formalization (AWF), to improve the overall quality of formal academic writing at the paragraph level. We formulate this language refinement task as a formal text style transfer task which transfers informal-academic text to formal-academic and contribute a large-scale non-parallel dataset, DOOLITTLE, for this purpose. Concurrently, we apply a method named metric-oriented reinforcement learning (MORL) to two pretrained language models (PLM) where we incorporate different levels of automatic feedback into the training process. Our experiments reveal that existing text transfer models and grammatical error correction models address certain aspects of AWF but still have a significant performance gap compared to human performance. Meanwhile, language models fine-tuned with our MORL method exhibit considerably improved performance, rivaling the latest chatbot ChatGPT, but still have a non-negligible gap compared to the ground truth formal-academic texts in DOOLITTLE.",

      "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown great prowess in learning topological relationships among electroencephalogram (EEG) channels for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, most existing GCN-only methods are designed with a single spatial pattern, lacking connectivity enhancement within local functional regions and ignoring the data dependencies of EEG original data. In this article, hierarchical dynamic GCN (HD-GCN) is proposed to explore dynamic multilevel spatial information among EEG channels, with discriminative features of EEG signals as auxiliary information. Specifically, representation learning in topological space consists of two branches: one for extracting global dynamic information and one for exploring augmentation information in local functional regions. In each branch, a layerwise adjacency matrix is utilized to enrich the expressive power of GCN. Furthermore, a data-dependent auxiliary information module (AIM) is developed to capture multidimensional fusion features. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and DREAMER, demonstrate that the proposed method consistently exceeds state-of-the-art methods. Interpretability analysis of the proposed model is performed, discovering the active brain regions and important electrode pairs related to emotion.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive interpretable ensemble model based on three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), i.e., 3DCNN+EL+GA, was proposed to differentiate the subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and further identify the discriminative brain regions significantly contributing to the classifications in a data-driven way. Plus, the discriminative brain sub-regions at a voxel level were further located in these achieved brain regions, with a gradient-based attribution method designed for CNN. Besides disclosing the discriminative brain sub-regions, the testing results on the datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) indicated that 3DCNN+EL+GA outperformed other state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and that the achieved discriminative brain regions (e.g., the rostral hippocampus, caudal hippocampus, and medial amygdala) were linked to emotion, memory, language, and other essential brain functions impaired early in the AD process. Future research is needed to examine the generalizability of the proposed method and ideas to discern discriminative brain regions for other brain disorders, such as severe depression, schizophrenia, autism, and cerebrovascular diseases, using neuroimaging.",

      "abstract": "Propagation delay and channel loss are two vital factors affecting reliability of Underwater Acoustic Networks (UANs). Different from land networks, UANs have long prop-agation delay and poor channel quality, which lead to serious data collision and high bit error rate, respectively. However, complex underwater environments impose great challenges to evaluate propagation delay and channel loss. As temperature is the most critical factor affecting them, in this paper, we propose to employ temperature to evaluate them. However, existing temperature prediction research are insufficient for accuracy or efficiency. This paper proposes a temperature prediction-assisted approach for evaluating propagation delay and channel loss, aiming to improve reliability and performance of underwater acoustic networks. We build a nonlinear autoregressive dynamic neural network-based temperature prediction model to improve prediction accuracy and reduce time complexity. Then, we evaluate propagation delay and channel loss considering different marine environments, including shallow and deep sea. Extensive simulation results show that our approach performs better than five advanced baselines.",

In this paper, we developed a large multimodal emotion dataset, named \"HED\" dataset, to facilitate the emotion recognition task, and accordingly propose a multimodal emotion recognition method. To promote recognition accuracy, \"Feature After Feature\" framework was used to explore crucial emotional information from the aligned face, body and text samples. We employ various benchmarks to evaluate the \"HED\" dataset and compare the performance with our method. The results show that the five classification accuracy of the proposed multimodal fusion method is about 83.75%, and the performance is improved by 1.83%, 9.38%, and 21.62% respectively compared with that of individual modalities. The complementarity between each channel is effectively used to improve the performance of emotion recognition. We had also established a multimodal online emotion prediction platform, aiming to provide free emotion prediction to more users.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep disturbance is often reported in children with autism spectrum disorder, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. In the current study 44 children with autism spectrum disorder and 44 with typical development were assessed via a sleep questionnaire and the Apple Watch. Neurotransmitter levels and clock gene mRNA levels were determined in all children. Children with autism spectrum disorder had a higher prevalence of sleep disturbance ( p &lt; 0.001) and had more sleep problems than children with typical development, including shorter total sleep time, lower sleep efficiency, and longer awake time (all p &lt; 0.001). Orexin levels ( p &lt; 0.001) and clock gene mRNA levels were lower in children with autism spectrum disorder (both p &lt; 0.05), and leptin levels were higher ( p = 0.034). These results demonstrate the importance of clock genes and neurotransmitters in the pathogenesis of sleep disturbance in children with autism spectrum disorder.

      "abstract": "As a key natural language processing (NLP) task, word sense disambiguation (WSD) evaluates how well NLP models can understand the lexical semantics of words under specific contexts. Benefited from the large-scale annotation, current WSD systems have achieved impressive performances in English by combining supervised learning with lexical knowledge. However, such success is hard to be replicated in other languages, where we only have limited annotations.In this paper, based on the multilingual lexicon BabelNet describing the same set of concepts across languages, we propose building knowledge and supervised-based Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (MWSD) systems. We build unified sense representations for multiple languages and address the annotation scarcity problem for MWSD by transferring annotations from rich-sourced languages to poorer ones. With the unified sense representations, annotations from multiple languages can be jointly trained to benefit the MWSD tasks. Evaluations of SemEval-13 and SemEval-15 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology.",

      "abstract": "With advances in deep learning methods and an enormous amount of network traffic data, training deep neural networks for malware traffic classification directly with the raw traffic data has gained popularity and success. Obtaining labeled data to train deeper models, on the other hand, has recently become a significant challenge. Weakly supervised learning approaches that aim to improve the classification accuracy of classifiers previously trained with a small quantity of labeled data using widely available but unlabeled data have grown more popular as a solution to this problem. We propose employing several deep models as labeling functions instead of manual definition based on hand-crafted features, such as Snorkel approach, to estimate the labels that will be utilized to tune the classifier to increase its accuracy for network traffic classification using unlabeled data. In a multi-class classification scenario, our findings demonstrate that utilizing deep models to label the unlabeled chunk can enhance accuracy by 1.5 % and F1-score by 5%.",

      "abstract": "In view of the current thermal safety and thermal balance of power lithium batteries, it takes the heat generation, heat transfer and heat dissipation of batteries as the main line, and uses the method of combining CFD simulation with experimental research to explore the application of expanded graphite based composite micro heat pipe coupling heat dissipation technology to BTMS. The reliability of the battery heat generation model is verified by experiments. The structure of the heat pipe is designed based on the phase change heat transfer and heat generation of the pipe. The CPCM heat transfer and micro heat pipe heat transfer models are coupled to form a hybrid BTMS numerical heat transfer model, and the optimal design of the system is carried out, so that the system mass is reduced by 15∼50%, the volume is reduced by 10∼50%, so as to prevent the battery temperature from being too high.Finally, a set of perfect BTMS thermal design, simulation analysis methods and processes are summarized, which provides a set of theoretical basis for the development and design of complex BTMS.",

      "abstract": "The different news clicked by users reflects the diverse interests of users. Most of the existing news recommendation methods do not consider the interaction with candidate news in the process of modeling user interest representation. This method makes it challenging to precisely match candidate news to specific user interests. We propose a user interest activation recommendation method that fuses multichannel information—MIAR. It utilizes the word embedding of the user's historical clicked news and the news title embedding generated by aggregation and interacts with the candidate news, respectively, to better match the candidate news with the user's interests. Our proposed method contains two frameworks (interactive framework and distributed framework). In the interactive framework, we propose a user multichannel interest modeling framework MIF from the word embedding level of news headlines to capture more semantic cues related to user interests. In the distributed framework, we design a candidate-aware interest activation module TAR from the news embedding representation level obtained by attention aggregation. It uses different candidate news vectors to adjust the user representations learned from the user's historical reading records. This allows the model to build candidate-guided user representations to accurately match candidate news to parts of user interests that are relevant to the candidate news. Finally, we effectively assign the weights of the two frame scores so that the models can fuse better. Extensive experiments on the MIND news recommendation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a vital role in affective cognition. However, there will be some limitations when facing the FER with single facial image data. Considering that extra data contains more information for molding, the facial action unit (AU) can be adopted as privileged information (PI) to assist the FER task. This article integrates AU information into an end-to-end deep network to support FER training. The proposed privileged action unit network (PAU-Net) gives ways of integrating AU information from the input aspect (type I) and output aspect (type II). Type I of PAU-Net takes AUs as input to guide the facial image network learning, which provides the AU-based emotion recognition result for the image-based FER model. While, type II of PAU-Net utilizes AUs as the output label for shallow layers of the network, which helps the model learn AU- related features and further assists advanced facial expression feature learning in subsequent layers. Note that PI enhances the network during the training and will not occur during the testing. Therefore, the network can still perform robustly with original input data in practice. Experiments are based on the CK+, MMI, and Oulu-CASIA data sets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PAU-Net in FER tasks.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition based on text-audio modalities is the core technology for transforming a graphical user interface into a voice user interface, and it plays a vital role in natural human-computer interaction systems. Currently, mainstream multimodal learning research has designed various fusion strategies to learn intermodality interactions but hardly considers that not all modalities play equal roles in emotion recognition. Therefore, the main challenge in multimodal emotion recognition is how to implement effective fusion algorithms based on the auxiliary structure. To address this problem, this article proposes an adaptive interactive attention network (AIA-Net). In AIA-Net, text is treated as a primary modality, and audio is an auxiliary modality. AIA-Net adapts to textual and acoustic features with different dimensions and learns their dynamic interactive relations in a more flexible way. The interactive relations are encoded as interactive attention weights to focus on the acoustic features that are effective for textual emotional representations. AIA-Net performs well in adaptively assisting the textual emotional representation with the acoustic emotional information. Moreover, multiple collaborative learning (co-learning) layers of AIA-Net achieve multiple multimodal interactions and the deep bottom-up evolution of emotional representations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative multiview clustering methods can efficiently realize the view fusion by exploring complementary and consistent information among multiple views. However, these studies ignore all the differences between multiple views in fusion. In fact, in the multiview clustering, the data are diverse from view to view. The larger the difference between any two views is, the more the fusion of these views is required. Moreover, a global tradeoff parameter is generally adopted to restrain the penalty related to the disagreement of all views, which is often defined empirically. Inspired by the idea of transfer learning, a series of novel collaborative multiview clustering algorithms are proposed to tackle these challenges. In the most basic one, each view performs clustering independently and learns from others to improve its own clustering performance, in which a global learning factor is defined to control the interaction between multiple views. The fuzzy memberships are regarded as the important knowledge to provide guidance between views, and the consensus constraint is defined to ensure the consistent partitions of all views. In addition, the local adaptive learning factors between any two views instead of a global fixed one are adopted in an improved version to emphasize the difference between views, and the adjustment strategy for the learning factor is further designed to guarantee the stability of multiview clustering without the influence of initial values. Finally, to identify the significance of different views to the clustering, the extended versions are excavated with the assignment of view weights and the maximum entropy regularization technique is employed to optimize the weights. Experiments on various real-world multiview datasets verify the superiority of the presented approaches.",

      "abstract": "Kernel clustering has the ability to get the inherent nonlinear structure of the data. But the high computational complexity and the unknown representation of the kernel space make it unavailable for the data clustering in distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. To solve this issue, we propose a new series of random feature-based collaborative kernel clustering algorithms in this article. In the most basic algorithm, each node in a distributed P2P network first maps its data into a low-dimensional random feature space with the approximation of the given kernel by using the random Fourier feature mapping method. Then, each node independently searches the clusters with its local data and the collaborative knowledge from its neighbor nodes, and the distributed clustering is performed among all network nodes until reaching the global consensus result, i.e., all nodes have the same cluster centers. In addition, an improved version is designed with assignment of feature weights, which is optimized by the maximum-entropy technique to extract important features for the cluster identification. What's more, to relief the impact of different kernel functions and related parameters on clustering results, the combination of multiple kernels rather than a single kernel is adopted for the low-dimensional approximation, and the optimized weights are assigned to provide the guidance on the choice of the kernels and their parameters and discover significant features at the same time. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods achieve similar and even better results than the traditional kernel clustering methods on various performance metrics, including the average classification rate, the average normalized mutual information, and the average adjusted rand index. More importantly, the low-dimensional random features approximated to kernels and the distributed clustering mechanism adopted in these methods bring the greatly lower temporal complexity.",

The accumulative errors result in a gradual decrease in the accuracy of trajectory prediction over time. Therefore, how to reduce the accumulative errors of the LSTM is a very critical issue. To solve this problem, we introduce a two-stage attention mechanism with the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, which uses the spatial attention mechanism and the output attention mechanism to weight the input hidden layer features and the output prediction of the decoder. In this way, the accuracy of trajectory prediction is improved. The cumulative error of the predicted trajectory is significantly reduced. The proposed method is validated on US-101 and I-80 datasets from NGSIM. The simulation results show that the test dataset's average error at one second and five seconds is reduced from 0.7676 meters and 7.7168 meters to 0.4601 meters and 4.2184 meters, respectively. The average prediction error is reduced by 45.33%.",

      "abstract": "In rating prediction research, how to capture user and item features from review text is a key to improving model prediction accuracy. The sparsity of review text and the accuracy of the description of items in the review text make it difficult to obtain accurate feature representations of users and items by modeling the text content alone. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the usefulness of the reviews at first because not all review texts are valuable. How to analyze the usefulness of a review is a key to modeling the review text. The way previous models use attention to inscribe semantic weights on the review text is not sufficient to indicate the degree of usefulness of a review, so we suggest adding property information to model reviews. Based on this, we propose an interaction recommendation model that is based on enhanced graph convolution and fuses review properties (PGIR), which incorporates property information into text modeling by different activations and matches useful property feature interaction pairs for review text in a self-supervised manner. This allows the model to obtain an accurate feature representation of the review text. In addition, we analyze the high-order connectivity among user–item pairs. Then, we design an enhanced graph convolution method to capture the collaborative signals between users and items and model the dynamic features of users and items on this basis. After extensive experiments conducted on five standard datasets based on Amazon, the results show that the PGIR model achieves a substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art models in terms of rating prediction. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate the superiority of our proposed property activation method, which further improves the rating prediction performance of the PGIR model.",

      "abstract": "Overparameterized neural networks enjoy great representation power on complex data, and more importantly yield sufficiently smooth output, which is crucial to their generalization and robustness. Most existing function approximation theories suggest that with sufficiently many parameters, neural networks can well approximate certain classes of functions in terms of the function value. The neural network themselves, however, can be highly nonsmooth. To bridge this gap, we take convolutional residual networks (ConvResNets) as an example, and prove that large ConvResNets can not only approximate a target function in terms of function value, but also exhibit sufficient first-order smoothness. Moreover, we extend our theory to approximating functions supported on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory partially justifies the benefits of using deep and wide networks in practice. Numerical experiments on adversarial robust image classification are provided to support our theory.",

Based on the Swin transformer model, our framework encodes the input image into a shared representation and makes predictions for each vision task using task-specific transformer-based decoder heads. At the heart of our approach is a shared attention mechanism modeling the dependencies across the tasks. We evaluate our model on several multitask benchmarks, showing that our MulT framework outperforms both the state-of-the art multitask convolutional neural network models and all the respective single task transformer models. Our experiments further highlight the benefits of sharing attention across all the tasks, and demonstrate that our MulT model is robust and generalizes well to new domains.

      "abstract": "This article proposes semantic embedding for image transformers (SEiTs) to explore semantic features of facial morphology in the action unit (AU) detection task. The conventional approaches typically rely on external information (e.g., facial landmarks) to obtain the location of facial components, whereas the SEiT can learn morphological features intrinsically from the face image. The pre-training task, namely semantic masked facial image modeling (SMFIM), aims to actively obtain facial morphological information. The pixels of the input facial image are randomly erased with semantic masks (e.g., nose, eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and lip). The embedding model tries to predict the presence of facial components for the input image that can learn semantic representations of the face simultaneously. The learned semantic embeddings are fed to transformer blocks, which enable global interaction between semantic elements. The SEiT integrates facial morphological information and global interaction characters, appropriate for AU detection. The experiments are conducted on the Binghamton-Pittsburgh 4D (BP4D) dataset and Denver intensity of spontaneous facial action (DISFA) dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SEiT.",

In this paper, Ansys workbench was used to establish the electric-thermal coupling model of finite element simulation for the connector assembly, and the temperature field simulation calculation and analysis were carried out for the connectors of different thickness under the condition of high current. The results show that the maximum temperature of the connector increases with the decrease of its cross-section thickness, and the higher the current is, the longer the power time will be, the higher the temperature will be. In addition, the connector with thickness of 0.8 mm has the risk of fusing under the action of 500 A current.",

On most online display platforms, porcelain is only displayed in two dimensions, and the sound display is relatively single. This paper studies and proposes a simulation method for visual and auditory multidimensional interaction in a distributed environment. Based on the porcelain photo acoustics of virtual simulation, in the 3D simulation porcelain model, by adjusting the intensity coefficient of the light source, the light propagation model on the surface and inside of the porcelain is established to realize the thinness and light transmittance of the porcelain. This research combines the fundamental frequency, harmonic frequency technology and volume with the 3D porcelain model, and use its structural characteristics and the principle of chime to synthesize the percussion sound of porcelain in a virtual simulation environment. The research conclusions can be applied to fields such as art online platform display.",

      "abstract": "Semantic segmentation plays a critical role in scene understanding for self-driving vehicles. A line of efforts has proven that global context matters in urban scene segmentation due to massive scale changes. However, we find that existing methods suffer from local ambiguities when dissipating continuous local context, i.e. scrambling to a huge receptive field of global cues by coarse pooling. To this end, this paper proposes a new Context Aggregation Module (CAM) that consists of two primary components: context encoding using no coarse pooling but encoder-decoders with appropriate sampling scales and gated fusion that extends gate attention mechanism to balance different-scale context during feature fusion. Weeding out coarse pooling and applying the encoder-decoder inherits the merits of exploring global context while avoiding the drawback of losing local contextual continuity. We then construct a Context Aggregation Network (CANet) and conduct extensive evaluations on challenging autonomous driving benchmarks of Cityscapes, CamVid and BDD100K. Consistently improved results evidence the effectiveness. Notably, we attain competitive mIoU 82.7% on Cityscapes and optimal mIoU 80.5% on CamVid.",

      "abstract": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are commonly applied in the emotion recognition research area. It can accurately reflect the emotional changes of the human body by applying graphical-based algorithms or models. EEG signals are nonlinear signals. Biological tissues’ adjustment and adaptive ability will inevitably affect electrophysiological signals, making EEG have the typical nonlinear characteristics. The graph convolutional broad network (GCB-net) extracted features from nonlinear signals and abstract features via a stacked convolutional neural network. It adopted the broad concept and enhanced the feature by the broad learning system (BLS), obtaining sound results. However, it performed poorly with the increasing network depth, and the accuracy of some features decreased with BLS. This article proposed a residual graph convolutional broad network (Residual GCB-net), which promotes the performance on a deeper layer network and extracts higher level information. It substitutes the original convolutional layer with residual learning blocks, which solves the deep learning network degradation and extracts more features in deeper networks. In the SJTU emotion EEG data set (SEED), GCB-Res net could obtain the best accuracy (94.56%) on the all-frequency band of differential entropy (DE) and promote much on another feature. In Dreamer, it obtained the best accuracy (91.55%) on the dimension of Arousal. The result demonstrated the excellent classification performance of Residual GCB-net in EEG emotion recognition. <p dir=\"ltr\">This is the coding for Residual GCB-Net: Residual Graph Convolutional Broad Network on Emotion Recognition, published on IEEE TCDS with <b>DOI:</b><b> </b><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2022.3147839\" target=\"_blank\">10.1109/TCDS.2022.3147839</a>.",

      "abstract": "The increasing scale of general-purpose Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) necessitates the study of more efficient adaptation across different downstream tasks. In this paper, we establish a Black-box Discrete Prompt Learning (BDPL) to resonate with pragmatic interactions between the cloud infrastructure and edge devices. Particularly, instead of fine-tuning the model in the cloud, we adapt PLMs by prompt learning, which efficiently optimizes only a few parameters of the discrete prompts. Moreover, we consider the scenario that we do not have access to the parameters and gradients of the pre-trained models, except for its outputs given inputs. This black-box setting secures the cloud infrastructure from potential attack and misuse to cause a single-point failure, which is preferable to the white-box counterpart by current infrastructures. Under this black-box constraint, we apply a variance-reduced policy gradient algorithm to estimate the gradients of parameters in the categorical distribution of each discrete prompt. In light of our method, the user devices can efficiently tune their tasks by querying the PLMs bounded by a range of API calls. Our experiments on RoBERTa and GPT-3 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement on eight benchmarks in a cloud-device collaboration manner. Finally, we conduct in-depth case studies to comprehensively analyze our method in terms of various data sizes, prompt lengths, training budgets, optimization objectives, prompt transferability, and explanations of the learned prompts. Our code will be available at https://github.com/shizhediao/Black-Box-Prompt-Learning.",

      "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce the modeling and implementation of a novel multimode amphibious robot, which is used for patrol and beach garbage cleaning in the land–water transition zone. Design/methodology/approach Starting from the design idea of multimode motion, the robot innovatively integrates the guiding fin and wheel together, is driven by the same motor and can achieve multimodal motion such as land, water surface and underwater with only six actuated degrees of freedom. The robot dispenses with the transmission mechanism by directly connecting the servo motor with a reducer to the actuator, so it has the characteristics of simplifying the structure and reducing the quality. And to the best of the authors' knowledge, the design of the robot can be considered the minimal configuration of amphibious robots with the same locomotion capabilities. Findings Based on the classical assumptions of underwater dynamics analysis, this paper uses basic airfoil theory to analyze the dynamics of the robot’s horizontal and vertical motions and establishes its simplified dynamics model. Also, the underwater motion of the robot is simulated, and the results are in good agreement with the existing research results. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the robot, a prototype is implemented and fully evaluated by experiments. Experimental results show that the robot can reach the maximum speed of 2.5 m/s and 0.3 m/s on land and underwater, respectively, proving the effectiveness of the robot. Originality/value The robot has higher work efficiency with the powerful multimode motion, and its simplified structure makes it more stable while costing less.",

      "abstract": "We enhance the accuracy and generalization of univariate time series point prediction by an explainable ensemble on the fly. We propose an Interpretable Dynamic Ensemble Architecture (IDEA), in which interpretable base learners give predictions independently with sparse communication as a group. The model is composed of several sequentially stacked groups connected by group backcast residuals and recurrent input competition. Ensemble driven by end-to-end training both horizontally and vertically brings state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances. Forecast accuracy improves by 2.6% over the best statistical benchmark on the TOURISM dataset and 2% over the best deep learning benchmark on the M4 dataset. The architecture enjoys several advantages, being applicable to time series from various domains, explainable to users with specialized modular structure and robust to changes in task distribution.",

      "abstract": "With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant, and history-relevant responses than baseline models.",

      "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning tasks such as commonsense knowledge graph completion and commonsense question answering require powerful representation learning. In this paper, we propose to learn commonsense knowledge representation by MICO, a Multi-alternative contrastIve learning framework on COmmonsense knowledge graphs (MICO). MICO generates the commonsense knowledge representation by contextual interaction between entity nodes and relations with multi-alternative contrastive learning. In MICO, the head and tail entities in an (h,r,t) knowledge triple are converted to two relation-aware sequence pairs (a premise and an alternative) in the form of natural language. Semantic representations generated by MICO can benefit the following two tasks by simply comparing the similarity score between the representations: 1) zero-shot commonsense question answering tasks; 2) inductive commonsense knowledge graph completion tasks. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a crucial problem in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Current methods achieve decent performance by utilizing supervised learning and large pre-trained language models. However, the imbalanced training dataset leads to poor performance on rare senses and zero-shot senses. There are more training instances and senses for words with top frequency ranks than those with low frequency ranks in the training dataset. We investigate the statistical relation between word frequency rank and word sense number distribution. Based on the relation, we propose a Z-reweighting method on the word level to adjust the training on the imbalanced dataset. The experiments show that the Z-reweighting strategy achieves performance gain on the standard English all words WSD benchmark. Moreover, the strategy can help models generalize better on rare and zero-shot senses.",

      "abstract": "A challenge for education and teaching in universities is posed by “Internet plus,” which has made numerous educational resources at universities richer and more accessible. The development of a professional Japanese teaching resource base should be centered on the needs and characteristics of Japanese teaching in universities, as well as establish and enhance the mechanism for resource base construction. All forms of instructional resources should also continuously be updated and improved in order to realize the diversified, systematic, open, and long‐term development of Japanese instructional resources. In light of the current state of the information technology industry’s rapid expansion, this essay examines a few issues with the building of a Japanese teaching resource database. A fundamental Japanese teaching resource database built on DNN was created as a result. The CNN technology is used in this study to create the Arduino device identification application. Utilizing gadgets in the learning process, learners can obtain learning resources using the Arduino device identification program before engaging in learning activities. The experimental findings also demonstrate that the precision rate and recall rate of the Japanese teaching resource database system developed in this study may achieve about 93 and 94 percent, respectively. Its performance is better than the conventional teaching resource system, and it can offer top‐notch teaching resources for teaching fundamental Japanese.",

      "abstract": "Low-frequency word prediction remains a challenge in modern neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Recent adaptive training methods promote the output of infrequent words by emphasizing their weights in the overall training objectives. Despite the improved recall of low-frequency words, their prediction precision is unexpectedly hindered by the adaptive objectives. Inspired by the observation that low-frequency words form a more compact embedding space, we tackle this challenge from a representation learning perspective. Specifically, we propose a frequency-aware token-level contrastive learning method, in which the hidden state of each decoding step is pushed away from the counterparts of other target words, in a soft contrastive way based on the corresponding word frequencies. We conduct experiments on widely used NIST Chinese-English and WMT14 English-German translation tasks. Empirical results show that our proposed methods can not only significantly improve the translation quality but also enhance lexical diversity and optimize word representation space. Further investigation reveals that, comparing with related adaptive training strategies, the superiority of our method on low-frequency word prediction lies in the robustness of token-level recall across different frequencies without sacrificing precision.",

However, continuous and reliable mobile acoustic communication is the bottleneck that limits the development of AUV-aided UWSNs. This paper analyzes three typical factors that impact the AUV communications based on the lake and sea test data, i.e., the doppler effect, signal strength weakening, and multipath interference. Meanwhile, we propose improvements for AUV and acoustic modem, respectively, in terms of AUV autonomous control and intelligent technology and underwater acoustic communication technology to improve mobile acoustic communication reliability.",

      "abstract": "Providing qualified communications and optimizing network performance for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) is difficult due to limited battery power and storage, unpredictable channel conditions, and significant communication interference (including ambient noise and inter-nodes interferences). Power allocation is an important technology for UWSNs. In this paper, we analyzed the constraints of UWSNs and proposed a distributed power allocation scheme based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, which dynamically tunes the independent transmit power according to changing environments. We improve the number of concurrent communications and optimizes network capacity by fully leveraging the spatial separation of wireless networks. We compared the proposed approach with baseline methods in network capacity and communication fairness in different communication scenarios when the number of underwater nodes increases. Experiments confirmed that our solution achieves a significantly better trade-off between network capacity and fairness, while still satisfying the lifetime criteria.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to provide qualified and fair communications for time-sharing and spatial reuse underwater wireless sensor networks when energy supplements are limited, the environment is non-stationary, and communication interference is strong. Due to the physical separation of underwater nodes, transmissions are intended to occur concurrently to maximize network capacity. Currently available approaches for improving fairness are frequently at the expense of network capacity. Methods that seek a better trade-off between fairness and network capacity are required. This paper proposes a novel approach to maximize network capacity and improve communication fairness by increasing simultaneous communications, achieving time-sharing, and spatial-reuse UWSNs. It is a distributed, multi-agent reinforcement learning approach that utilizes an observation encoder and a local utility network to coordinate collaboration across underwater nodes by adaptively tuning transmit parameters in response to local observations. In terms of network capacity, fairness, and reuse, we compared the suggested methodology to standard methods. Experiments reveal that, when compared to other ways, ours maximizes reuse and produces a significantly superior trade-off between network capacity and fairness, while still meeting lifetime and energy restrictions. The work presented in this article is anticipated to develop into valuable tools for designing and optimizing UWSNs.",

For PUF-based mutual authentication protocols, a method to abstract the security properties of hardware by using logic of events is proposed, and the application aspects of logic of events are extended to protocols based on hardware security. With the interaction of PUF-based mutual authentication protocol formally described by logic of events, the basic sequences are constructed and the strong authentication property in protocol interaction process is verified. Based on the logic of events, the freshness of nonces is defined, and the persist rule is proposed according to the concept of freshness, which ensures the consistency of the protocol state and behavior predicate in the proof process, and reduces the complexity and redundancy in the protocol analysis process. Under reasonable assumptions, the security of the protocol is proven, and the fact that logic of events applies to PUF-based mutual authentication protocols is shown.",

      "abstract": "Sparse training is a natural idea to accelerate the training speed of deep\\nneural networks and save the memory usage, especially since large modern neural\\nnetworks are significantly over-parameterized. However, most of the existing\\nmethods cannot achieve this goal in practice because the chain rule based\\ngradient (w.r.t. structure parameters) estimators adopted by previous methods\\nrequire dense computation at least in the backward propagation step. This paper\\nsolves this problem by proposing an efficient sparse training method with\\ncompletely sparse forward and backward passes. We first formulate the training\\nprocess as a continuous minimization problem under global sparsity constraint.\\nWe then separate the optimization process into two steps, corresponding to\\nweight update and structure parameter update. For the former step, we use the\\nconventional chain rule, which can be sparse via exploiting the sparse\\nstructure. For the latter step, instead of using the chain rule based gradient\\nestimators as in existing methods, we propose a variance reduced policy\\ngradient estimator, which only requires two forward passes without backward\\npropagation, thus achieving completely sparse training. We prove that the\\nvariance of our gradient estimator is bounded. Extensive experimental results\\non real-world datasets demonstrate that compared to previous methods, our\\nalgorithm is much more effective in accelerating the training process, up to an\\norder of magnitude faster.\\n",

      "abstract": "Cement has been widely used in civil engineering, whose quality directly affects the safety of buildings. Cement compressive strength, as an important quality indicator, its accurate estimation is of great significance in quality inspections and the design of high-performance products. However, existing measurement technology remains traditional and destructive. Except for high time-consuming and the waste of various resources, it requires significant improvement since the unprofessional operations will give rise to large errors. In this article, an efficient system is proposed to estimate the cement compressive strength based on the broad learning and internal factors, in which the index system describes the internal factors affecting the compressive strength, and the broad learning system distills the potential correlation between the compressive strength and those factors. It can nondestructively estimate the strength directly with the internal factors, e.g., clinker composition and physical properties. In addition, to verify its practicability and to assist the formula optimization in the application, the robustness test and factorial analysis are designed. The experimental results prove that this model can accurately estimate the strength with excellent generalization ability, which saves labor power and material, avoids large errors caused by unprofessional operations, and aids high-performance cement production. Especially, its ability to rapidly build an accurate estimation model is beneficial for the production of various cement in industry.",

Emotion recognition is one important task for a robot to communicate with human beings. Although different works have been proposed to complete the task of emotion recognition, conventional methods often require a lot of time and memory resources. Since a robot is often required to react timely and equipped with limited resources, we propose an enhanced Siamese network algorithm to resolve such a problem. We combine Siamese network with broad learning system while further improving mechanism of similarity metric. Experiment results show that our method can achieve a comparable performance to conventional deep learning method while reducing consumption of computing time and memory resources.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a structure constraint matrix factorization framework for different behavior segmentation of the human behavior sequential data. This framework is based on the structural information of the behavior continuity and the high similarity between neighboring frames. Due to the high similarity and high dimensionality of human behavior data, the high-precision segmentation of human behavior is hard to achieve from the perspective of application and academia. By making the behavior continuity hypothesis, first, the effective constraint regular terms are constructed. Subsequently, the clustering framework based on constrained non-negative matrix factorization is established. Finally, the segmentation result can be obtained by using the spectral clustering and graph segmentation algorithm. For illustration, the proposed framework is applied to the Weiz dataset, Keck dataset, mo_86 dataset, and mo_86_9 dataset. Empirical experiments on several public human behavior datasets demonstrate that the structure constraint matrix factorization framework can automatically segment human behavior sequences. Compared to the classical algorithm, the proposed framework can ensure consistent segmentation of sequential points within behavior actions and provide better performance in accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs. In AdderNets, we take the $\\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input feature as the output response. We first develop a theoretical foundation for AdderNets, by showing that both the single hidden layer AdderNet and the width-bounded deep AdderNet with ReLU activation functions are universal function approximators. An approximation bound for AdderNets with a single hidden layer is also presented. We further analyze the influence of this new similarity measure on the optimization of neural network and develop a special training scheme for AdderNets. Based on the gradient magnitude, an adaptive learning rate strategy is proposed to enhance the training procedure of AdderNets. AdderNets can achieve a 75.7% Top-1 accuracy and a 92.3% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in the convolutional layer.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Study Objectives The relationship of iron with cognitive and motor impairment in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) remains unknown. Methods Twenty-nine (29) patients and 28 healthy controls (HCs) underwent susceptibility weighted imaging and susceptibility mapping. These images were used to evaluate the nigrosome-1 (N1) sign in the substantia nigra (SN), global and regional high-iron (RII) content, and volume of subcortical nuclei. Results The number of iRBD patients with N1 loss (12) was significantly higher than HCs (2) (p = 0.005). Compared with HCs, the iRBD patients had reduced volume of the right caudate nucleus (RCN) (p &amp;lt; 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] correction) but no significant changes in global and RII iron of the subcortical nuclei (all p &amp;gt; 0.05, FDR correction). Multiple regression analysis revealed that: for cognitive function, the RII iron of the RCN was significantly correlated with visuospatial function and the global iron of the right dentate nucleus (RDN) was correlated with memory function; for motor function, the RII iron of the left DN (LDN) and global iron of the left CN correlated with the Alternate-Tap test (left, average), the global iron of the LDN correlated with the Alternate-Tap test (right), and the global iron of the left GP correlated with the 3-m Timed Up and Go test (all p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR correction). Conclusions Our exploratory analysis found that iRBD patients had a higher incidence of N1 loss and reduced RCN volume after FDR correction. Cognitive and motor impairment were associated with iron deposition in several cerebral nuclei after FDR correction.",

      "abstract": "The chit-chat-based conversational recommendation systems (CRS) provide item recommendations to users through natural language interactions. To better understand user's intentions, external knowledge graphs (KG) have been introduced into chit-chat-based CRS. However, existing chit-chat-based CRS usually generate repetitive item recommendations, and they cannot properly infuse knowledge from KG into CRS to generate informative responses. To remedy these issues, we first reformulate the conversational recommendation task to highlight that the recommended items should be new and possibly interested by users. Then, we propose the Knowledge-Enriched Conversational Recommendation System (KECRS). Specifically, we develop the Bag-of-Entity (BOE) loss and the infusion loss to better integrate KG with CRS for generating more diverse and informative responses. BOE loss provides an additional supervision signal to guide CRS to learn from both human-written utterances and KG. Infusion loss bridges the gap between the word embeddings and entity embeddings by minimizing distances of the same words in these two embeddings. Moreover, we facilitate our study by constructing a high-quality KG, \\ie The Movie Domain Knowledge Graph (TMDKG). Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that KECRS outperforms state-of-the-art chit-chat-based CRS, in terms of both recommendation accuracy and response generation quality.",

Recent machine learning and deep learning based approaches have been proposed yet many of them are severely limited by their feature selection and inherent neural network architecture. As network data by nature are of non-Euclidean distance space and carry abundant chronological relationship, we are inspired to utilize geometric deep learning that simultaneously takes into account packet raw bytes, metadata and packet relations for classifying encrypted network traffic. We validate our proposed graph neural network (GNN) models against the reference methods including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) quantitatively and demonstrate that the proposed graph neural networks outperform the state of art.",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained text encoders have drawn sustaining attention in natural language processing (NLP) and shown their capability in obtaining promising results in different tasks. Recent studies illustrated that external self-supervised signals (or knowledge extracted by unsupervised learning, such as n-grams) are beneficial to provide useful semantic evidence for understanding languages such as Chinese, so as to improve the performance on various downstream tasks accordingly. To further enhance the encoders, in this paper, we propose to pre-train n-gram-enhanced encoders with a large volume of data and advanced techniques for training. Moreover, we try to extend the encoder to different languages as well as different domains, where it is confirmed that the same architecture is applicable to these varying circumstances and new state-of-the-art performance is observed from a long list of NLP tasks across languages and domains.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the appearance of the broad learning system (BLS) is poised to revolutionize conventional artificial intelligence methods. It represents a step toward building more efficient and effective machine-learning methods that can be extended to a broader range of necessary research fields. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the BLS in data mining and neural networks for the first time, focusing on summarizing various BLS methods from the aspects of its algorithms, theories, applications, and future open research questions. First, we introduce the basic pattern of BLS manifestation, the universal approximation capability, and essence from the theoretical perspective. Furthermore, we focus on BLS's various improvements based on the current state of the theoretical research, which further improves its flexibility, stability, and accuracy under general or specific conditions, including classification, regression, semisupervised, and unsupervised tasks. Due to its remarkable efficiency, impressive generalization performance, and easy extendibility, BLS has been applied in different domains. Next, we illustrate BLS's practical advances, such as computer vision, biomedical engineering, control, and natural language processing. Finally, the future open research problems and promising directions for BLSs are pointed out.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis uses a series of automated cognitive methods to determine the author's or speaker's attitudes toward an expressed object or text's overall emotional tendencies. In recent years, the growing scale of opinionated text from social networks has brought significant challenges to humans' sentimental tendency mining. The pretrained language model designed to learn contextual representation achieves better performance than traditional learning word vectors. However, the existing two basic approaches for applying pretrained language models to downstream tasks, feature-based and fine-tuning methods, are usually considered separately. What is more, different sentiment analysis tasks cannot be handled by the single task-specific contextual representation. In light of these pros and cons, we strive to propose a broad multitask transformer network (BMT-Net) to address these problems. BMT-Net takes advantage of both feature-based and fine-tuning methods. It was designed to explore the high-level information of robust and contextual representation. Primarily, our proposed structure can make the learned representations universal across tasks via multitask transformers. In addition, BMT-Net can roundly learn the robust contextual representation utilized by the broad learning system due to its powerful capacity to search for suitable features in deep and broad ways. The experiments were conducted on two popular datasets of binary Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) and SemEval Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Twitter). Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the improved representation with both deep and broad ways is shown to achieve a better F1 -score of 0.778 in Twitter and accuracy of 94.0% in the SST-2 dataset, respectively. These experimental results demonstrate the abilities of recognition in sentiment analysis and highlight the significance of previously overlooked design decisions about searching contextual features in deep and broad spaces.",

      "abstract": "Auxiliary information attracts more and more attention in the area of machine learning. Attempts so far to include such auxiliary information in state-of-the-art learning process have often been based on simply appending these auxiliary features to the data level or feature level. In this paper, we intend to propose a novel training method with new options and architectures. Siamese labels, which were used in the training phase as auxiliary modules. While in the testing phase, the auxiliary module should be removed. Siamese label module makes it easier to train and improves the performance in testing process. In general, the main contributions can be summarized as, 1) Siamese Labels are firstly proposed as auxiliary information to improve the learning efficiency; 2) We establish a new architecture, Siamese Labels Auxiliary Network (SilaNet), which is to assist the training of the model; 3) Siamese Labels Auxiliary Network is applied to compress the model parameters by 50% and ensure the high accuracy at the same time. For the purpose of comparison, we tested the network on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR100 using some common models. The proposed SilaNet performs excellent efficiency both on the accuracy and robustness.",

      "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) is a challenging problem in the design of deep learning due to its nonconvexity. To address this problem, an adaptive scalable NAS method (AS-NAS) is proposed based on the reinforced I-Ching divination evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) and variable-architecture encoding strategy. First, unlike the typical reinforcement learning (RL)-based and evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based NAS methods, a simplified RL algorithm is developed and used as the reinforced operator controller to adaptively select the efficient operators of IDEA. Without the complex actor–critic parts, the reinforced IDEA based on simplified RL can enhance the search efficiency of the original EA with lower computational cost. Second, a variable-architecture encoding strategy is proposed to encode neural architecture as a fixed-length binary string. By simultaneously considering variable layers, channels, and connections between different convolution layers, the deep neural architecture can be scalable. Through the integration with the reinforced IDEA and variable-architecture encoding strategy, the design of the deep neural architecture can be adaptively scalable. Finally, the proposed AS-NAS are integrated with the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${L}_{1/2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> regularization to increase the sparsity of the optimized neural architecture. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we aim to adapt a generic pretrained model with a relatively small amount of domain-specific data. We demonstrate that by explicitly incorporating the multi-granularity information of unseen and domain-specific words via the adaptation of (word based) n-grams, the performance of a generic pretrained model can be greatly improved. Specifically, we introduce a Transformer-based Domain-aware N-gram Adaptor, T-DNA, to effectively learn and incorporate the semantic representation of different combinations of words in the new domain. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of T-DNA on eight low-resource downstream tasks from four domains. We show that T-DNA is able to achieve significant improvements compared to existing methods on most tasks using limited data with lower computational costs. Moreover, further analyses demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of both unseen words and the information of different granularities.(1)",

      "abstract": "The broad learning system (BLS) has been proved to be effective and efficient lately. In this article, several deep variants of BLS are reviewed, and a new adaptive incremental structure, Stacked BLS, is proposed. The proposed model is a novel incremental stacking of BLS. This invariant inherits the efficiency and effectiveness of BLS that the structure and weights of lower layers of BLS are fixed when the new blocks are added. The incremental stacking algorithm computes not only the connection weights between the newly stacking blocks but also the connection weights of the enhancement nodes within the BLS block. The Stacked BLS is considered as the increment of \"layers\" and \"neurons\" dynamically during the training for multilayer neural networks. The proposed architecture along with the training algorithms that utilizes the residual characteristic is very versatile in comparison with traditional fixed architecture. Finally, experimental results on UCI datasets, MNIST dataset, NORB dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, SVHN dataset, and CIFAR-100 dataset indicate that the proposed method outperforms the selected state-of-the-art methods on both accuracy and training speed, such as deep residual networks. The results also imply that the proposed structure could highly reduce the number of nodes and the training time of the original BLS in the classification task of some datasets.",

      "abstract": "The traditional collaborative fuzzy clustering can effectively perform data clustering in distributed peer-to-peer networks, which is an impossible task to complete for the centralized clustering methods due to privacy and security requirements or network transmission technology constraints. But it will increase the number of clustering iterations and lead to lower efficiency of the clustering. Moreover, the collaborative mechanism hidden in the iterative process of clustering cannot be well revealed and explained. In this article, a novel series of transfer collaborative fuzzy clustering algorithms are proposed to solve these issues. In the first basic algorithm, the transfer learning among neighbor nodes vividly expresses the collaborative mechanism and enhances the information collaboration to accelerate the convergence of fuzzy clustering. Meanwhile, neighbor nodes can learn the knowledge from each other to further promote their respective clustering performance. Then, an improved version, with the learning-rate-adjustable strategy instead of fixed values, is designed to highlight the different influence between neighbor nodes, and the appropriate learning rates between neighbor nodes are achieved to ensure the stable clustering accuracy. Finally, two extended versions with the attribute-weight-entropy regularization technique are presented for the clustering of high dimensional sparse data and the extraction of important subspace features. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared with the related prototype-based clustering methods.",

      "abstract": "Incremental capacity (IC) analysis is an effective and widely used approach to evaluate the lithium-ion battery remaining capacity. A limitation for IC based capacity estimation is that it requires a consistent constant charging current for each test and demands a large amount of data to be stored, which hinder its use in practical conditions. To address the issues, this paper proposes an online capacity estimation method for battery module with incremental capacity curves processed by tracking differentiator. Specifically, the IC features, such as peak voltage, peak amplitude, are analyzed for the battery module empirically and theoretically. The analytic linear relationship between the IC features and capacity are formulated. As a basis, the calculation of dQ/dV is converted to the derivative of terminal voltage, which is obtained by a designed tracking differentiator. For the iteratively derived IC curve, a realtime peak detection algorithm is proposed to detect the second peak voltage without the requirement to store any historical data. The proposed method is not sensitive to noise and applicable to common charging conditions. Experimental results with cycle data for a commercial 206Ah battery module reveals the superiority of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is an important industrial solution for automatic discovery and deployment of the machine learning models. However, designing an integrated AutoML system faces four great challenges of configurability, scalability, integrability, and platform diversity. In this work, we present VEGA, an efficient and comprehensive AutoML framework that is compatible and optimized for multiple hardware platforms. a) The VEGA pipeline integrates various modules of AutoML, including Neural Architecture Search (NAS), Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO), Auto Data Augmentation, Model Compression, and Fully Train. b) To support a variety of search algorithms and tasks, we design a novel fine-grained search space and its description language to enable easy adaptation to different search algorithms and tasks. c) We abstract the common components of deep learning frameworks into a unified interface. VEGA can be executed with multiple back-ends and hardwares. Extensive benchmark experiments on multiple tasks demonstrate that VEGA can improve the existing AutoML algorithms and discover new high-performance models against SOTA methods, e.g. the searched DNet model zoo for Ascend 10x faster than EfficientNet-B5 and 9.2x faster than RegNetX-32GF on ImageNet. VEGA is open-sourced at https://github.com/huawei-noah/vega.",

AEBS is an important part of vehicle active safety, so it is very meaningful to study the fault injection test of AEBS. In this paper, a method of functional safety validation test of AEBS based on fault injection is studied, including the preparation, execution and passing standards of the test. This test method can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the security mechanism and is suitable for functional security validation test.",

      "abstract": "Resource constraints, e.g. limited product inventory or financial strength, may affect consumers' choices or preferences in some recommendation tasks but are usually ignored in previous recommendation methods. In this paper, we aim to mine the cue of user preferences in resource-limited recommendation tasks, for which purpose we specifically build a large used car transaction dataset possessing resource-limitation characteristics. Accordingly, we propose an interest-behavior multiplicative network to predict the user's future interaction based on dynamic connections between users and items. To describe the user-item connection dynamically, mutually-recursive recurrent neural networks (MRRNNs) are introduced to capture interactive long-term dependencies, and meantime effective representations of users and items are obtained. To further take the resource limitation into consideration, a resource-limited branch is built to specifically explore the influence of resource variation on user preferences. Finally, mutual information is introduced to measure the similarity between the user action and fused features to predict future interaction, where the fused features come from both MRRNNs and resource-limited branches. We test the performance on the built used car transaction dataset as well as the Tmall dataset, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of our framework.",

Uncertainty analysis is very significant in situation assessment. This article proposes an SA method based on uncertainty risk analysis. Under uncertain conditions, according to the random environment model and Gaussian distribution model, the collision probability between multiple vehicles is estimated by comprehensive trajectory prediction. The proposed method considers collision probabilities of different prediction points within and outside the prediction range and obtains long-term accurate prediction results. The method is suitable for the situation risk assessment of sensor systems in the presence of unexpected dynamic obstacles, sensor failures or communication losses in traffic, and different environmental sensing accuracy. The experimental results show that in the dynamic traffic environment, the proposed scenario assessment method can not only accurately predict and assess the situation risks within the prediction range, but also provide accurate scenario risk assessment outside the prediction range.",

      "abstract": "Due to the narrow thermal window of infrared (IR) image sensor array, the represented image becomes dim and its details become blurred. Different contrast and detail enhancement technologies were deployed to improve image quality. An enhancement algorithm with bilateral filter is a state of art method, which first transforms an infrared image into a base part and a detail part, and then expands the detail part and suppresses the base part to enhancement the contrast of the IR image. However, this method cannot efficiently distinguish the background and objectives of the detail part. As a result, the noise information gets amplified when the detail part is expanded, leading to increase noise and to obstruct the sharpening of the detail part. To solve these problems, a novel enhancement algorithm based on the neutrosophic sets is proposed, which transforms the detail part into the neutrosophic domain. Our method utilises three membership functions of pixels in the neutrosophic domain: T (True), F (False) and I (Indeterminacy), which correspond to objective, background and transitional regions of image, respectively. The proposed algorithm is verified and compared with other existing algorithms. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the contrast and preserve the details of an infrared image.",

      "abstract": "These days, physiological signals have been studied more broadly for emotion recognition to realize emotional intelligence in human-computer interaction. However, due to the complexity of emotions and individual differences in physiological responses, how to design reliable and effective models has become an important issue. In this article, we propose a regularized deep fusion framework for emotion recognition based on multimodal physiological signals. After extracting the effective features from different types of physiological signals, we construct ensemble dense embeddings of multimodal features using kernel matrices, and then utilize a deep network architecture to learn task-specific representations for each kind of physiological signal from these ensemble dense embeddings. Finally, a global fusion layer with a regularization term, which can efficiently explore the correlation and diversity among all of the representations in a synchronous optimization process, is designed to fuse generated representations. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that this framework can improve the performance of subject-independent emotion recognition compared to single-modal classifiers or other fusion methods. Data visualization also demonstrates that the final fusion representation exhibits higher class-separability power for emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Keyphrase generation aims to produce a set of phrases summarizing the essentials of a given document. Conventional methods normally apply an encoder-decoder architecture to generate the output keyphrases for an input document, where they are designed to focus on each current document so they inevitably omit crucial corpus-level information carried by other similar documents, i.e., the cross-document dependency and latent topics. In this paper, we propose CDKGen, a Transformer-based keyphrase generator, which expands the Transformer to global attention with cross-document attention networks to incorporate available documents as references so as to generate better keyphrases with the guidance of topic information. On top of the proposed Transformer + cross-document attention architecture, we also adopt a copy mechanism to enhance our model via selecting appropriate words from documents to deal with out-of-vocabulary words in keyphrases. Experiment results on five benchmark datasets illustrate the validity and effectiveness of our model, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. Further analyses confirm that the proposed model is able to generate keyphrases consistent with references while keeping sufficient diversity. The code of CDKGen is available at https://github.com/SVAIGBA/CDKGen.",

CDMER is more challenging than the conventional micro-expression recognition (MER), because the training and testing samples in CDMER come from different micro-expression databases, resulting in inconsistency of the feature distributions between the training and testing sets. In this paper, we contribute to this topic from three aspects. First, we establish a CDMER experimental evaluation protocol aiming to allow the researchers to conveniently work on this topic and evaluate their proposed methods under the same standard. Second, we conduct benchmark experiments by using NINE state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) methods and SIX popular spatiotemporal descriptors for investigating CDMER problem from two different perspectives. Third, we propose a novel DA method called region selective transfer regression (RSTR) to deal with the CDMER task. The overall superior performance of RSTR over the state-of-the-art DA methods demonstrates that taking into consideration the facial local region information used in RSTR contributes to developing effective DA methods for dealing with CDMER problem.",

In such case, the collinearity among input variables may inflate the error of parameter estimation, resulting in instability of prediction results when training and test distributions do not match. In this paper we theoretically analyze this fundamental problem and propose a sample reweighting method that reduces collinearity among input variables. Our method can be seen as a pretreatment of data to improve the condition of design matrix, and it can then be combined with any standard learning method for parameter estimation and variable selection. Empirical studies on both simulation and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of more stable performance across different distributed data.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hand gesture is one of the most intuitive and natural ways for human to communicate with computers, and it has been widely adopted in many human–computer interaction applications. However, it is still a challenging problem when confronted with complex background, illumination variation and occlusion in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a two-stage hand gesture recognition method is proposed to tackle these problems. At the first stage, hand pose estimation is developed to locate the hand keypoints using the convolutional pose machine, which can effectively localize hand keypoints even in a complex background. At the second stage, the Fuzzy Gaussian mixture models (FGMMs) are tailored to reject the nongesture patterns and classify the gestures based on the estimated hand keypoints. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is effective, robust, and satisfactory in real-time scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the intervention effect of Naikan cognitive therapy (NCT)on psychosomatic symptoms of female compulsory drug addicts. Methods Seventy drug addicts who met the inclusion criteria and volunteered to participate in the study were selected and randomly divided into intervention group(n=35) and control group(n=35) with random number table method.The intervention group received 10 consecutive days of NCT, while the control group received the same period of mental health education.Before and after treatment, the two groups were assessed with symptoms check list-90(SCL-90), preceived social support scale(PSSS), simple coping style scale(SCSQ) and inclination of relapse questionnaire of drug rehabilitated addicts. Results There was no significant difference between the two groups before the intervention (all P>0.05). Compared with pre-intervention, the total score of SCL-90((176.49±40.85) vs (152.60±31.17)), somatization, compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, terror, paranoid and psychiatric factors were significantly decreased and the total scores of PSSS((59.09±14.60) vs (64.43±10.42)) family support, friend support and other support subscales increased significantly post-NCT intervention in the intervention group (all P 0.05). Conclusion Naikan cognitive therapy can significantly improve the psychosomatic symptoms perceive social support and positive coping styles, and reduce the tendency of negative coping and relapse of female compulsory drug addicts. Key words: Naikan cognitive therapy; Compulsory drug addicts; Physical and psychological symptoms; Relapse tendency",

      "abstract": "Maintenance work order records provide valuable insights into chemical plants and production efficiency. These records are manually created in computerized management systems for routine and emergency maintenance. However, since the records are manually created, recording errors are not uncommon. The resulting datasets are additionally imbalanced, i.e., they have significantly more instances of certain classes than other minority classes. It is very challenging to use such datasets for classification and prediction of future events. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework that uses derivative-free optimization (DFO) to optimize the performance of classification models based on datasets that may be imbalanced. We apply our modeling framework to 15 real-world work order datasets. We also evaluate ten mixed-integer box-bounded DFO solvers for their ability to optimize machine learning models from industrial datasets. Compared to standard solutions, our results show dramatic improvements in the prediction accuracies of the models.",

However, it is known that this type of results does not perfectly match the practice, as NTK-based analysis requires the network weights to stay very close to their initialization throughout training, and cannot handle regularizers or gradient noises. In this paper, we provide a generalized neural tangent kernel analysis and show that noisy gradient descent with weight decay can still exhibit a “kernel-like” behavior. This implies that the training loss converges linearly up to a certain accuracy. We also establish a novel generalization error bound for two-layer neural networks trained by noisy gradient descent with weight decay. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

      "abstract": "Contextual features always play an important role in Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Wordhood information, being one of the contextual features, is proved to be useful in many conventional character-based segmenters. However, this feature receives less attention in recent neural models and it is also challenging to design a framework that can properly integrate wordhood information from different wordhood measures to existing neural frameworks. In this paper, we therefore propose a neural framework, WMSEG, which uses memory networks to incorporate wordhood information with several popular encoder-decoder combinations for CWS. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate the memory mechanism successfully models wordhood information for neural segmenters and helps WMSEG achieve state-ofthe-art performance on all those datasets. Further experiments and analyses also demonstrate the robustness of our proposed framework with respect to different wordhood measures and the efficiency of wordhood information in cross-domain experiments.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we will investigate skeleton-based action recognition by employing high-order statistics feature and first-order statistics feature, where the high-order statistics feature is characterized by symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Noting that SPD matrices are theoretically embedded on Riemannian manifolds, we propose an end-to-end deep manifold-to-manifold transforming network (DMT-Net), which can make SPD matrices flow from one Riemannian manifold to another one for facilitating the action recognition task. To learn discriminative SPD features from both spatial and temporal dependencies, we propose a neural network model with three novel layers on manifolds: i.e., (1) the local SPD convolutional layer, (2) the non-linear SPD activation layer, and (3) the Riemannian-preserved recursive layer. The SPD property is preserved through all layers without the singular value decomposition (SVD) operation, which has to be conducted in the existing methods with expensive computation cost. Furthermore, a diagonalizing SPD layer is designed to efficiently calculate the final metric for the classification task. Finally, DMT-Net is further fused with a first order layer to capture temporal evolution information. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the task of action recognition, where the input signals are represented as SPD matrices. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive over state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are important fundamental tasks for Chinese language processing, where joint learning of them is an effective one-step solution for both tasks. Previous studies for joint CWS and POS tagging mainly follow the character-based tagging paradigm with introducing contextual information such as n-gram features or sentential representations from recurrent neural models. However, for many cases, the joint tagging needs not only modeling from context features but also knowledge attached to them (e.g., syntactic relations among words); limited efforts have been made by existing research to meet such needs. In this paper, we propose a neural model named TWASP for joint CWS and POS tagging following the character-based sequence labeling paradigm, where a two-way attention mechanism is used to incorporate both context feature and their corresponding syntactic knowledge for each input character. Particularly, we use existing language processing toolkits to obtain the auto-analyzed syntactic knowledge for the context, and the proposed attention module can learn and benefit from them although their quality may not be perfect. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the two-way attentions for joint CWS and POS tagging, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved on five benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Constituency parsing is a fundamental and important task for natural language understanding, where a good representation of contextual information can help this task. N-grams, which is a conventional type of feature for contextual information, have been demonstrated to be useful in many tasks, and thus could also be beneficial for constituency parsing if they are appropriately modeled. In this paper, we propose span attention for neural chart-based constituency parsing to leverage n-gram information. Considering that current chart-based parsers with Transformer-based encoder represent spans by subtraction of the hidden states at the span boundaries, which may cause information loss especially for long spans, we incorporate n-grams into span representations by weighting them according to their contributions to the parsing process. Moreover, we propose categorical span attention to further enhance the model by weighting n-grams within different length categories, and thus benefit long-sentence parsing. Experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in parsing Arabic, Chinese, and English, where state-of-the-art performance is obtained by our approach on all of them.",

      "abstract": "Feature selection is used to extract the most essential features from the data without degrading the performance of an algorithm, especially a classification algorithm. Various evolutionary algorithms (EAs) combined with classification algorithms are commonly used for feature selection. This paper suggests an innovative feature selection algorithm based on I-Ching Divination Evolutionary Algorithm, called binary IDEA (BIDEA). The main idea is to use a series of hexagrams encoded as binary vectors, which is called the hexagram state to represent the solutions of selected features. After three flexible operations, intrication, turnover and mutual, the transformed hexagram state can be obtained as candidate solutions. Then the optimized hexagram state can be searched to form the new state in the next iteration by evaluating candidate solutions. Experiments checked out with standard datasets reveal that the proposed BIDEA performs better in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall and feature reduction than the competing feature selection methods.",

      "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown the powerful ability in text structure representation and effectively facilitate the task of text classification. However, challenges still exist in adapting GCN on learning discriminative features from texts due to the main issue of graph variants incurred by the textual complexity and diversity. In this paper, we propose a dual-attention GCN to model the structural information of various texts as well as tackle the graph-invariant problem through embedding two types of attention mechanisms, i.e. the connection-attention and hop-attention, into the classic GCN. To encode various connection patterns between neighbour words, connection-attention adaptively imposes different weights specified to neighbourhoods of each word, which captures the short-term dependencies. On the other hand, the hop-attention applies scaled coefficients to different scopes during the graph diffusion process to make the model learn more about the distribution of context, which captures long-term semantics in an adaptive way. Extensive experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets to evaluate our dual-attention GCN, and the achieved state-of-the-art performance verifies the effectiveness of dual-attention mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in finding better neural network designs. Sample-based NAS is the most reliable approach which aims at exploring the search space and evaluating the most promising architectures. However, it is computationally very costly. As a remedy, the one-shot approach has emerged as a popular technique for accelerating NAS using weight-sharing. However, due to the weight-sharing of vastly different networks, the one-shot approach is less reliable than the sample-based approach. In this work, we propose BONAS (Bayesian Optimized Neural Architecture Search), a sample-based NAS framework which is accelerated using weight-sharing to evaluate multiple related architectures simultaneously. Specifically, we apply Graph Convolutional Network predictor as a surrogate model for Bayesian Optimization to select multiple related candidate models in each iteration. We then apply weight-sharing to train multiple candidate models simultaneously. This approach not only accelerates the traditional sample-based approach significantly, but also keeps its reliability. This is because weight-sharing among related architectures are more reliable than those in the one-shot approach. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method over many competing algorithms.",

Stochastic gradient boosting could be adopted to accelerates gradient boosting by uniformly sampling training instances, but its estimator could introduce a high variance. This situation arises motivation for us to optimize gradient tree boosting. We combine gradient tree boosting with importance sampling, which achieves better performance by reducing the stochastic variance. Furthermore, we use a regularizer to improve the diagonal approximation in the Newton step of gradient boosting. The theoretical analysis supports that our strategies achieve a linear convergence rate on logistic loss. Empirical results show that our algorithm achieves a 2.5x--18x acceleration on two different gradient boosting algorithms (LogitBoost and LambdaMART) without appreciable performance loss.",

      "abstract": "Analysis of over-parameterized neural networks has drawn significant attention in recentyears. It was shown that such systems behave like convex systems under various restrictedsettings, such as for two-level neural networks, and when learning is only restricted locally inthe so-called neural tangent kernel space around specialized initializations. However, there areno theoretical techniques that can analyze fully trained deep neural networks encountered inpractice. This paper solves this fundamental problem by investigating such overparameterizeddeep neural networks when fully trained. We generalize a new technique called neural feature repopulation, originally introduced in (Fang et al., 2019a) for two-level neural networks, to analyze deep neural networks. It is shown that under suitable representations, overparameterized deep neural networks are inherently convex, and when optimized, the system can learn effective features suitable for the underlying learning task under mild conditions. This new analysis is consistent with empirical observations that deep neural networks are capable of learning efficient feature representations. Therefore, the highly unexpected result of this paper can satisfactorily explain the practical success of deep neural networks. Empirical studies confirm that predictions of our theory are consistent with results observed in practice.",

      "abstract": "Human neural motor system has the intelligence to learn new skills, and then to generalize these skills naturally. But it is not easy for a robot to demonstrate such intelligent behaviors. Inspired by the neural motor behaviors, a framework of broad learning based novel adaptive neural control is proposed in this article, such that in the presence of dynamic disturbance, robots can learn a set of basic skills and then generalize these skills to the neighboring movements naturally as our human motor system. This is achieved by incorporating the deterministic learning with the broad learning system that can accumulate and reuse the learned knowledge. The broad learning enabled adaptive neural control has been rigorously established in theory and tested in both simulation and experimental studies. Simulation results and performance of the Baxter robot in the experiments have shown the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the conventional adaptive neural control.",

      "abstract": "In the era of big data, mining the emotional tendency of opinions through natural language processing technology is meaningful for the timely understanding of human behavior data. Nowadays, Generalized Autoregressive Pre-training Language Modeling (XLNet) can not only capture bidirectional contextual knowledge but also learn the word dependency. However, its sentence-level representation didn't take broad features into account. In this paper, we design a novel architecture, called Broad Autoregressive Language Model (BroXLNet), to automatically process sentiment analysis task. BroXLNet integrates the advantage of generalized autoregressive language modeling and broad learning system, which has the ability of extracting deep contextual features and randomly searching high-level contextual representation in broad spaces. We evaluated our algorithm on binary Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., BiLSTM, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, BERT and XLNet, BroXLNet achieved the best result of 94.0% in sentiment analysis task of binary Stanford Sentiment Treebank. The result demonstrated the excellent classifying ability of BroXLNet in sentiment analysis.",

The Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT), an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) to the underwater environment, constitutes powerful technology for achieving the smart ocean. This article provides an overview of the UIoT with emphasis on current advances, future system architecture, applications, challenges, and open issues. The UIoT is enabled by the most recent developments in autonomous underwater vehicles, smart sensors, underwater communication technologies, and underwater routing protocols. In the coming years, the UIoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies for sensing the ocean, allowing it to become a smart network of interconnected underwater objects that has self-learning and intelligent computing capabilities. This article first provides a horizontal overview of the UIoT. Then, we present a five-layer system architecture for the future UIoT, which consists of a sensing, communication, networking, fusion, and application layer. Finally, we suggest the current challenges and the future UIoT research trends, in which cloud computing, fog computing, and artificial intelligence are combined.",

Although such kind of features has been successful in various datasets and applications, more general features (especially for the nonlinear features) are necessary for specific applications. Motivated by the powerful capability of the kernel methods, a novel expansion of broad learning system based on multiple kernels is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the nonlinear feature mappings in the form of multiple kernels are merged into the feature nodes of broad learning system. After that, the resulted features are further enhanced through nonlinear activation functions. The experimental results on UCI datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other methods.",

      "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in finding better neural network designs. Sample-based NAS is the most reliable approach which aims at exploring the search space and evaluating the most promising architectures. However, it is computationally very costly. As a remedy, the one-shot approach has emerged as a popular technique for accelerating NAS using weight-sharing. However, due to the weight-sharing of vastly different networks, the one-shot approach is less reliable than the sample-based approach. In this work, we propose BONAS (Bayesian Optimized Neural Architecture Search), a sample-based NAS framework which is accelerated using weight-sharing to evaluate multiple related architectures simultaneously. Specifically, we apply Graph Convolutional Network predictor as a surrogate model for Bayesian Optimization to select multiple related candidate models in each iteration. We then apply weight-sharing to train multiple candidate models simultaneously. This approach not only accelerates the traditional sample-based approach significantly, but also keeps its reliability. This is because weight-sharing among related architectures are more reliable than those in the one-shot approach. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method over many competing algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, emotion recognition has become a research focus in the area of artificial intelligence. Due to its irregular structure, EEG data can be analyzed by applying graphical based algorithms or models much more efficiently. In this work, a Graph Convolutional Broad Network (GCB-net) was designed for exploring the deeper-level information of graph-structured data. It used the graph convolutional layer to extract features of graph-structured input and stacks multiple regular convolutional layers to extract relatively abstract features. The final concatenation utilized the broad concept, which preserves the outputs of all hierarchical layers, allowing the model to search features in broad spaces. To improve the performance of the proposed GCB-net, the broad learning system (BLS) was applied to enhance its features. For comparison, two individual experiments were conducted to examine the efficiency of the proposed GCB-net based on the SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and DREAMER dataset respectively. In SEED, compared with other state-of-art methods, the GCB-net could better promote the accuracy (reaching 94.24 percent) on the DE feature of the all-frequency band. In DREAMER dataset, GCB-net performed better than other models with the same setting. Furthermore, the GCB-net reached high accuracies of 86.99, 89.32 and 89.20 percent on dimensions of Valence, Arousal and Dominance respectively. The experimental results showed the robust classifying ability of the GCB-net and BLS in EEG emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the graph-convolution networks have been used to solve the problem of skeleton-based action recognition. Previous works often adopted a structure-fixed graph to model the physical joints of human skeleton, but cannot well consider these interactions of different human parts (e.g., the right arm and the left leg) to some extent. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel structure-induced graph convolution network (Si-GCN) framework to boost the performance of the skeleton-based action recognition task. Given a video sequence of human skeletons, the Si-GCN can produce the sample-wise category in an end-to-end way. Specifically, according to the natural divisions of human body, we define a collection of intra-part graphs for each input human skeleton (i.e., each graph denotes a specific part/global of human skeleton), and then formulate an inter-graph to model the relationships of different intra-part graphs. The Si-GCN framework, which will then perform the spectral graph convolutions on these constructed intra/inter-part graphs, can not only capture the internal modalities of each human part/subgraph, but also consider the interactions/relationships between different human parts. A temporal convolution follows to model the temporal and spatial dynamics of the skeleton in combination with the characteristics of time and space. Comprehensive evaluations on two public datasets (including NTU RGB+D and HDM05) well demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Si-GCN when compared with existing skeleton-based action recognition approaches.",

      "abstract": "Convolution neural networks(CNN) and softmax loss(cross entropy) function have been widely used in various classification tasks. It achieves better performance than MSE and other loss. However in most classification tasks, because of the high dimension, excessive noise of input samples, strong coupling of the extracted features, as well as the complicated output-input projection relationship, the features extracted by CNN have large intra-class variance and small inter-class distance, so different class of samples cannot be distinguished well, which will greatly reduce the accuracy of the classification. Aiming at these problems, we combine the Fisher discrimination criterion with the neural network and propose a more discriminative feature learning algorithm, fisher loss. In the experiment, the proposed algorithm is compared with the center loss, island loss, and other algorithms on MNIST datasets with two commonly used network architecture. It is found that our algorithm can better distinguish features and achieve higher classification accuracy.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in video game AI, where the agents are located in a spatial grid-world environment and the number of agents varies both within and across episodes. The challenge is to flexibly control an arbitrary number of agents while achieving effective collaboration. Existing MARL methods usually suffer from the trade-off between these two considerations. To address the issue, we propose a novel architecture that learns a spatial joint representation of all the agents and outputs grid-wise actions. Each agent will be controlled independently by taking the action from the grid it occupies. By viewing the state information as a grid feature map, we employ a convolutional encoder-decoder as the policy network. This architecture naturally promotes agent communication because of the large receptive field provided by the stacked convolutional layers. Moreover, the spatially shared convolutional parameters enable fast parallel exploration that the experiences discovered by one agent can be immediately transferred to others. The proposed method can be conveniently integrated with general reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., PPO and Q-leaming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive challenging multi-agent tasks in StarCraft II. Copyright 2019 by the author(s).",

However, sufficiently labeled data are indispensable for extracting intertask relationships before transferring knowledge in classical supervised LML systems. Inadequate labels may deteriorate the performance due to the poor initial approximation. In order to extend the typical LML system, we propose a novel hierarchical lifelong learning algorithm (HLLA) consisting of two following layers: 1) the knowledge layer consisted of shared representations and integrated knowledge basis at the bottom and 2) parameterized hypothesis functions with features at the top. Unlabeled data is leveraged in HLLA for pretraining of the shared representations. We also have considered a selective inherited updating method to deal with intertask distribution shifting. Experiments show that our HLLA method outperforms many other recent LML algorithms, especially when dealing with higher dimensional, lower correlation, and fewer labeled data problems.",

      "abstract": "Robotic grasping has always been a challenging task for both service and industrial robots. The ability of grasp planning for novel objects is necessary for a robot to autonomously perform grasps under unknown environments. In this work, we consider the task of grasp planning for a parallel gripper to grasp a novel object, given an RGB image and its corresponding depth image taken from a single view. In this paper, we show that this problem can be simplified by modeling a novel object as a set of simple shape primitives, such as ellipses. We adopt fuzzy Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for novel objects' shape approximation. With the obtained GMM, we decompose the object into several ellipses, while each ellipse is corresponding to a grasping rectangle. After comparing the grasp quality among these rectangles, we will obtain the most proper part for a gripper to grasp. Extensive experiments on a real robotic platform demonstrate that our algorithm assists the robot to grasp a variety of novel objects with good grasp quality and computational efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The current study aimed to develop multiple diagnosis models for colorectal cancer (CRC) based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and analysis with artificial neural networks in order to enhance CRC diagnosis methods. A genetic algorithm and mean impact value were used to select genes to be used as numerical encoded parameters to reflect cancer metastasis or aggression. Back propagation and learning vector quantization neural networks were used to build four diagnosis models: Cancer/Normal, M0/M1, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) <5/≥5 and Clinical stage I-II/III-IV. The performance of each model was evaluated by predictive accuracy (ACC), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and a 10-fold cross-validation test. The ACC and AUC of the Cancer/Normal, M0/M1, CEA and Clinical stage models were 100%, 1.000; 87.14%, 0.670; 100%, 1.000; and 100%, 1.000, respectively. The 10-fold cross-validation test of the ACC values and sensitivity for each test were 93.75-99.39%, 1.0000; 80.58-88.24%, 0.9286-1.0000; 67.21-92.31%, 0.7091-1.0000; and 59.13-68.85%, 0.6017-0.6585, respectively. The diagnosis models developed in the current study combined gene expression profiling data and artificial intelligence algorithms to create tools for improved diagnosis of CRC.",

      "abstract": "Supervised models suffer from the problem of domain shifting where distribution mismatch in the data across domains greatly affect model performance. To solve the problem, training data selection (TDS) has been proven to be a prospective solution for domain adaptation in leveraging appropriate data. However, conventional TDS methods normally requires a predefined threshold which is neither easy to set nor can be applied across tasks, and models are trained separately with the TDS process. To make TDS self-adapted to data and task, and to combine it with model training, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that synchronously searches for training instances relevant to the target domain and learns better representations for them. A selection distribution generator (SDG) is designed to perform the selection and is updated according to the rewards computed from the selected data, where a predictor is included in the framework to ensure a task-specific model can be trained on the selected data and provides feedback to rewards. Experimental results from part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and sentiment analysis, as well as ablation studies, illustrate that the proposed framework is not only effective in data selection and representation, but also generalized to accommodate different NLP tasks.",

For dealing with tensor data, most existing methods vectorize them into vectors and lose most of the spatial information. For removing noise of the data, most existing methods focus on the input space and lack consideration of the projection space. Aiming at preserving the spatial information of tensor data, we incorporate tensor mode-d product with low-rank matrices for self-representation. At the same time, we remove noise of the data in both the input space and the projection space, and obtain a robust affinity matrix for spectral clustering. Extensive experiments on several popular subspace clustering datasets show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional subspace clustering methods and recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods.",

      "abstract": "Many researchers come up with speed guidance models applied to intersection in order to improve the traffic efficiency at intersection and reduce the vehicle emission. However, most of the speed guidance models are single car models with complex parameters and low compute efficiency. This paper presents a traffic platoon speed guidance strategy based on &amp;ldquo;Time Block&amp;rdquo;. It can realize the Inter-Vehicle Communication as well as providing a proper speed to the vehicle driver according to the signal lamp and vehicle's real-time position information. The simulation results show that this model can be applied to different saturation sections and it can efficiently reduce average traffic delay by around 35.0%, reduce hydrocarbon emissions by 52.7%, and reduce the CO emissions by 29.1%. What's more, it also can cause 23.4% reduction of accident rate.",

In recent years, it has become a key tool in black-box adversarial attack to neural network based image classifiers. However, existing zeroth-order optimization algorithms rarely extract second-order information of the model function. In this paper, we utilize the second-order information of the objective function and propose a novel \\textit{Hessian-aware zeroth-order algorithm} called \\texttt{ZO-HessAware}. Our theoretical result shows that \\texttt{ZO-HessAware} has an improved zeroth-order convergence rate and query complexity under structured Hessian approximation, where we propose a few approximation methods for estimating Hessian. Our empirical studies on the black-box adversarial attack problem validate that our algorithm can achieve improved success rates with a lower query complexity.",

      "abstract": "Combining cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) has been proven effective in motion tracking, as these two sensing modalities offer complementary characteristics that are suitable for fusion. While most works focus on global-shutter cameras and synchronized sensor measurements, consumer-grade devices are mostly equipped with rolling-shutter cameras and suffer from imperfect sensor synchronization. In this work, we propose a nonlinear optimization-based monocular visual inertial odometry (VIO) with varying camera-IMU time offset modeled as an unknown variable. Our approach is able to handle the rolling-shutter effects and imperfect sensor synchronization in a unified way. Additionally, we introduce an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming and red-black tree to speed up IMU integration over variable-length time intervals during the optimization. An uncertainty-aware initialization is also presented to launch the VIO robustly. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on the Euroc dataset and mobile phone data are shown to validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, research on facial expression recognition (FER) has become an increasingly active research topic. Deep learning is a new area, which gives a new way to classify images of human faces into emotion categories. However, it faces many difficulties caused by poor robustness and real-time performance. This paper designs a new architecture network based on Broad Learning System (BLS) for facial expressions recognition. It is established as a flat network. The original inputs are transferred and placed as mapped features in feature nodes, while the structure is expanded in wide sense in the enhancement nodes. To evaluate our architecture we tested the proposed method with the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+). The experimental results show that the BLS approach is very effective in facial expression recognition to compare with convolutional neural networks.",

      "abstract": "Regularized online learning is widely used in machine learning applications. In online learning, performing exact minimization ($i.e.,$ implicit update) is known to be beneficial to the numerical stability and structure of solution. In this paper we study a class of regularized online algorithms without linearizing the loss function or the regularizer, which we call \\emph{fully implicit online learning} (FIOL). We show that for arbitrary Bregman divergence, FIOL has the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for general convex setting and $O(\\log T)$ regret for strongly convex setting, and the regret has an one-step improvement effect because it avoids the approximation error of linearization. Then we propose efficient algorithms to solve the subproblem of FIOL. We show that even if the solution of the subproblem has no closed form, it can be solved with complexity comparable to the linearized online algoritms. Experiments validate the proposed approaches.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep manifold-to-manifold transforming network (DMT-Net), which makes SPD matrices flow from one Riemannian manifold to another more discriminative one. For discriminative feature learning, two specific layers on manifolds are developed: (i) the local SPD convolutional layer, (ii) the non-linear SPD activation layer, where positive definiteness is satisfied for both two layers. Further, to relieve computational burden of kernels on relative large-scale data, we design a batch-kernelized layer to favor batchwise kernel optimization of deep networks. Specifically, one reference set dynamically changing with the network training is introduced to break the limitation of memory size. We evaluate our proposed method on action recognition datasets, where input signals are popularly modeled as SPD matrices. The experimental results demonstrate that our DMT-Net is more competitive than state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries are a key technology in today&rsquo;s world and improving their performances requires, in many cases, the use of cathodes operating above the anodic stability of state-of-the-art electrolytes based on ethylene carbonate (EC) mixtures. EC, however, is a crucial component of electrolytes, due to its excellent ability to allow graphite anode operation - also required for high energy density batteries -by stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the last years, many alternative electrolytes, aiming at allowing high voltage battery operation, have been proposed. However, often, graphite electrode operation is not well demonstrated in these electrolytes. Thus, we review here the high voltage, EC-free alternative electrolytes, focusing on those allowing the steady operation of graphite anodes. This review covers electrolyte compositions, with the widespread use of additives, the change in main lithium salt, the effect of anion (or Li salt) concentration, but also reports on graphite protection strategies, by coatings or artificial SEI or by use of water-soluble binder for electrode processing as these can also enable the use of graphite in electrolytes with suboptimal intrinsic SEI formation ability.&lt;/p&gt;",

The influence of BNI amount, polymerization temperature, solvent, and initiator on the polymerization was studied. Results showed that the more organic catalyst, higher reaction temperature, highly polar solvent, and higher activity initiator led to shorter inhibition period and faster polymerization. More importantly, the mechanism for the shorter inhibition period and faster polymerization with BNI was proposed: Poly(methyl methacrylate) with predetermined molar mass and relatively low M w /M n (determined by size exclusion chromatography, SEC) was successfully synthesized. Furthermore, the structure of resulting polymers was characterized using 1H NMR The living/controlled feature of the polymers was further demonstrated by the chain extension experiment. Attractive features of this procedure include commercially available catalyst, ease of operation, and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "This paper is to design substitution boxes (S-Boxes) using innovative I-Ching operators (ICOs) that have evolved from ancient Chinese I-Ching philosophy. These three operators-intrication, turnover, and mutual- inherited from I-Ching are specifically designed to generate S-Boxes in cryptography. In order to analyze these three operators, identity, compositionality, and periodicity measures are developed. All three operators are only applied to change the output positions of Boolean functions. Therefore, the bijection property of S-Box is satisfied automatically. It means that our approach can avoid singular values, which is very important to generate S-Boxes. Based on the periodicity property of the ICOs, a new network is constructed, thus to be applied in the algorithm for designing S-Boxes. To examine the efficiency of our proposed approach, some commonly used criteria are adopted, such as nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, differential approximation probability, and linear approximation probability. The comparison results show that S-Boxes designed by applying ICOs have a higher security and better performance compared with other schemes. Furthermore, the proposed approach can also be used to other practice problems in a similar way.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a brain-robot interface (BRI)-based control strategy in combination with the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to achieve the navigation and control of a mobile robot in uncertain environments. The BRI is based on steady state visually evoked potentials, utilizing the multivariate synchronization index classification algorithm to analyze the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals in such a manner that human intentions can be recognized and motion commands can be produced for the brain controlled robot. The entire system is semi-autonomous since the navigation of mobile robot is commanded by the BRI, and the low-level motion of the mobile robot is autonomous with a designed kinematic controller. By utilizing vanishing points and door plates as the environmental features, a global metric map of the environment has been built by a sequential SLAM algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is the combination of an artificial potential field (APF) and the brain signals, which builds up the relationship between the strength of EEG signals and the intensity of the potential field. Through the proposed EEG-APF method, motion commands that would plan an obstacle-free trajectory in un-structured environments, can be obtained. The entire system has been tested with eight volunteer subjects, and all subjects are able to successfully fulfill manipulating mobile robot in the experiments.",

      "abstract": "In the task of quantifiable sequence editing (QuaSE), a model needs to edit an input sentence to generate an output that satisfies a given outcome, which is a numerical value measuring a certain property of the output. For example, for review sentences, the outcome could be review ratings; for advertisement, the outcome could be click-through rate. We propose a framework which performs QuaSE by incorporating pseudo-parallel data. Our framework can capture the content similarity and the outcome differences by exploiting pseudo-parallel sentence pairs, which enables a better disentanglement of the latent factors that are relevant to the outcome and thus provides a solid basis to generate output satisfying the desired outcome. The dual reconstruction structure further enhances the capability of generating expected output by exploiting the coupling of latent factors of pseudo-parallel sentences. We prepare a dataset of Yelp review sentences with the ratings as outcome. Experimental results show that our framework can outperform state-of-the-art methods under both sentiment polarity accuracy and target value errors.",

      "abstract": "We propose the task of Quantifiable Sequence Editing (QuaSE): editing an input sequence to generate an output sequence that satisfies a given numerical outcome value measuring a certain property of the sequence, with the requirement of keeping the main content of the input sequence. For example, an input sequence could be a word sequence, such as review sentence and advertisement text. For a review sentence, the outcome could be the review rating; for an advertisement, the outcome could be the click-through rate. The major challenge in performing QuaSE is how to perceive the outcome-related wordings, and only edit them to change the outcome. In this paper, the proposed framework contains two latent factors, namely, outcome factor and content factor, disentangled from the input sentence to allow convenient editing to change the outcome and keep the content. Our framework explores the pseudo-parallel sentences by modeling their content similarity and outcome differences to enable a better disentanglement of the latent factors, which allows generating an output to better satisfy the desired outcome and keep the content. The dual reconstruction structure further enhances the capability of generating expected output by exploiting the couplings of latent factors of pseudo-parallel sentences. For evaluation, we prepared a dataset of Yelp review sentences with the ratings as outcome. Extensive experimental results are reported and discussed to elaborate the peculiarities of our framework.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing number of the non-English Web in recent years. So the language-dependent and user-based search paradigms are becoming increasingly important for search engines. Unfortunately, most of the works are available on web search analysis are still English-based. In order to understand the behavioural commonality and distinction of non-English users, we propose a framework for analysing the web search behaviours of users in a cross-lingual context. This framework is composed of 10 factors, which can be applied at the query level, session level and corpus level respectively. The integral employment of these factors could help us with characterising the user behaviour of web search, even in different languages, with regard to both statistical and semantic perspectives. This framework shows a better efficiency not only in revealing the commonality and distinction of web search, but also in informing the design of search paradigms in a cross-lingual scenario.",

      "abstract": "Self-attention networks have proven to be of profound value for its strength of capturing global dependencies. In this work, we propose to model localness for self-attention networks, which enhances the ability of capturing useful local context. We cast localness modeling as a learnable Gaussian bias, which indicates the central and scope of the local region to be paid more attention. The bias is then incorporated into the original attention distribution to form a revised distribution. To maintain the strength of capturing long distance dependencies while enhance the ability of capturing short-range dependencies, we only apply localness modeling to lower layers of self-attention networks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed approach.",

As applications of this result for Q-divisors, we prove results on base-pointfreeness and very-ampleness of the adjoint linear system |KS + D|. These results can be viewed as&#13;\\nrefinements of previous results on smooth surfaces of Ein-Lazarsfeld [EL93] and Ma¸sek [Ma¸s99].",

In this work, we propose to augment NMT models with a very light-weight cache-like memory network, which stores recent hidden representations as translation history. The probability distribution over generated words is updated online depending on the translation history retrieved from the memory, endowing NMT models with the capability to dynamically adapt over time. Experiments on multiple domains with different topics and styles show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with negligible impact on the computational cost.",

      "abstract": "Emotion is closely related to healthy and abnormal mood is the alarm of our body. This paper is concentrated on the objective and accurate emotion classification using EEG signal. We propose emotional patches and combine it with the deep belief network(DBN) to achieve high-precision emotion classification. DBN is able to fit the distribution of the EEG signal and mapping the extracted feature to the higher-level characteristics space where we can easily perform high-precision classification. Compared with the other method, our method uses the emotional patches which have considered the temporal information of emotion and reduce the influence of noise. In addition, our model doesn't need to be trained twice to complete higher classification accuracy. We divide the EEG signal and choose the vital β frequency band where we perform feature extraction. Based on the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset(SEED), we perform the emotion classification experiment and compare our method with the commonly used classifiers such as SVM, LR and CCA ect. The experimental result demonstrates that our method achieves the highest classification accuracy and outperform the state-of-theart emotion classification approaches based on EEG.",

      "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal based emotion recognition, as a challenging pattern recognition task, has attracted more and more attention in recent years and widely used in medical, Affective Computing and other fields. Traditional approaches often lack of the high-level features and the generalization ability is poor, which are difficult to apply to the practical application. In this paper, we proposed a novel model for multi-subject emotion classification. The basic idea is to extract the high-level features through the deep learning model and transform traditional subject-independent recognition tasks into multi-subject recognition tasks. Experiments are carried out on the DEAP dataset, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices (e.g., covariances, graph Laplacians, etc.) are widely used to model the relationship of spatial or temporal domain. Nevertheless, SPD matrices are theoretically embedded on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep manifold-to-manifold transforming network (DMT-Net) which can make SPD matrices flow from one Riemannian manifold to another more discriminative one. To learn discriminative SPD features characterizing both spatial and temporal dependencies, we specifically develop three novel layers on manifolds: (i) the local SPD convolutional layer, (ii) the non-linear SPD activation layer, and (iii) the Riemannian-preserved recursive layer. The SPD property is preserved through all layers without any requirement of singular value decomposition (SVD), which is often used in the existing methods with expensive computation cost. Furthermore, a diagonalizing SPD layer is designed to efficiently calculate the final metric for the classification task. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the task of action recognition, where input signals are popularly modeled as SPD matrices. The experimental results demonstrate that our DMT-Net is much more competitive over state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Automatic Facial Action Unit (AU) detection has drawn more and more attention over the past years due to its significance to facial expression analysis. Frontal-view AU detection has been extensively evaluated, but cross-pose AU detection is a less-touched problem due to the scarcity of the related dataset. The challenge of Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis (FERA2017) just released a large-scale videobased AU detection dataset across different facial poses. To deal with this challenging task, we develop a simple and efficient deep learning based system to detect AU occurrence under nine different facial views. In this system, we first crop out facial images by using morphology operations including binary segmentation, connected components labeling and region boundaries extraction, then for each type of AU, we train a corresponding expert network by specifically fine-tuning the VGG-Face network on cross-view facial images, so as to extract more discriminative features for the subsequent binary classification. In the AU detection sub-challenge, our proposed method achieves the mean accuracy of 77.8% (vs. the baseline 56.1%), and promotes the F1 score to 57.4% (vs. the baseline 45.2%).",

An adaptive method for disperse centroids is proposed to improve the stability and accuracy of the clustering result. The Adaptively Disperse Centroids K-means Algorithm (ADC-K-means) is implemented using MapReduce model on hadoop platform, and it is compared with the k-means of Mahout which is a sub-project of hadoop. The experimental result shows that proposed algorithm is effective.",

      "abstract": "The Stochastic Context Tree (SCOT) is a useful tool for studying infinite random sequences generated by an m-Markov Chain (m-MC). It captures the phenomenon that the probability distribution of the next state sometimes depends on less than m of the preceding states. This allows compressing the information needed to describe an m-MC. The SCOT construction has been earlier used under various names: VLMC, VOMC, PST, CTW. In this paper we study the possibility of reducing the m-MC to a 1-MC on the leaves of the SCOT. Such context trees are called perfect-memory. We give various combinatorial characterizations of perfect-memory context trees and an efficient algorithm to find the minimal perfect-memory extension of a SCOT.",

      "abstract": "A major progress in deep multilayer neural networks (DNNs) is the invention of various unsupervised pretraining methods to initialize network parameters which lead to good prediction accuracy. This paper presents the sparseness analysis on the hidden unit in the pretraining process. In particular, we use the L<sub>1</sub> -norm to measure sparseness and provide some sufficient conditions for that pretraining leads to sparseness with respect to the popular pretraining models-such as denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). Our experimental results demonstrate that when the sufficient conditions are satisfied, the pretraining models lead to sparseness. Our experiments also reveal that when using the sigmoid activation functions, pretraining plays an important sparseness role in DNNs with sigmoid (Dsigm), and when using the rectifier linear unit (ReLU) activation functions, pretraining becomes less effective for DNNs with ReLU (Drelu). Luckily, Drelu can reach a higher recognition accuracy than DNNs with pretraining (DAEs and RBMs), as it can capture the main benefit (such as sparseness-encouraging) of pretraining in Dsigm. However, ReLU is not adapted to the different firing rates in biological neurons, because the firing rate actually changes along with the varying membrane resistances. To address this problem, we further propose a family of rectifier piecewise linear units (RePLUs) to fit the different firing rates. The experimental results show that the performance of RePLU is better than ReLU, and is comparable with those with some pretraining techniques, such as RBMs and DAEs.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, a novel cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) method using domain-adaptive least-squares regression (DaLSR) model is proposed. In this method, an additional unlabeled data set from target speech corpus is used to serve as an auxiliary data set and combined with the labeled training data set from source speech corpus for jointly training the DaLSR model. In contrast to the traditional least-squares regression (LSR) method, the major novelty of DaLSR is that it is able to handle the mismatch problem between source and target speech corpora. Hence, the proposed DaLSR method is very suitable for coping with cross-corpus SER problem. For evaluating the performance of the proposed method in dealing with the cross-corpus SER problem, we conduct extensive experiments on three emotional speech corpora and compare the results with several state-of-the-art transfer learning methods that are widely used for cross-corpus SER problem. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recognition accuracies than the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "An innovative simulated evolutionary algorithm (EA), called I-Ching divination EA (IDEA), and its convergence analysis are proposed and investigated in this paper. Inherited from ancient Chinese culture, I-Ching divination has always been used as a divination system in traditional and modern China. There are three operators evolved from I-Ching transformations in this new optimization algorithm, intrication operator, turnover operator, and mutual operator. These new operators are very flexible in the evolution procedure. Additionally, two new spaces are defined in this paper, which are denoted as hexagram space and state space. In order to analyze the convergence property of I-Ching divination algorithm, Markov model was adopted to analyze the characters of the operators. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm is proved to be a homogeneous Markov chain with the positive transition matrix. After giving some basic concepts of necessary theorems, definition of admissible functions and I-Ching map, a precise proof of the states converge to the global optimum is presented. Compared with the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and differential evolution algorithm, our proposed IDEA is much faster in reaching the global optimum.",

We propose two $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularized maximum likelihood estimators to learn the model parameters from i.i.d. samples. The first one is a joint MLE estimator which estimates all the parameters simultaneously. The second one is a node-wise conditional MLE estimator which estimates the parameters for each node individually. For both estimators, statistical analysis shows that under mild conditions the extra flexibility gained by the additive exponential family models comes at almost no cost of statistical efficiency. A Monte-Carlo approximation method is developed to efficiently optimize the proposed estimators. The advantages of our estimators over Gaussian graphical models and Nonparanormal estimators are demonstrated on synthetic and real data sets.",

In scene classification, effective feature selection can significantly boost the final performance. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-based feature-selection method is proposed, which formulates the feature-selection problem as a feature reconstruction problem. Note that the popular deep-learning technique, i.e., the deep belief network (DBN), achieves feature abstraction by minimizing the reconstruction error over the whole feature set, and features with smaller reconstruction errors would hold more feature intrinsics for image representation. Therefore, the proposed method selects features that are more reconstructible as the discriminative features. Specifically, an iterative algorithm is developed to adapt the DBN to produce the inquired reconstruction weights. In the experiments, 2800 remote sensing scene images of seven categories are collected for performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Unlike the previous approaches that rely on word embeddings, our method learns embeddings of small text regions from unlabeled data for integration into a supervised CNN. The proposed scheme for embedding learning is based on the idea of two-view semi-supervised learning, which is intended to be useful for the task of interest even though the training is done on unlabeled data. Our models achieve better results than previous approaches on sentiment classification and topic classification tasks.",

We prove its usefulness in supervised learning under certain conditions. The result explains the effectiveness of some existing methods such as word embedding. Based on this theory, we propose a new semi-supervised learning framework that learns a multi-view embedding of small text regions with convolutional neural networks. The method derived from this framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on sentiment classification and topic categorization.",

This paper studies CNN on text categorization to exploit the 1D structure (namely, word order) of text data for accurate prediction. Instead of using low-dimensional word vectors as input as is often done, we directly apply CNN to high-dimensional text data, which leads to directly learning embedding of small text regions for use in classification. In addition to a straightforward adaptation of CNN from image to text, a simple but new variation which employs bag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer is proposed. An extension to combine multiple convolution layers is also explored for higher accuracy. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a method of the UAV path planing in the complex environment by using artificial potential field and differential game theory is introduced. This article studies the pursuit evasion game of the dynamic path planing for the UAV. The fly zone of either the pursuer or the evader is divided into two categories, namely the obstacle areas and the obstacle-free areas. So we can use the artificial potential field in the obstacle areas,and we use differential game theory in the obstacle-free areas for the UAV. This method can apply to pursuit-evasion game in the complex environment for the UAV path planing.Not only the UAV can avoid obstacles but also they can find the best capture path.Finally,the simulation results verify its correctness and validity .",

      "abstract": "This paper develops an novel evolutionary algorithm, I Ching algorithm (ICA) for solving optimization problems. The new algorithm employs an novel method by implying new operators from I Ching, which comes from ancient Chinese culture. There are some transformation methods such as a penalty method and a multiplier method. The penalty method is often used to solve optimization problems, because the solutions are often near the boundary of the feasible set and the method is used easily for its simplicity. In design the ICA, three operators - mutation operator, turnover operator, and mutual operator were developed by the authors based on the concept of I Ching transformations. These new operators are very flexible and search on the designed I Ching network in the evolution procedure. The proposed algorithm was applied to solving two optimization benchmark functions, Booth function and Hump function. Then, we compare the performance of ICA with genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed I Ching algorithm performs better than genetic algorithm in reaching the global optimum. It is much faster than those of genetic algorithms. Additionally, the ICA is also a universal method, which is suitable to different optimization problems.",

This method consists of two steps: two-hand positional information extraction and gesture recognition. In the first step, we utilize the Kinect depth image to acquire the position of both hands. The second step is the highlight of the proposed method, it locates the palms by hand nodes, extracts the right hand movement information which is trained by a Hidden Markov Model. This method has been verified by a experimental car control system and demonstrated good robustness in complex background environment.",

      "abstract": "In this work, a multilevel thresholding approach that uses modified bacterial foraging optimization (MBFO) is presented for enhancing the applicability and practicality of optimal thresholding techniques. First, the diversity of solutions is considered during the reproduction step. Each weak bacterium randomly selects a strong bacterium from the healthiest bacteria, attempts to reach a location near the chosen strong bacterium, and maintains the same direction. Particle swarm optimization is subsequently incorporated into each chemotactic step to strengthen the global searching capability and quicken the convergence rate of the bacterial foraging algorithm. Finally, the optimal thresholds are obtained by maximizing the Tsallis thresholding functions using the proposed MBFO algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm in solving complex stochastic optimization problems is compared with other popular approaches such as a bacterial foraging algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, and genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the optimal thresholds produced using MBFO require less computation time. In addition, MBFO method can achieve significantly better segmentation results; the devised algorithm generates more stable results, and the proposed method performs better than the other algorithms in terms of multilevel thresholding.",

      "abstract": "The efficient planning and design of water networks, as well as the management and strategies of existing water supply systems, require accurate short-term water demand forecasts. In this study, a statistical model for the estimation of daily urban water consumption was developed. The model was applied to analyse and forecast the daily water consumption in the main district of Beijing, China, from 2006 to 2010. The model exhibited good performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, greater than 0.9 in both the calibration and validation periods. The results indicate that: (a) the 7-day moving average temperature is an efficient variable that can be used to depict water-use variation in a year; (b) a daily maximum temperature of 31.1°C and the occurrence of precipitation are two thresholds of water-use behaviour; and (c) the current day's water consumption has a strong correlation with the consumption of one, two and seven days ago.Editor Z.W.

      "abstract": "Because gene expression profiles in normal cells are different from those of cancer cells, experimental results of the tests can diagnose a cancerous person. However, the gene data are usually with high variable dependent, high dimensional, and very noisy. It is not appropriate to use the original data to train or to test the forecasting model. Depending on the unique properties of the genes expression data, a new statistical dimension reduction method called horizon-vertical dimension reduction method (HVDRM) is developed in this paper. The feature set dimension is reduced from 2000 to 5 by applying HVDRM. Then, the extracted feature set is arranged to train in an artificial neural network (ANN) and a fuzzy neural network (FNN). Keep these two trained models, which is then send to the classification system to examine whether the testing sample is normal or not. Three kinds of experiments are conducted to test the validity, namely, original data for an ANN, reduction feature data for an ANN, and reduced feature data for a FNN. It is found that the testing accuracy of the FNN has the best result. It is concluded that the proposed HVDRM is an effective method to extract feature data and the FNN is more suitable than ANN in the given cancer cell gene detection as the forecasting model.",

The standard methods employ boosted decision trees such as Adaboost for exponential loss and Friedman's gradient boosting for general loss. In contrast to these traditional boosting algorithms that treat a tree learner as a black box, the method we propose directly learns decision forests via fully-corrective regularized greedy search using the underlying forest structure. Our method achieves higher accuracy and smaller models than gradient boosting on many of the datasets we have tested on.",

This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget, how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the out-of-sample error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular, we derive a deterministic out-of-sample error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data, and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is a combinational problem, we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 1",

We provide the first efficient algorithm with an optimal regret. Our algorithm uses a cost sensitive classification learner as an oracle and has a running time $\\mathrm{polylog}(N)$, where $N$ is the number of classification rules among which the oracle might choose. This is exponentially faster than all previous algorithms that achieve optimal regret in this setting. Our formulation also enables us to create an algorithm with regret that is additive rather than multiplicative in feedback delay as in all previous work.",

      "abstract": "This work considers the problem of learning the structure of multivariate linear tree models, which include a variety of directed tree graphical models with continuous, discrete, and mixed latent variables such as linear-Gaussian models, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models, and Markov evolutionary trees. The setting is one where we only have samples from certain observed variables in the tree, and our goal is to estimate the tree structure (i.e., the graph of how the underlying hidden variables are connected to each other and to the observed variables). We propose the Spectral Recursive Grouping algorithm, an efficient and simple bottom-up procedure for recovering the tree structure from independent samples of the observed variables. Our finite sample size bounds for exact recovery of the tree structure reveal certain natural dependencies on underlying statistical and structural properties of the underlying joint distribution. Furthermore, our sample complexity guarantees have no explicit dependence on the dimensionality of the observed variables, making the algorithm applicable to many high-dimensional settings. At the heart of our algorithm is a spectral quartet test for determining the relative topology of a quartet of variables from second-order statistics. 1",

Web portals can be enhanced by high performance Geocomputation and emerging Internet technologies to improve performance, interoperability, reliability, usability, and security. The integration of emerging technologies introduces new challenges for designing efficient and flexible high performance GIS web portals. This paper summarizes design principles for the development of high performance web portals to support GIScience research. Following the design principles, a technical implementation plan of a web portal to support GIScience research at a geography department is outlined using state-of-the-art computing technologies, including high performance computing, Web services, Internet GIServices, and web portals. A simple prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the technical plan as well as the effectiveness of the design principles.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method for semi-supervised learning on high dimensional nonlinear manifolds, which includes a phase of unsupervised basis learning and a phase of supervised function learning. The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods. 1",

Each grid in the map is flagged with floor or obstacle and contains a value telling the height of the floor or obstacle. At first we use sensor data build and update 3D occupancy grid and floor grid. Then the map for navigation is built under the combination of two grids. We verified our approach on the platform of simulation and the result testified that the method is able to generate the map for path planning and collision avoidance.",

      "abstract": "The ranking problem has become increasingly important in modern applications of statistical methods in automated decision making systems. In particular, we consider a formulation of the statistical ranking problem which we call subset ranking, and focus on the discounted cumulated gain (DCG) criterion that measures the quality of items near the top of the rank-list. Similar to error minimization for binary classification, direct optimization of natural ranking criteria such as DCG leads to a nonconvex optimization problems that can be NP-hard. Therefore, a computationally more tractable approach is needed. We present bounds that relate the approximate optimization of DCG to the approximate minimization of certain regression errors. These bounds justify the use of convex learning formulations for solving the subset ranking problem. The resulting estimation methods are not conventional, in that we focus on the estimation quality in the top-portion of the rank-list. We further investigate the asymptotic statistical behavior of these formulations. Under appropriate conditions, the consistency of the estimation schemes with respect to the DCG metric can be derived. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel online relevant set algorithm for a linearly scored block sequence translation model. The key component is a new procedure to directly optimize the global scoring function used by a statistical machine translation (SMT) decoder. This training procedure treats the decoder as a black-box, and thus can be used to optimize any decoding scheme. The novel algorithm is evaluated using different feature types: 1) commonly used probabilistic features, such as translation, language, or distortion model probabilities, and 2) binary features. In particular, encouraging results on a standard Arabic-English translation task are presented for a translation system that uses only binary feature functions. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel training algorithm, a detailed comparison with the widely used minimum-error-rate (MER) training algorithm is presented using the same decoder and feature set. The online algorithm is simplified by introducing so-called \"seed\" block sequences which enable the training to be carried out without a gold standard block translation. While the online training algorithm is extremely fast, it also improves translation scores over the MER algorithm in some experiments. © 2008 IEEE.",

Previous works focused on short time features, which cannot capture some essential long term characteristics of singing. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Time Warping based unsupervised segmentation algorithm to divide a pop song into homogeneous segments, which contain either vocal or pure music sound. This procedure makes it possible to design long term feature or classification schema to improve the accuracy of vocal part detection. We also present a segment level classification schema based on the result of segmentation. It will be shown that the classification accuracy is significantly improved.",

Our approach is based on optimization of quadratic upper bounds of the loss functions which allows us to present a rigorous convergence analysis of the algorithm. More importantly, this general framework enables us to use a standard regression base learner such as decision trees for fitting any loss function. We illustrate an application of the proposed method in learning ranking functions for Web search by combining both preference data and labeled data for training. We present experimental results for Web search using data from a commercial search engine that show significant improvements of our proposed methods over some existing methods.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we present a novel training method for a localized phrase-based prediction model for statistical machine translation (SMT). The model predicts block neighbors to carry out a phrase-based translation that explicitly handles local phrase reordering. We use a maximum likelihood criterion to train a log-linear block bigram model which uses real-valued features (e.g., a language model score) as well as binary features based on the block identities themselves (e.g., block bigram features). The model training relies on an efficient enumeration of local block neighbors in parallel training data. A novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training algorithm is presented that can easily handle millions of features. Moreover, when viewing SMT as a block generation process, it becomes quite similar to sequential natural language annotation problems such as part-of-speech tagging, phrase chunking, or shallow parsing. Our novel approach is successfully tested on a standard Arabic-English translation task using two different phrase reordering models: a block orientation model and a phrase-distortion model.",

Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don't have a complete understanding of their effectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Specifically we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classifiers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting.",

This paper focuses on the development of a computing algorithm that uses audio and visual sensors to detect and track a user's affective state to aid computer decision making. Using our Multi-stream Fused Hidden Markov Model (MFHMM), we analyzed coupled audio and visual streams to detect 11 cognitive/emotive states. The MFHMM allows the building of an optimal connection among multiple streams according to the maximum entropy principle and the maximum mutual information criterion. Person-independent experimental results from 20 subjects in 660 sequences show that the MFHMM approach performs with an accuracy of 80.61% which outperforms face-only HMM, pitch-only HMM, energy-only HMM, and independent HMM fusion.",

The five-tier architecture suggested here can support advanced semantic search and query functions for distributed GIServices by combining Grid computing, Semantic Web, and software agent technologies. The design of the web portal user interface with software agents can help end users combine and integrate computing power with geospatial data and services. Geospatial ontologies are incorporated into the framework by using geographic web ontology language (G-OWL). Intelligent software agent (GeoAgent) techniques are used to automate the procedures for searching, retrieving and processing geospatial data. The proposed Internet GIService architecture will provide a blue print for the establishment of Grid-enabled Internet GIServices and will help the GIS community to identify potential technical challenges to implement intelligent Internet GIServices.",

      "abstract": "In machine learning, whether one can build a more accurate classifier by using unlabeled data (semi-supervised learning) is an important issue. Although a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks is not always clear. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning paradigm which we call structural learning. The idea is to find \"what good classifiers are like\" by learning from thousands of automatically generated auxiliary classification problems on unlabeled data. By doing so, the common predictive structure shared by the multiple classification problems can be discovered, which can then be used to improve performance on the target problem. The method produces performance higher than the previous best results on CoNLL'00 syntactic chunking and CoNLL'03 named entity chunking (English and German).",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel training method for a localized phrase-based prediction model for statistical machine translation (SMT). The model predicts blocks with orientation to handle local phrase re-ordering. We use a maximum likelihood criterion to train a log-linear block bigram model which uses realvalued features (e.g. a language model score) as well as binary features based on the block identities themselves, e.g. block bigram features. Our training algorithm can easily handle millions of features. The best system obtains a 18.6% improvement over the baseline on a standard Arabic-English translation task. © 2005 Association for Computational Linguistics.",

The human multi-sensor affect system defines the expectation of multimodal affect analyzer. In this paper, we present our efforts toward audio-visual HCI-related affect recognition. With HCI applications in mind, we take into account some special affective states which indicate users' cognitive/motivational states. Facing the fact that a facial expression is influenced by both an affective state and speech content, we apply a smoothing method to extract the information of the affective state from facial features. In our fusion stage, a voting method is applied to combine audio and visual modalities so that the final affect recognition accuracy is greatly improved. We test our bimodal affect recognition approach on 38 subjects with 11 HCI-related affect states. The extensive experimental results show that the average person-dependent affect recognition accuracy is almost 90% for our bimodal fusion.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to automatically recognize emotion which children exhibit in an intelligent tutoring system. Emotion recognition can assist the computer agent to adapt its tutorial strategies to improve the efficiency of knowledge transmission. In this study, we detect three emotional classes: confidence, puzzle, and hesitation. Emotion is detected by means of lexical, prosodic, spectral, and syntactic analyses of users’ speech. An automatic speech recognition system serves as the fundamental constituent of the system. A robust classification and regression tree (CART) integrates the various information sources together for final decision. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been tested on data collected by Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiments. Our emotion recognition was speaker-independent, and yielded 91.3% accuracy. The test results showed that the spectral and duration-related prosodic features played very important roles in emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Contrast is a very popular phenomenon in spoken language, and carries very important information to help understanding contents and structures of spoken language. In this paper, we propose an idea of automatic contrast detection as an effort for better speech understanding. We study the automatic tagging of three specific types of contrast: symmetric contrast, contrastive focus, and contrastive topic. We label the three types of contrasted words as contrast (C), and other words as noncontrast (¬C). The classification of contrast events is based on prosodic, spectral, and part-of-speech (POS) information sources. The integration of different knowledge sources is realized by a time-delay recursive neural network (TDRNN). The approach we proposed was testified on 235 spontaneous utterances consisting of 3500 words (samples). The contrast detection was speaker independent. The tests yielded an average of 87.9% classification rate.",

      "abstract": "We devise a boosting approach to classification and regression based on column generation using a mixture of kernels. Traditional kernel methods construct models based on a single positive semi-definite kernel with the type of kernel predefined and kernel parameters chosen according to cross-validation performance. Our approach creates models that are mixtures of a library of kernel models, and our algorithm automatically determines kernels to be used in the final model. The 1-norm and 2-norm regularization methods are employed to restrict the ensemble of kernel models. The proposed method produces sparser solutions, and thus significantly reduces the testing time. By extending the column generation (CG) optimization which existed for linear programs with 1-norm regularization to quadratic programs with 2-norm regularization, we are able to solve many learning formulations by leveraging various algorithms for constructing single kernel models. By giving different priorities to columns to be generated, we are able to scale CG boosting to large datasets. Experimental results on benchmark data are included to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

The CINDI Robot System is such an application in academic domain. This research is concerned with a structure-based gleaning subsystem for CINDI. The system separates theses, technical reports, academic papers, and FAQs as resources while e-mails, letters, resumes, graphics, and discussion groups are considered as chaff. This system makes decisions based on weight, which is carefully assigned to each resource by matching its structure with predefined Document Type Definitions (DTDs). The DTDs for the typical structure for the specific document types are built based on some predefined profiles. The system also features conversion subsystem in Windows environment to unify document formats for CINDI. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",

      "abstract": "This study computationalizes two linguistic concepts, contrast and focus, and applies them to the robust understanding of spontaneous speech in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). We propose focus kernel to represent those words which contain novel and important information neither presupposed by the interlocutor nor contained in the precedent words of the utterance. We also define contrast as a set of words which are parallel in linguistic or information structure but different or contrastive in meaning. In particular, we define three types of contrast: symmetric contrast, contrastive focus, and contrastive topic . We further demonstrate the effectiveness of detecting contrast and focus kernel by evaluating the performance on the ITS corpus. The detection of contrast and focus kernel is based on word similarity and dissimilarity analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and pitch accent. The classification achieved accuracies of 83.8% for focus kernel and 85.2% for contrast. Moreover, we demonstrated the efficiency of focus kernel in content summarization of spoken messages: using accurate transcriptions of speech input, 75.5% tutoring events were correctly classified. In addition, we argue for the importance of detecting cognitive activities for robust speech understanding in the ITS dialogue scenario. In particular, we address and evaluate a cognitive state classification system, which classifies the cognitive activities of children users into three categories: confidence, puzzlement, and hesitation. The classification yielded accuracies of 96.6% for transcribed speech and 95.7% for recognized speech. The study results showed that the cognitive state classification was very robust to speech recognition errors. Moreover, this study tries to acknowledge the role of speech in SLU. The existing semantic analysis of speech is usually achieved through text transcription. However, human interpretation of speech and text is via different channels. We admit the role of text in semantic analysis, but we also investigate how to use the speech characteristics to semantically analyze the content meaning of speech signals.",

Based on the analysis, we also introduce a generalized family of Bayesian posteriors, and show that the convergence behavior of these generalized posteriors is completely determined by the local prior structure around the true distribution. This important and surprising robustness property does not hold for the standard Bayesian posterior in that it may not concentrate when there exist \"bad\" prior structures even at places far away from the true distribution.",

The proposed approach can be used to retrieve audio/video segments in studios, audiovisual libraries, and family entertainment applications. For example, video scenes of a gun fight can be retrieved by searching for sounds of shooting or explosion. In addition, it will have applications in surveillance by recognizing sounds related to criminal activities. An accuracy rate of 86% for sound effects classification is achieved with the proposed method. Also, a query-by-example retrieval approach for sound effects is proposed on top of the archiving scheme, which is proved to be highly efficient and effective.",

When no gazetteer or other additional training resources are used, the combined system attains a performance of 91.6F on the English development data; integrating name, location and person gazetteers, and named entity systems trained on additional, more general, data reduces the F-measure error by a factor of 15 to 21% on the English data.",

      "abstract": "Statistical machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to many natural language processing (NLP) problems. Compared to manually constructed systems, statistical NLP systems are often easier to develop and maintain since only annotated training text is required. From annotated data, the underlying statistical algorithm can build a model so that annotations for future data can be predicted. However, the performance of a statistical system can also depend heavily on the characteristics of the training data. If we apply such a system to text with characteristics different from that of the training data, then performance degradation will occur. In this paper, we examine this issue empirically using the sentence boundary detection problem. We propose and compare several methods that can be used to update a statistical NLP system when moving to a different domain.",

We present a regular hardware architecture to implement the reformulated Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which can achieve high throughput. Moreover, an operation scheduling scheme is proposed to further reduce the hardware complexity without loss of throughput.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a text chunking system based on a generalization of the Winnow algorithm. We propose a general statistical model for text chunking which we then convert into a classification problem. We argue that the Winnow family of algorithms is particularly suitable for solving classification problems arising from NLP applications, due to their robustness to irrelevant features. However in theory, Winnow may not converge for linearly non-separable data. To remedy this problem, we employ a generalization of the original Winnow method. An additional advantage of the new algorithm is that it provides reliable confidence estimates for its classification predictions. This property is required in our statistical modeling approach. We show that our system achieves state of the art performance in text chunking with less computational cost then previous systems.",

      "abstract": "Many machine learning methods have recently been applied to natural language processing tasks. Among them, the Winnow algorithm has been argued to be particularly suitable for NLP problems, due to its robustness to irrelevant features. However in theory, Winnow may not converge for non-separable data. To remedy this problem, a modification called regularized Winnow has been proposed. In this paper, we apply this new method to text chunking. We show that this method achieves state of the art performance with significantly less computation than previous approaches.",

For a linearly separable problem, it is known that under appropriate assumptions, the expected misclassification error of the computed &amp;quot;optimal hyperplane&amp;quot; approaches zero at a rate proportional to the inverse training sample size. This rate is usually characterized by the margin and the maximum norm of the input data. In this paper, we argue that another quantity, namely the robustness of the input data distribution, also plays an important role in characterizing the convergence behavior of expected misclassification error. Based on this concept of robustness, we show that for a large margin separable linear classification problem, the expected misclassification error may converge exponentially in the number of training sample size.",

      "abstract": "While previous research on audiovisual data segmentation and indexing primarily focuses on the pictorial part, significant clues contained in the accompanying audio flow are often ignored. A fully functional system for video content parsing can be achieved more successfully through a proper combination of audio and visual information. By investigating the data structure of different video types, we present tools for both audio and visual content analysis and a scheme for video segmentation and annotation in this research. In the proposed system, video data are segmented into audio scenes and visual shots by detecting abrupt changes in audio and visual features, respectively. Then, the audio scene is categorized and indexed as one of the basic audio types while a visual shot is presented by keyframes and associate image features. An index table is then generated automatically for each video clip based on the integration of outputs from audio and visual analysis. It is shown that the proposed system provides satisfying video indexing results.",
