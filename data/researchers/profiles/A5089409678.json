      "abstract": "Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\\% in accuracy and 1.26\\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.",

      "abstract": "Transformer-based approaches have shown promising performance in image restoration tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies, which are essential for recovering clear images. Although various efficient attention mechanisms have been proposed to address the intensive computational loads of transformers, they often suffer from redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions, as they consider all available tokens. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST-v2) to mitigate these issues by reducing noisy interactions in irrelevant areas and removing feature redundancy along channel dimension. AST-v2 incorporates two core components: an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). ASSA adopts a dual-branch design, where the sparse branch guides the modulation of standard dense attention weights. This paradigm reduces the negative impact of irrelevant token interactions while preserving the important ones. Meanwhile, FRFN utilizes an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy across channels, enhancing the restoration of clear images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks show the competitive performance of our method for 6 restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, haze removal, shadow removal, snow removal, blur removal, and low-light enhancement. The code is available in the supplementary materials.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in https://zzcheng.top/MODA.",

      "abstract": "Effectively leveraging motion information is crucial for the image deblurring task. Existing methods typically build deep-learning models to restore a clean image by estimating blur patterns over the entire movement. This suggests that the blur caused by rotational motion components is processed together with the translational one. Exploring the movement without separation leads to limited performance for complex motion deblurring, especially rotational motion. In this paper, we propose Motion Decomposition Transformer (MDT), a transformer-based architecture augmented with polarized modules for deblurring via motion vector decomposition. MDT consists of a Motion Decomposition Module (MDM) for extracting hybrid rotation and translation features and a Radial Stripe Attention Solver (RSAS) for sharp image reconstruction with enhanced rotational information. Specifically, the MDM uses a deformable Cartesian convolutional branch to capture translational motion, complemented by a polar-system branch to capture rotational motion. The RSAS employs radial stripe windows and angular relative positional encoding in the polar system to enhance rotational information. This design preserves translational details while keeping computational costs lower than dual-coordinate design. Experimental results on 6 image deblurring datasets show that MDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling blur caused by complex motions with significant rotational components. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Calvin11311/MDT.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, significant efforts have been dedicated to designing efficient models for the challenge of ultra-high resolution (UHR) semantic segmentation. These models mainly follow the dual-stream architecture and generally fall into three subcategories according to the improvement objectives, i.e., dual-stream ensemble, selective zoom, and complementary learning. However, most of them overly concentrate on crafting complex pipelines to pursue one of the above objectives separately, limiting the model performance in both accuracy and inference consumption. In this paper, we suggest simultaneously achieving these objectives by estimating resolution-biased uncertainties in low resolution stream. Here, the resolution-biased uncertainty refers to the degree of prediction unreliability primarily caused by resolution loss from down-sampling operations. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream UHR segmentation framework, where an estimator is used to assess resolution-biased uncertainties through the entropy map and high-frequency feature residual. The framework also includes a selector, an ensembler, and a complementer to boost the model with obtained estimations. They share the uncertainty estimations as the weights to choose difficult regions as the inputs for UHR stream, perform weighted fusion between distinct streams, and enhance the learning for important pixels, respectively. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves a satisfactory balance between accuracy and inference consumption against other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, many notable methods have emerged to tackle the computational resource challenge of the high resolution image recognition (HRIR). They typically focus on identifying and aggregating a few salient regions for classification, discarding sub-salient areas for low training consumption. Nevertheless, many HRIR tasks necessitate the exploration of wider regions to model objects and contexts, which limits their performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we present a DBPS strategy to enable training with more patches at low consumption. Specifically, in addition to a fundamental buffer that stores the embeddings of most salient patches, DBPS further employs an auxiliary buffer to recycle those sub-salient ones. To reduce the computational cost associated with gradients of sub-salient patches, these patches are primarily used in the forward pass to provide sufficient information for classification. Meanwhile, only the gradients of the salient patches are back-propagated to update the entire network. Moreover, we design a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) architecture that leverages aggregated information from salient patches to filter out uninformative background within sub-salient patches for better accuracy. Besides, we introduce the random patch drop to accelerate training process and uncover informative regions. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of both accuracy and training consumption against other advanced methods.

      "abstract": "Diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale paired image-text data achieve significant success in image editing. To convey more fine-grained visual details, subject-driven editing integrates subjects in user-provided reference images into existing scenes. However, it is challenging to obtain photorealistic results, which simulate contextual interactions, such as reflections, illumination, and shadows, induced by merging the target object into the source image. To address this issue, we propose PS-Diffusion, which ensures realistic and consistent object-scene blending while maintaining the invariance of subject appearance during editing. To be specific, we first divide the contextual interactions into those occurring in the foreground and the background areas. The effect of the former is estimated through intrinsic image decomposition, and the region of the latter is predicted in an additional background effect control branch. Moreover, we propose an effect attention module to disentangle the learning processes of interaction and subject, alleviating confusion between them. Additionally, we introduce a synthesized dataset, Replace-5K, consisting of 5,000 image pairs with invariant subject and contextual interactions via 3D rendering. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on our dataset and two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available in the https://github.com/wei-cheng777/PS-Diffusion.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis has attracted extensive research attention as increasing numbers of users share images and texts to express their emotions and opinions on social media. Collecting large amounts of labeled sentiment data is an expensive and challenging task due to the high cost of labeling and unavoidable label ambiguity. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is explored to utilize the extensive unlabeled data to alleviate the demand for annotation. However, unlike typical multimodal tasks, sentiment inconsistency between image and text degrades the performance of SSL algorithms. To address the issue, we propose SCRD, the first semi-supervised framework for image-text sentiment recognition. To better utilize the discriminative features of each modality, we decouple features into common and private parts. We then use the private features to train unimodal classifiers for enhanced modality-specific sentiment representation. Considering the complex relationships between modalities, we devise a modal selection-based attention module that adaptively identifies the dominant sentiment modality at the sample level to guide multimodal fusion. Furthermore, to prevent model predictions from over-relying on common features under the guidance of multimodal labels, we design a pseudo-label filtering strategy based on the matching degree of prediction and dominant modality. Extensive experiments and comparisons on five publicly available datasets demonstrate that SCRD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/wuyou-xia/Seek-Common-Ground-While-Reserving-Differences.",

It is time to pay attention to more complex vision tasks, as model size, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities continue to improve. In this paper, we introduce and review a family of complex tasks, termed Concealed Dense Prediction (CDP), which has great value in agriculture, industry, etc. CDP's intrinsic trait is that the targets are concealed in their surroundings, thus fully perceiving them requires fine-grained representations, prior knowledge, auxiliary reasoning, etc. The contributions of this review are three-fold: (i) We introduce the scope, characteristics, and challenges specific to CDP tasks and emphasize their essential differences from generic vision tasks. (ii) We develop a taxonomy based on concealment counteracting to summarize deep learning efforts in CDP through experiments on three tasks. We compare 25 state-of-the-art methods across 12 widely used concealed datasets. (iii) We discuss the potential applications of CDP in the large model era and summarize 6 potential research directions. We offer perspectives for the future development of CDP by constructing a large-scale multimodal instruction fine-tuning dataset, CvpINST, and a concealed visual perception agent, CvpAgent.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates for the first time the non-stationary stochastic lot-sizing problem involving multi-dealer joint replenishment under the policy (R, S) without fill rate constraints. The planning horizon for each dealer is divided into the replenishment cycle series, accounting for the lead time associated with each joint replenishment cycle. A shortest path model is developed. Through mathematical analysis, the safety stock variables are eliminated, and the multiple variables are reduced to replenishment variables only. The stochastic problem is converted to the deterministic dynamic lot-sizing through expectation analysis. Furthermore, the MLS-MRS heuristic is proposed based on Robinson's Left-Right shift (LS-RS) heuristic by adding a module, the positive cost-saving family shifts. This algorithm improves the optimal solution and notably greatly increases the search speed.",

      "abstract": "Recently, sentiment analysis research has made significant improvements in addressing sentiment and subjectivity within textual content. The advent of multimodal deep learning techniques has further broadened this scope, enabling the integration of diverse modalities such as voice and image features alongside text. However, despite these advancements, the analysis of the Korean language remains challenging due to its inherently agglutinative nature and linguistic ambiguity, primarily examined at the sentence level. To effectively address this challenge, we propose a novel Multimodal Sentimental Deep Learning Framework for Korean (MSDLF-K), which can examine not only Korean text but also its associated speech. Our framework, MSDLF-K, integrates spectrograms and waveforms from Korean voice data with embedding vectors derived from script sentences, creating a unified multimodal representation. This approach facilitates the identification of both shared and unique features within the latent space, thereby offering valuable insights into their respective impacts on sentiment analysis performance. To validate the efficacy of MSDLF-K, we conducted a set of experiments using the emotion speech synthesis dataset. Our findings demonstrate that MSDLF-K achieves a remarkable accuracy of 79.0% in valence and 81.7% in arousal for emotion classification, metrics previously unexplored in the literature. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals the significant influence of multimodal representations, encompassing both text and voice, on enhancing emotion analysis performance. In summary, our study not only presents a pioneering solution for sentiment analysis in the Korean language but also underscores the importance of incorporating multimodal approaches for more comprehensive and accurate sentiment analysis across diverse linguistic contexts.",

      "abstract": "In online chatting, people increasingly prefer using stickers to supplement or replace text for replies, as sticker images can express vivid and varied emotions. The Sticker Response Selection (SRS) task aims to predict the sticker image that is most relevant to the history dialogue. Previous researches explore the semantic similarity between context and stickers, overlooking both unimodal and cross-modal emotional information. In this paper, we propose a 'Perceive before Respond' (PBR) training paradigm. PBR perceives sticker emotions through a knowledge distillation module. Variety representations of each emotion category are acquired from the large-scale sticker emotion recognition dataset and distilled into our model to enhance emotion comprehension. We further distinguish stickers with similar subject elements under the same topic. We perform contrastive learning at both inter- and intra-topic levels to obtain discriminative and diverse sticker representations. In addition, we improve the hard negative sampling method for image-text matching based on cross-modal sentiment association, conducting hard sample mining from both semantic similarity and sentiment polarity similarity for sticker-to-dialogue and dialogue-to-sticker. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of each proposed component. Ablation experiments on different backbone networks demonstrate the generality of our approach. Our code is released on https://github.com/wuyou-xia/Perceive-before-Respond.",

      "abstract": "Correspondence pruning plays a crucial role in a variety of feature matching based tasks, which aims at identifying correct correspondences (inliers) from initial ones. Seeking consistent k-nearest neighbors in both coordinate and feature spaces is a prevalent strategy employed in previous approaches. However, the vicinity of an inlier contains numerous irregular false correspondences (outliers), which leads them to mistakenly become neighbors according to the similarity constraint of nearest neighbors. To tackle this issue, we propose a global-graph space to seek consistent neighbors with similar graph structures. This is achieved by using a global connected graph to explicitly render the affinity relationship between correspondences based on the spatial and feature consistency. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of method for various matching scenes, we develop a neighbor consistency block to adequately leverage the potential of three types of neighbors. The consistency can be progressively mined by sequentially extracting intra-neighbor context and exploring inter-neighbor interactions. Ultimately, we present a Neighbor Consistency Mining Network (NCMNet) to estimate the parametric models and remove outliers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks for two-view geometry estimation. Meanwhile, four extended tasks, including remote sensing image registration, point cloud registration, 3D reconstruction, and visual localization, are conducted to test the generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Image emotion analysis has gained notable attention owing to the growing importance of computationally modeling human emotions. Most previous studies have focused on classifying the feelings evoked by an image into predefined emotion categories. Compared with these categorical approaches which cannot address the ambiguity and complexity of human emotions, recent studies have taken dimensional approaches to address these problems. However, there is still a limitation in that the number of dimensional datasets is significantly smaller for model training, compared with many available categorical datasets. We propose four types of frameworks that use categorical datasets to predict emotion values for a given image in the valence–arousal (VA) space. Specifically, our proposed framework is trained to predict continuous emotion values under the supervision of categorical labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach showed a positive correlation with the actual VA values of the dimensional dataset. In addition, our framework improves further when a small number of dimensional datasets are available for the fine-tuning process.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we leverage image complexity as a prior for refining segmentation features to achieve accurate real-time semantic segmentation. The design philosophy is based on the observation that different pixel regions within an image exhibit varying levels of complexity, with higher complexities posing a greater challenge for accurate segmentation. We thus introduce image complexity as prior guidance and propose the Image Complexity prior-guided Feature Refinement Network (ICFRNet). This network aggregates both complexity and segmentation features to produce an attention map for refining segmentation features within an Image Complexity Guided Attention (ICGA) module. We optimize the network in terms of both segmentation and image complexity prediction tasks with a combined loss function. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and CamViD datasets have shown that our ICFRNet achieves higher accuracy with a competitive efficiency for real-time segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Camouflaged vision perception is an important vision task with numerous practical applications. Due to the expensive collection and labeling costs, this community struggles with a major bottleneck that the species category of its datasets is limited to a small number of object species. However, the existing camouflaged generation methods require specifying the background manually, thus failing to extend the camouflaged sample diversity in a low-cost manner. In this paper, we propose a Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion (LAKE-RED) for camouflaged image generation. To our knowledge, our contributions mainly include: (1) For the first time, we propose a camouflaged generation paradigm that does not need to re-eive any background inputs. (2) Our LAKE-RED is the first knowledge retrieval-augmented method with interpretability for camouflaged generation, in which we propose an idea that knowledge retrieval and reasoning enhancement are separated explicitly, to alleviate the task-specific chal-lenges. Moreover, our method is not restricted to specific foreground targets or backgrounds, offering a potential for extending camouflaged vision perception to more diverse domains. (3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing approaches, generating more realistic camouflage images.

      "abstract": "Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks, given their ability to model long-range dependencies, which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers, they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs, i.e., an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically, ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm, where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features, while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile, FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels, enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks, including rain streak removal, real haze removal, and raindrop removal. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/joshyZhou/AST.",

      "abstract": "Video prediction is a challenging task due to its nature of uncertainty, especially for forecasting a long pe-riod. To model the temporal dynamics, advanced methods benefit from the recent success of diffusion models, and repeatedly refine the predicted future frames with 3D spatiotemporal U-Net. However, there exists a gap between the present and future and the repeated usage of U-Net brings a heavy computation burden. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based video prediction method that predicts future frames by extrapolating the present distribution of features, namely ExtDM. Specifically, our method consists of three components: (i) a motion autoencoder conducts a bijection transformation between video frames and motion cues; (ii) a layered distribution adaptor module extrapolates the present features in the guidance of Gaussian distribution; (iii) a 3D U-Net architecture specialized for jointly fusing guidance and features among the temporal dimension by spatiotemporal-window attention. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks covering short- and long-term video prediction verify the effectiveness of ExtDM.",

      "abstract": "Limited training data is a long-standing problem for video emotion analysis (VEA). Existing works leverage the power of large-scale image datasets for transferring while failing to extract the temporal correlation of affective cues in the video. Inspired by psychology research and empirical theory, we verify that the degree of emotion may vary in different segments of the video, thus introducing the sen-timent complementary and emotion intrinsic among temporal segments. We propose an MAE-style method for learning robust affective representation of videos via masking, termed MART. First, we extract the affective cues of the lexicon and verify the extracted one by computing its matching score with video content, in terms of sentiment and emotion scores alongside the temporal dimension. Then, with the verified cues, we propose masked affective modeling to re-cover temporal emotion distribution. We present temporal affective complementary learning that pulls the complementary part and pushes the intrinsic one of masked multimodal features, where the constraint is set with cross-modal attention among features to mask the video and recover the degree of emotion among segments. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show the superiority of our method in video sentiment analysis, video emotion recognition, multimodal sentiment analysis, and multimodal emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Intense light sources often produce flares in captured images at night, which deteriorates the visual quality and negatively affects downstream applications. In order to train an effective flare removal network, a reliable dataset is essential. The mainstream flare removal datasets are semi-synthetic to reduce human labour, but these datasets do not cover typical scenarios involving multiple scattering flares. To tackle this issue, we synthesize a prior-guided dataset named Flare7K*, which contains multi-flare images where the brightness of flares adheres to the laws of illumination. Besides, flares tend to occupy localized regions of the image but existing networks perform flare removal on the entire image and sometimes modify clean areas incorrectly. Therefore, we propose a plug-and-play Adaptive Focus Module (AFM) that can adaptively mask the clean background areas and assist models in focusing on the regions severely affected by flares. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our data synthesis method can better simulate real-world scenes and several models equipped with AFM achieve state-of-the-art performance on the real-world test dataset.",

      "abstract": "Exploring motion information is important for the motion deblurring task. Recent the window-based transformer approaches have achieved decent performance in image deblurring. Note that the motion causing blurry results is usually composed of translation and rotation movements and the window-shift operation in the Cartesian coordinate system by the window-based transformer approaches only directly explores translation motion in orthogonal directions. Thus, these methods have the limitation of modeling the rotation part. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the polar coordinate-based transformer, which has the angles and distance to explore rotation motion and translation information together. In this paper, we propose a Radial Strip Transformer (RST), which is a transformer-based architecture that restores the blur images in a polar coordinate system instead of a Cartesian one. RST contains a dynamic radial embedding module (DRE) to extract the shallow feature by a radial deformable convolution. We design a polar mask layer to generate the offsets for the deformable convolution, which can reshape the convolution kernel along the radius to better capture the rotation motion information. Furthermore, we proposed a radial strip attention solver (RSAS) as deep feature extraction, where the relationship of windows is organized by azimuth and radius. This attention module contains radial strip windows to reweight image features in the polar coordinate, which preserves more useful information in rotation and translation motion together for better recovering the sharp images. Experimental results on six synthesis and real-world datasets prove that our method performs favorably against other SOTA methods for the image deblurring task.",

      "abstract": "Emotions can be perceived from a person's gait, i.e., their walking style. Existing methods on gait emotion recognition mainly leverage the posture information as input, but ignore the body movement, which contains complementary information for recognizing emotions evoked in the gait. In this paper, we propose a Bilateral Posture and Movement Graph Convolutional Network (BPM-GCN) that consists of two parallel streams, namely posture stream and movement stream, to recognize emotions from two views. The posture stream aims to explicitly analyse the emotional state of the person. Specifically, we design a novel regression constraint based on the hand-engineered features to distill the prior affective knowledge into the network and boost the representation learning. The movement stream is designed to describe the intensity of the emotion, which is an implicitly cue for recognizing emotions. To achieve this goal, we employ a higher-order velocity-acceleration pair to construct graphs, in which the informative movement features are utilized. Besides, we design a PM-Interacted feature fusion mechanism to adaptively integrate the features from the two streams. Therefore, the two streams collaboratively contribute to the performance from two complementary views. Extensive experiments on the largest benchmark dataset Emotion-Gait show that BPM-GCN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches (with at least 4.59% performance improvement). The source code is released on https://github.com/exped1230/BPM-GCN .",

      "abstract": "Travelling is an activity for relaxation and self-recovery. A picture showing a place with positive emotion, e.g. amusement or contentment, holds higher power than one with negative emotion. In the era of social media, how people emotionally perceive the visual content of shared photographs was rarely interpreted. In this study, we innovatively applied two deep learning models in computer vision for the visual content and sentiment analysis of 39, 117 tourists’ photographs taken in Beijing. As a result, we discovered the specific correlation between the main publisher's cognitive concepts and the eight viewer affective concepts of tourists’ photographs. Practically, we established an approach for DMOs to select a positive picture with fit content for a destination. Theoretically, this study extends the role of user-generated photographs for generating the destination image.",

      "abstract": "Label distribution learning (LDL) is a recent hot topic, in which ambiguity is modeled via description degrees of the labels. However, in common LDL tasks, e.g., age estimation, labels are in an intrinsic order. The conventional LDL paradigm adopts a per-label manner for optimization, neglecting the internal sequential patterns of labels. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm, termed ordinal label distribution learning (OLDL). We model the sequential patterns of labels from aspects of spatial, semantic, and temporal order relationships. The spatial order depicts the relative position between arbitrary labels. We build cross-label transformation between distributions, which is determined by the spatial margin in labels. Labels naturally yield different semantics, so the semantic order is represented by constructing semantic correlations between arbitrary labels. The temporal order describes that the presence of labels is determined by their order, i.e. five after four. The value of a particular label contains information about previous labels, and we adopt cumulative distribution to construct this relationship. Based on these characteristics of ordinal labels, we propose the learning objectives and evaluation metrics for OLDL, namely CAD, QFD, and CJS. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four tasks demonstrate the superiority of OLDL against other existing LDL methods in both traditional and newly proposed metrics.

      "abstract": "Tracking both location and pose of multiple planar objects (MPOT) is of great significance to numerous real-world applications. The greater degree-of-freedom of planar objects compared with common objects makes MPOT far more challenging than well-studied object tracking, especially when occlusion occurs. To address this challenging task, we are inspired by amodal perception that humans jointly track visible and invisible parts of the target, and propose a tracking framework that unifies appearance perception and occlusion reasoning. Specifically, we present a dual-branch network to track the visible part of planar objects, including vertexes and mask. Then, we develop an occlusion area localization strategy to infer the invisible part, i.e., the occluded region, followed by a two-stream attention network finally refining the prediction. To alleviate the lack of data in this field, we build the first large-scale benchmark dataset, namely MPOT-3K. It consists of 3,717 planar objects from 356 videos and contains 148,896 frames together with 687,417 annotations. The collected planar objects have 9 motion patterns and the videos are shot in 6 types of indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on the newly developed MPOT-3K as well as other two popular single planar object tracking datasets. The code and MPOT-3K dataset are released on https://zzcheng.top/MPOT.",

      "abstract": "Emotion and sentiment play a central role in various human activities, such as perception, decision-making, social interaction, and logical reasoning. Developing artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) for machines is becoming a bottleneck in human–computer interaction. The first step of AEI is to recognize the emotion and sentiment that are conveyed in different affective signals. Traditional supervised emotion and sentiment analysis (ESA) methods, especially deep learning-based ones, usually require large-scale labeled training data. However, due to the essential subjectivity, complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity, and subtlety, collecting such annotations is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult in practice. In this article, we introduce label-efficient ESA from the computational perspective. First, we present a hierarchical taxonomy for label-efficient learning based on the availability of sample labels, emotion categories, and data domains during training. Second, for each of the seven paradigms, i.e., unsupervised, semisupervised, weakly supervised, low-shot, incremental, domain-adaptive, and domain-generalizable ESA, we give the definition, summarize existing methods, and present our views on the quantitative and qualitative comparison. Finally, we provide several promising real-world applications, followed by unsolved challenges and potential future directions.",

      "abstract": "Sarcasm indicates the literal meaning is contrary to the real attitude. Considering the popularity and complementarity of image-text data, we investigate the task of multi-modal sarcasm detection. Different from other multi-modal tasks, for the sarcastic data, there exists intrinsic incongruity between a pair of image and text as demonstrated in psychological theories. To tackle this issue, we propose a Dual Incongruity Perceiving (DIP) network consisting of two branches to mine the sarcastic information from factual and affective levels. For the factual aspect, we introduce a channel-wise reweighting strategy to obtain semantically discriminative embeddings, and leverage gaussian distribution to model the uncertain correlation caused by the incongruity. The distribution is generated from the latest data stored in the memory bank, which can adaptively model the difference of semantic similarity between sarcastic and non-sarcastic data. For the affective aspect, we utilize siamese layers with shared parameters to learn cross-modal sentiment information. Furthermore, we use the polarity value to construct a relation graph for the mini-batch, which forms the continuous contrastive loss to acquire affective embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is released on https://github.com/downdric/MSD.",

      "abstract": "The goal of correspondence pruning is to recognize correct correspondences (inliers) from initial ones, with applications to various feature matching based tasks. Seeking neighbors in the coordinate and feature spaces is a common strategy in many previous methods. However, it is difficult to ensure that these neighbors are always consistent, since the distribution of false correspondences is extremely irregular. For addressing this problem, we propose a novel global-graph space to search for consistent neighbors based on a weighted global graph that can explicitly explore long-range dependencies among correspondences. On top of that, we progressively construct three neighbor embeddings according to different neighbor search spaces, and design a Neighbor Consistency block to extract neighbor context and explore their interactions sequentially. In the end, we develop a Neighbor Consistency Mining Network (NCMNet) for accurately recovering camera poses and identifying inliers. Experimental results indicate that our NCMNet achieves a significant performance advantage over state-of-the-art competitors on challenging outdoor and indoor matching scenes. The source code can be found at https://github.com/xinliu29/NCMNet.",

      "abstract": "Automatically predicting the emotions of user-generated videos (UGVs) receives increasing interest recently. However, existing methods mainly focus on a few key visual frames, which may limit their capacity to encode the context that depicts the intended emotions. To tackle that, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal temporal erasing network that locates not only keyframes but also context and audio-related information in a weakly-supervised manner. In specific, we first leverage the intra- and inter-modal relationship among different segments to accurately select keyframes. Then, we iteratively erase keyframes to encourage the model to concentrate on the contexts that include complementary information. Extensive experiments on three challenging video emotion benchmarks demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released on https://github.com/nku-zhichengzhang/WECL.",

      "abstract": "Pre-training of deep convolutional neural networks (DC-NNs) plays a crucial role in the field of visual sentiment analysis (VSA). Most proposed methods employ the off-the-shelf backbones pre-trained on large-scale object classification datasets (i.e., ImageNet). While it boosts performance for a big margin against initializing model states from random, we argue that DCNNs simply pre-trained on ImageNet may excessively focus on recognizing objects, but failed to provide high-level concepts in terms of sentiment. To address this long-term overlooked problem, we propose a sentiment-oriented pre-training method that is built upon human visual sentiment perception (VSP) mechanism. Specifically, we factorize the process of VSP into three steps, namely stimuli taking, holistic organizing, and high-level perceiving. From imitating each VSP step, a total of three models are separately pre-trained via our devised sentiment-aware tasks that contribute to excavating sentiment-discriminated representations. Moreover, along with our elaborated multi-model amalgamation strategy, the prior knowledge learned from each perception step can be effectively transferred into a single target model, yielding substantial performance gains. Finally, we verify the superiorities of our proposed method over extensive experiments, covering mainstream VSA tasks from single-label learning (SLL), multi-label learning (MLL), to label distribution learning (LDL). Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method leads to unanimous improvements in these downstream tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/tinglyfeng/sentiment_pretraining.",

      "abstract": "Existing methods in planar region segmentation suffer the problems of vague boundaries and failure to detect small-sized regions. To address these, this study presents an end-to-end framework, named PlaneSeg, which can be easily integrated into various plane segmentation models. Specifically, PlaneSeg contains three modules, namely, the edge feature extraction module, the multiscale module, and the resolution-adaptation module. First, the edge feature extraction module produces edge-aware feature maps for finer segmentation boundaries. The learned edge information acts as a constraint to mitigate inaccurate boundaries. Second, the multiscale module combines feature maps of different layers to harvest spatial and semantic information from planar objects. The multiformity of object information can help recognize small-sized objects to produce more accurate segmentation results. Third, the resolution-adaptation module fuses the feature maps produced by the two aforementioned modules. For this module, a pairwise feature fusion is adopted to resample the dropped pixels and extract more detailed features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PlaneSeg outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on three downstream tasks, including plane segmentation, 3-D plane reconstruction, and depth prediction. Code is available at https://github.com/nku-zhichengzhang/PlaneSeg.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, people are accustomed to posting images and associated text for expressing their emotions on social networks. Accordingly, multimodal sentiment analysis has drawn increasingly more attention. Most of the existing image-text multimodal sentiment analysis methods simply predict the sentiment polarity. However, the same sentiment polarity may correspond to quite different emotions, such as happiness vs. excitement and disgust vs. sadness. Therefore, sentiment polarity is ambiguous and may not convey the accurate emotions that people want to express. Psychological research has shown that objects and words are emotional stimuli and that semantic concepts can affect the role of stimuli. Inspired by this observation, this paper presents a new MUlti-Level SEmantic Reasoning network (MULSER) for fine-grained image-text multimodal emotion classification, which not only investigates the semantic relationship among objects and words respectively, but also explores the semantic relationship between regional objects and global concepts. For image modality, we first build graphs to extract objects and global representation, and employ a graph attention module to perform bilevel semantic reasoning. Then, a joint visual graph is built to learn the regional-global semantic relations. For text modality, we build a word graph and further apply graph attention to reinforce the interdependencies among words in a sentence. Finally, a cross-modal attention fusion module is proposed to fuse semantic-enhanced visual and textual features, based on which informative multimodal representations are obtained for fine-grained emotion classification. The experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in the real-world applications. However, large-scale FER datasets collected in the wild usually contain noises. More importantly, due to the ambiguity of emotion, facial images with multiple emotions are hard to be distinguished from the ones with noisy labels. Therefore, it is challenging to train a robust model for FER. To address this, we propose Emotion Ambiguity-SEnsitive cooperative networks (EASE) which contain two components. First, the ambiguity-sensitive learning module divides the training samples into three groups. The samples with small-losses in both networks are considered as clean samples, and the ones with large-losses are noisy. Note for the conflict samples that one network disagrees with the other, we distinguish the samples conveying ambiguous emotions from the ones with noises, using the polarity cues of emotions. Here, we utilize KL divergence to optimize the networks, enabling them to pay attention to the non-dominant emotions. The second part of EASE aims to enhance the diversity of the cooperative networks. With the training epochs increasing, the cooperative networks would converge to a consensus. We construct a penalty term according to the correlation between the features, which helps the networks learn diverse representations from the images. Extensive experiments on 6 popular facial expression datasets demonstrate that EASE outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Video sentiment analysis aims to uncover the underlying attitudes of viewers, which has a wide range of applications in real world. Existing works simply classify a video into a single sentimental category, ignoring the fact that sentiment in untrimmed videos may appear in multiple segments with varying lengths and unknown locations. To address this, we propose a challenging task, i.e., Temporal Sentiment Localization (TSL), to find which parts of the video convey sentiment. To systematically investigate fully- and weakly-supervised settings for TSL, we first build a benchmark dataset named TSL-300, which is consisting of 300 videos with a total length of 1,291 minutes. Each video is labeled in two ways, one of which is frame-by-frame annotation for the fully-supervised setting, and the other is single-frame annotation, i.e., only a single frame with strong sentiment is labeled per segment for the weakly-supervised setting. Due to the high cost of labeling a densely annotated dataset, we propose TSL-Net in this work, employing single-frame supervision to localize sentiment in videos. In detail, we generate the pseudo labels for unlabeled frames using a greedy search strategy, and fuse the affective features of both visual and audio modalities to predict the temporal sentiment distribution. Here, a reverse mapping strategy is designed for feature fusion, and a contrastive loss is utilized to maintain the consistency between the original feature and the reverse prediction. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method against the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "With the popularity of instant messaging applications, online chatting plays an essential role in our daily life. The prevailing use of stickers to express emotions in online chatting leads to the necessity of multimodal sticker emotion recognition. Considering the lack of sticker emotion data, we collect a large-scale sticker emotion recognition dataset named SER30K. It consists of a total of 1,887 sticker themes with total 30,739 sticker images. Some commonly used images, such as realistic images and facial expression images, have been well studied in the field of emotion analysis. However, it is still challenging to understand the emotion of sticker images. Since the characteristics in stickers from the same theme are similar, we can only accurately predict the emotion by capturing the local information (e.g., expressions, poses) and understanding the global information (e.g., relations among objects). To tackle this challenge, we propose a LOcal Re-Attention multimodal network (LORA) to learn sticker emotions in an end-to-end manner. Different from previous approaches using convolutional neural networks, LORA employs the vision transformer to extract visual features, leading to better capture the global relations. In addition, we design a local re-attention module to focus on important region information. Then a simple but efficient modal fusion module combines visual and language features. Extensive experiments are performed on the SER30K and other emotion recognition datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code, model and dataset are released on https://github.com/nku-shengzheliu/SER30K.",

      "abstract": "Background: Diesel exhaust is an established human carcinogen, however the mechanisms by which it leads to cancer development are not fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established contributor to carcinogenesis, and recent studies have improved our understanding of the role played by epigenetic modifications in the mitochondrial genome on tumorigenesis. In light of these developments, we aim to evaluate the association between diesel engine exhaust (DEE) exposure with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation levels in workers exposed to DEE. Methods: The study population consisted of 53 male workers employed at a diesel engine manufacturing facility in Northern China who were routinely exposed to diesel exhaust in their occupational setting, as well as 55 unexposed male control workers from other unrelated factories in the same geographic area. Exposure to DEE, elemental carbon as a DEE surrogate, organic carbon, and particulate matter (PM2.5) were assessed. mtDNA methylation for CpG sites (CpGs) from seven mitochondrial genes (D-Loop, MT-RNR1, MT-CO2, MT-CO3, MT-ATP6, MT-ATP8, MT-ND5) was measured in blood samples. Linear regression models were used to estimate the associations between DEE and mtDNA methylation levels, adjusting for potential confounders. The associations between elemental carbon, organic carbon, and PM2.5 exposures with mtDNA methylation levels were also assessed. Results: DEE exposure was associated with decreased MT-ATP6 (difference = -35.6%, p-value = 0.019) and MT-ATP8 methylation (difference = -30%, p-value = 0.029) compared to unexposed controls. Exposures to elemental carbon, organic carbon, and PM2.5 were also significantly and inversely associated with methylation in MT-ATP6 and MT-ATP8 genes (all p-values < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that DEE exposure perturbs mtDNA methylation, which may be of importance for tumorigenesis. Keywords: Diesel exhaust, mitochondrial DNA methylation",

      "abstract": "Due to facial images usually evoking multiple emotions with different intensities, there exists much ambiguity in facial expression recognition (FER). Previous methods jointly optimize multi-label learning (MLL) and label distribution learning (LDL) to suppress ambiguity, which have achieved excellent performance. However, the different convergence speed of MLL and LDL make the model easily over-fitting. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic distribution supervision (D <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> S) method, where the label distribution information is introduced as auxiliary supervision for multilabel classification. Specifically, we develop a multi-task framework in which MLL and LDL are optimized simultaneously. The losses are dynamically weighted to overcome the inconsistency of inter-losses optimization between the two tasks. Extensive experiments on the largest benchmark dataset, i.e., RAF-ML, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "More and more users are getting used to posting images and text on social networks to share their emotions or opinions. Accordingly, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a research topic of increasing interest in recent years. Typically, there exist affective regions that evoke human sentiment in an image, which are usually manifested by corresponding words in peoples comments. Similarly, people also tend to portray the affective regions of an image when composing image descriptions. As a result, the relationship between image affective regions and the associated text is of great significance for multimodal sentiment analysis. However, most of the existing multimodal sentiment analysis approaches simply concatenate features from image and text, which could not fully explore the interaction between them, leading to suboptimal results. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new image-text interaction network (ITIN) to investigate the relationship between affective image regions and text for multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modal alignment module to capture region-word correspondence, based on which multimodal features are fused through an adaptive cross-modal gating module. Moreover, considering the complementary role of context information on sentiment analysis, we integrate the individual-modal contextual feature representations for achieving more reliable prediction. Extensive experimental results and comparisons on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Image complexity (IC) is an essential visual perception for human beings to understand an image. However, explicitly evaluating the IC is challenging, and has long been overlooked since, on the one hand, the evaluation of IC is relatively subjective due to its dependence on human perception, and on the other hand, the IC is semantic-dependent while real-world images are diverse. To facilitate the research of IC assessment in this deep learning era, we built the first, to our best knowledge, large-scale IC dataset with 9,600 well-annotated images. The images are of diverse areas such as abstract, paintings and real-world scenes, each of which is elaborately annotated by 17 human contributors. Powered by this high-quality dataset, we further provide a base model to predict the IC scores and estimate the complexity density maps in a weakly supervised way. The model is verified to be effective, and correlates well with human perception (with the Pearson correlation coefficient being 0.949). Last but not the least, we have empirically validated that the exploration of IC can provide auxiliary information and boost the performance of a wide range of computer vision tasks. The dataset and source code can be found at https://github.com/tinglyfeng/IC9600.",

      "abstract": "The success of deep convolutional networks (ConvNets) generally relies on a massive amount of well-labeled data, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to collect and annotate in many scenarios. To eliminate such limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) is recently proposed. Specifically, by solving a pre-designed proxy task, SSL is capable of capturing general-purpose features without requiring human supervision. Existing efforts focus obsessively on designing a particular proxy task but ignore the semanticity of samples that are advantageous to downstream tasks, resulting in the inherent limitation that the learned features are specific to the proxy task, namely the proxy task-specificity of features. In this work, to improve the generalizability of features learned by existing SSL methods, we present a novel self-supervised framework SSL++ to incorporate the proxy task-independent semanticity of samples into the representation learning process. Technically, SSL++ aims to leverage the complementarity, between the low-level generic features learned by a proxy task and the high-level semantic features newly learned by the generated semantic pseudo-labels, to mitigate the task-specificity and improve the generalizability of features. Extensive experiments show that SSL++ performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches on the established and latest SSL benchmarks.",

Especially for the classification and resource allocation of encrypted network traffic, the research of related technologies has become the main research direction of the development of network technology. The extensive application of deep learning provides a new idea for the study of traffic classification. Therefore, on the basis of understanding the current situation, the improved convolutional neural network is selected to conduct an in-depth discussion on traffic classification and resource allocation of encrypted networks based on deep learning. The performance of the system is verified from the perspective of practical application.",

While, however, deep neural networks still lack the ability of learning from less labeling, e.g., with limited exemplars or fast generalizing to new tasks. In order to address the current inefficiency of multimedia, there is pressing need to research methods to drastically reduce requirements for labeled training data. This workshop aims to provide a platform for discussing the challenges and corresponding innovative approaches in multimedia with less labeling. We hope more advanced technologies can be proposed or inspired, and also we invite several domain-specific experts for sharing their insights and research progress on the topic of MULL.",

      "abstract": "To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power. Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features, respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second, we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

      "abstract": "Images can convey rich semantics and induce various emotions in viewers. Recently, with the rapid advancement of emotional intelligence and the explosive growth of visual data, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to affective image content analysis (AICA). In this survey, we will comprehensively review the development of AICA in the recent two decades, especially focusing on the state-of-the-art methods with respect to three main challenges - the affective gap, perception subjectivity, and label noise and absence. We begin with an introduction to the key emotion representation models that have been widely employed in AICA and description of available datasets for performing evaluation with quantitative comparison of label noise and dataset bias. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches on (1) emotion feature extraction, including both handcrafted and deep features, (2) learning methods on dominant emotion recognition, personalized emotion prediction, emotion distribution learning, and learning from noisy data or few labels, and (3) AICA based applications. Finally, we discuss some challenges and promising research directions in the future, such as image content and context understanding, group emotion clustering, and viewer-image interaction.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis of user-generated reviews or comments on products and services in social networks can help enterprises to analyze the feedback from customers and take corresponding actions for improvement. To mitigate large-scale annotations on the target domain, domain adaptation (DA) provides an alternate solution by learning a transferable model from other labeled source domains. Existing multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) methods either fail to extract some discriminative features in the target domain that are related to sentiment, neglect the correlations of different sources and the distribution difference among different sub-domains even in the same source, or cannot reflect the varying optimal weighting during different training stages. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level MDA framework, named curriculum cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (C-CycleGAN), to address the above issues. Specifically, C-CycleGAN consists of three components: (1) pre-trained text encoder which encodes textual input from different domains into a continuous representation space, (2) intermediate domain generator with curriculum instance-level adaptation which bridges the gap across source and target domains, and (3) task classifier trained on the intermediate domain for final sentiment classification. C-CycleGAN transfers source samples at instance-level to an intermediate domain that is closer to the target domain with sentiment semantics preserved and without losing discriminative features. Further, our dynamic instance-level weighting mechanisms can assign the optimal weights to different source samples in each training stage. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and achieve substantial gains over state-of-the-art DA approaches.

Specifically, we perform a sentiment analysis on the posted Weibos about the passengers’ experience in civil aviation travel. Different travel events could influence passengers’ sentiment, e.g., flight delay may cause negative sentiment. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel multimodal event-aware network to analyze sentiment from Weibos that contain multiple modalities, i.e., text and images. We first extract features from each modality and, then, model the cross-modal associations to obtain more discriminative representations, based on which we simultaneously perceive the event and sentiment in a multitask framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to large-scale labeled training data, deep neural networks (DNNs) have obtained remarkable success in many vision and multimedia tasks. However, because of the presence of domain shift, the learned knowledge of the well-trained DNNs cannot be well generalized to new domains or datasets that have few labels. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) studies the problem of transferring models trained on one labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. In this article, we focus on UDA in visual emotion analysis for both emotion distribution learning and dominant emotion classification. Specifically, we design a novel end-to-end cycle-consistent adversarial model, called CycleEmotionGAN++. First, we generate an adapted domain to align the source and target domains on the pixel level by improving CycleGAN with a multiscale structured cycle-consistency loss. During the image translation, we propose a dynamic emotional semantic consistency loss to preserve the emotion labels of the source images. Second, we train a transferable task classifier on the adapted domain with feature-level alignment between the adapted and target domains. We conduct extensive UDA experiments on the Flickr-LDL and Twitter-LDL datasets for distribution learning and ArtPhoto and Flickr and Instagram datasets for emotion classification. The results demonstrate the significant improvements yielded by the proposed CycleEmotionGAN++ compared to state-of-the-art UDA approaches.",

While the existing models have achieved satisfactory performance by associating questions with key objects in images, the answers also contain rich information that can be used to describe the visual contents in images. In this paper, we propose a re-attention framework to utilize the information in answers for the VQA task. The framework first learns the initial attention weights for the objects by calculating the similarity of each word-object pair in the feature space. Then, the visual attention map is reconstructed by re-attending the objects in images based on the answer. Through keeping the initial visual attention map and the reconstructed one to be consistent, the learned visual attention map can be corrected by the answer information. Besides, we introduce a gate mechanism to automatically control the contribution of re-attention to model training based on the entropy of the learned initial visual attention maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the proposed model performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.",

When multi-level features meet multi-modal cues, the optimal feature aggregation and multi-modal learning strategy become a hot potato. In this paper, we leverage the inherent multi-modal and multi-level nature of RGB-D salient object detection to devise a novel cascaded refinement network. In particular, first, we propose to regroup the multi-level features into teacher and student features using a bifurcated backbone strategy (BBS). Second, we introduce a depth-enhanced module (DEM) to excavate informative depth cues from the channel and spatial views. Then, RGB and depth modalities are fused in a complementary way. Our architecture, named Bifurcated Backbone Strategy Network (BBS-Net), is simple, efficient, and backbone-independent. Extensive experiments show that BBS-Net significantly outperforms eighteen SOTA models on eight challenging datasets under five evaluation measures, demonstrating the superiority of our approach ($\\sim 4 \\%$ improvement in S-measure $vs.$ the top-ranked model: DMRA-iccv2019). In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the generalization ability of different RGB-D datasets and provide a powerful training set for future research.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is inherently subject to the requirement of a large amount of well-labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain manually. In order to broaden the reach of DL, leveraging free web data becomes an attractive strategy to alleviate the issue of data scarcity. However, directly utilizing collected web data to train a deep model is ineffective because of the mixed noisy data. To address such problems, we develop a novel bidirectional self-paced learning (BiSPL) framework which reduces the effect of noise by learning from web data in a meaningful order. Technically, the BiSPL framework consists of two essential steps. Relying on distances defined between web samples and labeled source samples, first, the web samples with short distances are sampled and combined to form a new training set. Second, based on the new training set, both easy and hard samples are initially employed to train deep models for higher stability, and hard samples are gradually dropped to reduce the noise as the training progresses. By iteratively alternating such steps, deep models converge to a better solution. We mainly focus on the fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks because their corresponding datasets are generally small and therefore face a more significant data scarcity problem. Experiments conducted on six public FGVC tasks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Especially, BiSPL suffices to achieve the highest stable performance when the scale of the well-labeled training set decreases dramatically.",

      "abstract": "With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of people are accustomed to expressing their feelings and emotions online using images and videos. An emotion-based image retrieval (EBIR) system is useful for obtaining visual contents with desired emotions from a massive repository. Existing EBIR methods mainly focus on modeling the global characteristics of visual content without considering the crucial role of informative regions of interest in conveying emotions. Further, they ignore the hierarchical relationships between coarse polarities and fine categories of emotions. In this paper, we design an attention-aware polarity-sensitive embedding (APSE) network to address these issues. First, we develop a hierarchical attention mechanism to automatically discover and model the informative regions of interest. Specifically, both polarity-and emotion-specific attended representations are aggregated for discriminative feature embedding. Second, we propose a generated emotion-pair (GEP) loss to simultaneously consider the inter-and intra-polarity relationships of the emotion labels. Moreover, we adaptively generate negative examples of different hard levels in the feature space guided by the attention module to further improve the performance of feature embedding. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed APSE method outperforms the state-of-the-art EBIR approaches by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "Both images and music can convey rich semantics and are widely used to induce specific emotions. Matching images and music with similar emotions might help to make emotion perceptions more vivid and stronger. Existing emotion-based image and music matching methods either employ limited categorical emotion states which cannot well reflect the complexity and subtlety of emotions, or train the matching model using an impractical multi-stage pipeline. In this paper, we study end-to-end matching between image and music based on emotions in the continuous valence-arousal (VA) space. First, we construct a large-scale dataset, termed Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet), with over 140K image-music pairs. Second, we propose cross-modal deep continuous metric learning (CDCML) to learn a shared latent embedding space which preserves the cross-modal similarity relationship in the continuous matching space. Finally, we refine the embedding space by further preserving the single-modal emotion relationship in the VA spaces of both images and music. The metric learning in the embedding space and task regression in the label space are jointly optimized for both cross-modal matching and single-modal VA prediction. The extensive experiments conducted on IMEMNet demonstrate the superiority of CDCML for emotion-based image and music matching as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "The prevailing use of both images and text to express opinions on the web leads to the need for multimodal sentiment recognition. Some commonly used social media data containing short text and few images, such as tweets and product reviews, have been well studied. However, it is still challenging to predict the readers' sentiment after reading online news articles, since news articles often have more complicated structures, e.g., longer text and more images. To address this problem, we propose a layout-driven multimodal attention network (LD-MAN) to recognize news sentiment in an end-to-end manner. Rather than modeling text and images individually, LD-MAN uses the layout of online news to align images with the corresponding text. Specifically, it exploits a set of distance-based coefficients to model the image locations and measure the contextual relationship between images and text. LD-MAN then learns the affective representations of the articles from the aligned text and images using a multimodal attention mechanism. Considering the lack of relevant datasets in this field, we collect two multimodal online news datasets, containing a total of 14,566 articles with 56,260 images and 251,202 words. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably compared with state-of-the-art approaches. We will release all the codes, models and datasets to the community.",

      "abstract": "An image is worth a thousand words. Many researchers have conducted extensive studies to understand visual emotions since an increasing number of users express emotions via images and videos online. However, most existing methods based on convolutional neural networks aim to retrieve and classify affective images in a discrete label space while ignoring both the hierarchical and complex nature of emotions. On the one hand, different from concrete and isolated object concepts ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g</i> ., cat and dog), a hierarchical relationship exists among emotions. On the other hand, most widely used deep methods depend on the representation from fully connected layers, which lacks the essential texture information for recognizing emotions. In this work, we address the above problems via adaptive deep metric learning. Specifically, we design an adaptive sentiment similarity loss, which is able to embed affective images considering the emotion polarity and adaptively adjust the margin between different image pairs. To effectively distinguish affective images, we further propose the sentiment vector that captures the texture information extracted from multiple convolutional layers. Finally, we develop a unified multi-task deep framework to simultaneously optimize both retrieval and classification goals. Extensive and thorough evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in user-generated videos plays an important role in human-centered computing. Existing methods mainly employ traditional two-stage shallow pipeline, i.e. extracting visual and/or audio features and training classifiers. In this paper, we propose to recognize video emotions in an end-to-end manner based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we develop a deep Visual-Audio Attention Network (VAANet), a novel architecture that integrates spatial, channel-wise, and temporal attentions into a visual 3D CNN and temporal attentions into an audio 2D CNN. Further, we design a special classification loss, i.e. polarity-consistent cross-entropy loss, based on the polarity-emotion hierarchy constraint to guide the attention generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging VideoEmotion-8 and Ekman-6 datasets demonstrate that the proposed VAANet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for video emotion recognition. Our source code is released at: https://github.com/maysonma/VAANet.",

      "abstract": "The study of imaging through scattering media especially 3D imaging is of great significance in many fields such as biomedical imaging. Recently, deep learning has been widely used in the field of information processing with its remarkable performance. In this paper, we proposed a method of three - dimensional imaging through scattering media based on deep learning. This method uses the deep neural network to process the information captured by the light field imaging system based on the microlens array, recovering the no-scattering 4D light field information, and then realize three-dimensional reconstruction by using the processed light field information. Deep learning method requires a large number of samples. But in many environments, it is difficult to obtain a large number of three-dimensional samples through experiment. To solve this crucial problem, we use incoherent light propagation model to simulate the light field propagation and generate samples which contains three-dimensional information through simulation. In this paper, we simulated the propagation of radiation emitted from objects behind a single layer of weak scattering media, generated a large number of samples of 4D light field information by simulation, trained the neural network and processed the test data set generated by simulation, and we realized the deblurring of the light field information which contains information of multiple layers of flat semitransparent objects, which could be used to realize the 3D reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "Visual sentiment analysis is attracting increasing attention with the rapidly growing amount of images uploaded to social networks. Learning rich visual representations often requires training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on massive manually labeled data, which is expensive or scarce especially for a subjective task like visual sentiment analysis. Meanwhile, a large quantity of social images is quite available yet noisy by querying social networks using the sentiment categories as keywords, where various types of images related to the specific sentiment can be easily collected. In this article, we propose a multiple kernel network for visual sentiment recognition, which learns representation from strongly- and weakly supervised CNNs. Specifically, the weakly supervised deep model is trained using the large-scale data from social images, whereas the strongly supervised deep model is fine tuned on the affecitve datasets with manual annotation. We employ the multiple kernel scheme on the multiple layers of CNNs, which can automatically select the discriminative representation by learning a linear combination from a set of pre-defined kernels. In addition, we introduce a large-scale dataset collected from popular comics of various countries, such as America, Japan, China, and France, which consists of 11,821 images with various artistic styles. Experimental results show that the multiple kernel network achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on the public affective datasets, as well as the newly established Comics dataset. The Comics dataset can be found at http://cv.nankai.edu.cn/projects/Comic.",

      "abstract": "Visual arts consist of various art forms, \\eg painting, sculpture, architecture,~\\etc, which not only enrich our lives but also involve works related to aesthetics, history, and culture. Different eras have different artistic appeals, and the art also has characteristics of each era in terms of expression and spiritual pursuit, in which style is an important attribute to describe visual arts. In order to recognize the style of visual arts more effectively, we present an end-to-end trainable architecture to learn a deep style representation. The main component of our architecture, adaptive cross-layer correlation, is inspired by the Gram matrix based correlation calculation. Our proposed method can adaptively weight features in different spatial locations based on their intrinsic similarity. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have shown their advantages in the salient object detection task. However, most existing FCNs-based methods still suffer from coarse object boundaries. In this paper, to solve this problem, we focus on the complementarity between salient edge information and salient object information. Accordingly, we present an edge guidance network (EGNet) for salient object detection with three steps to simultaneously model these two kinds of complementary information in a single network. In the first step, we extract the salient object features by a progressive fusion way. In the second step, we integrate the local edge information and global location information to obtain the salient edge features. Finally, to sufficiently leverage these complementary features, we couple the same salient edge features with salient object features at various resolutions. Benefiting from the rich edge information and location information in salient edge features, the fused features can help locate salient objects, especially their boundaries more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on six widely used datasets without any pre-processing and post-processing.

      "abstract": "Accurate grading of skin disease severity plays a crucial role in precise treatment for patients. Acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease in adolescence, can be graded by evidence-based lesion counting as well as experience-based global estimation in the medical field. However, due to the appearance similarity of acne with close severity, it is challenging to count and grade acne accurately. In this paper, we address the problem of acne image analysis via Label Distribution Learning (LDL) considering the ambiguous information among acne severity. Based on the professional grading criterion, we generate two acne label distributions considering the relationship between the similar number of lesions and severity of acne, respectively. We also propose a unified framework for joint acne image grading and counting, which is optimized by the multi-task learning loss. In addition, we further build the ACNE04 dataset with annotations of acne severity and lesion number of each image for evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. We make the code and dataset publicly available at https://github.com/xpwu95/ldl.",

      "abstract": "Image emotion recognition attracts much attention in recent years due to its wide applications. It aims to classify the emotional response of humans, where candidate emotion categories are generally defined by specific psychological theories, such as Ekman's six basic emotions. However, with the development of psychological theories, emotion categories become increasingly diverse, fine-grained, and difficult to collect samples. In this paper, we investigate zero-shot learning (ZSL) problem in the emotion recognition task, which tries to recognize the new unseen emotions. Specifically, we propose a novel affective-structural embedding framework, utilizing mid-level semantic representation, i.e., adjective-noun pairs (ANP) features, to construct an affective embedding space. By doing this, the learned intermediate space can narrow the semantic gap between low-level visual and high-level semantic features. In addition, we introduce an affective adversarial constraint to retain the discriminative capacity of visual features and the affective structural information of semantic features during training process. Our method is evaluated on five widely used affective datasets and the perimental results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Images play a crucial role for people to express their opinions online due to the increasing popularity of social networks. While an affective image retrieval system is useful for obtaining visual contents with desired emotions from a massive repository, the abstract and subjective characteristics make the task challenging. To address the problem, this paper introduces an Attention-aware Polarity Sensitive Embedding (APSE) network to learn affective representations in an end-to-end manner. First, to automatically discover and model the informative regions of interest, we develop a hierarchical attention mechanism, in which both polarity- and emotion-specific attended representations are aggregated for discriminative feature embedding. Second, we present a weighted emotion-pair loss to take the inter- and intra-polarity relationships of the emotional labels into consideration. Guided by attention module, we weight the sample pairs adaptively which further improves the performance of feature embedding. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Automatic assessment of sentiment from visual content has gained considerable attention with the increasing tendency of expressing opinions online. In this paper, we solve the problem of visual sentiment analysis, which is challenging due to the high-level abstraction in the recognition process. Existing methods based on convolutional neural networks learn sentiment representations from the holistic image, despite the fact that different image regions can have different influence on the evoked sentiment. In this paper, we introduce a weakly supervised coupled convolutional network (WSCNet). Our method is dedicated to automatically selecting relevant soft proposals from weak annotations (e.g., global image labels), thereby significantly reducing the annotation burden, and encompasses the following contributions. First, WSCNet detects a sentiment-specific soft map by training a fully convolutional network with the cross spatial pooling strategy in the detection branch. Second, both the holistic and localized information are utilized by coupling the sentiment map with deep features for robust representation in the classification branch. We integrate the sentiment detection and classification branches into a unified deep framework, and optimize the network in an end-to-end way. Through this joint learning strategy, weakly supervised sentiment classification and detection benefit each other. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed WSCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art results on seven benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Fine-grained classification is absorbed in recognizing the subordinate categories of one field, which need a large number of labeled images, while it is expensive to label these images. Utilizing web data has been an attractive option to meet the demands of training data for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially when the well-labeled data is not enough. However, directly training on such easily obtained images often leads to unsatisfactory performance due to factors such as noisy labels. This has been conventionally addressed by reducing the noise level of web data. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different view and propose an adversarial discriminative loss to advocate representation coherence between standard and web data. This is further encapsulated in a simple, scalable and end-to-end trainable multi-task learning framework. We experiment on three public datasets using large-scale web data to evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Class imbalance is a challenging problem in many classification tasks. It induces biased classification results for minority classes that contain less training samples than others. Most existing approaches aim to remedy the imbalanced number of instances among categories by resampling the majority and minority classes accordingly. However, the imbalanced level of difficulty of recognizing different categories is also crucial, especially for distinguishing samples with many classes. For example, in the task of clinical skin disease recognition, several rare diseases have a small number of training samples, but they are easy to diagnose because of their distinct visual properties. On the other hand, some common skin diseases, e.g., eczema, are hard to recognize due to the lack of special symptoms. To address this problem, we propose a self-paced balance learning (SPBL) algorithm in this paper. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive metric termed the complexity of image category that is a combination of both sample number and recognition difficulty. First, the complexity is initialized using the model of the first pace, where the pace indicates one iteration in the self-paced learning paradigm. We then assign each class a penalty weight that is larger for more complex categories and smaller for easier ones, after which the curriculum is reconstructed by rearranging the training samples. Consequently, the model can iteratively learn discriminative representations via balancing the complexity in each pace. Experimental results on the SD-198 and SD-260 benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed SPBL algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPBL algorithm's generalization capacity on various tasks, such as indoor scene image recognition and object classification.",

      "abstract": "Insect pests are one of the main factors affecting agricultural product yield. Accurate recognition of insect pests facilitates timely preventive measures to avoid economic losses. However, the existing datasets for the visual classification task mainly focus on common objects, e.g., flowers and dogs. This limits the application of powerful deep learning technology on specific domains like the agricultural field. In this paper, we collect a large-scale dataset named IP102 for insect pest recognition. Specifically, it contains more than 75, 000 images belonging to 102 categories, which exhibit a natural long-tailed distribution. In addition, we annotate about 19, 000 images with bounding boxes for object detection. The IP102 has a hierarchical taxonomy and the insect pests which mainly affect one specific agricultural product are grouped into the same upperlevel category. Furthermore, we perform several baseline experiments on the IP102 dataset, including handcrafted and deep feature based classification methods. Experimental results show that this dataset has the challenges of interand intra- class variance and data imbalance. We believe our IP102 will facilitate future research on practical insect pest control, fine-grained visual classification, and imbalanced learning fields. We make the dataset and pre-trained models publicly available at https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102.",

      "abstract": "Finding the informative subspaces of high-dimensional datasets is at the core of numerous applications in computer vision, where spectral-based subspace clustering is arguably the most widely studied method due to its strong empirical performance. Such algorithms first compute an affinity matrix to construct a self-representation for each sample using other samples as a dictionary. Sparsity and connectivity of the self-representation play important roles in effective subspace clustering. However, simultaneous optimization of both factors is difficult due to their conflicting nature, and most existing methods are designed to address only one factor. In this paper, we propose a post-processing technique to optimize both sparsity and connectivity by finding good neighbors. Good neighbors induce key connections among samples within a subspace and not only have large affinity coefficients but are also strongly connected to each other. We reassign the coefficients of the good neighbors and eliminate other entries to generate a new coefficient matrix. We show that the few good neighbors can effectively recover the subspace, and the proposed post-processing step of finding good neighbors is complementary to most existing subspace clustering algorithms. Experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods with negligible additional computation cost.",

      "abstract": "Annotating a large number of training images is very time-consuming. In this background, this paper focuses on learning from easy-to-acquire web data and utilizes the learned model for fine-grained image classification in labeled datasets. Currently, the performance gain from training with web data is incremental, like a common saying \"better than nothing, but not by much\". Conventionally, the community looks to correcting the noisy web labels to select informative samples. In this work, we first systematically study the built-in gap between the web and standard datasets, i.e. different data distributions between the two kinds of data. Then, in addition to using web labels, we present an unsupervised object localization method, which provides critical insights into the object density and scale in web images. Specifically, we design two constraints on web data to substantially reduce the difference of data distributions for the web and standard datasets. First, we present a method to control the scale, localization and number of objects in the detected region. Second, we propose to select the regions containing objects that are consistent with the web tag. Based on the two constraints, we are able to process web images to reduce the gap, and the processed web data is used to better assist the standard dataset to train CNNs. Experiments on several fine-grained image classification datasets confirm that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Analyzing and categorizing the style of visual art images, especially paintings, is gaining popularity owing to its importance in understanding and appreciating the art. The evolution of painting style is both continuous, in a sense that new styles may inherit, develop or even mutate from their predecessors and multi-modal because of various issues such as the visual appearance, the birthplace, the origin time and the art movement. Motivated by this peculiarity, we introduce a novel knowledge distilling strategy to assist visual feature learning in the convolutional neural network for painting style classification. More specifically, a multi-factor distribution is employed as soft-labels to distill complementary information with visual input, which extracts from different historical context via label distribution learning. The proposed method is well-encapsulated in a multi-task learning framework which allows end-to-end training. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches on Painting91, OilPainting, and Pandora datasets.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging the abundant number of web data is a promising strategy in addressing the problem of data lacking when training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the web images often contain incorrect tags, which may compromise the learned CNN model. To address this problem, this paper focuses on image classification and proposes to iterate between filtering out noisy web labels and fine-tuning the CNN model using the crawled web images. Overall, the proposed method benefits from the growing modeling capability of the learned model to correct labels for web images and learning from such new data to produce a more effective model. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose an iterative method that progressively improves the discriminative ability of CNNs and the accuracy of web image selection. This method is beneficial toward selecting high-quality web training images and expanding the training set as the model gets ameliorated. Second, since web images are usually complex and may not be accurately described by a single tag, we propose to assign a web image multiple labels to reduce the impact of hard label assignment. This labeling strategy mines more training samples to improve the CNN model. In the experiments, we crawl 0.5 million web images covering all categories of four public image classification data sets. Compared with the baseline which has no web images for training, we show that the proposed method brings notable improvement. We also report the competitive recognition accuracy compared with the state of the art.",

      "abstract": "Emotion analysis of on-line user generated textual content is important for natural language processing and social media analytics tasks. Most of previous emotion analysis approaches focus on identifying users’ emotional states from text by classifying emotions into one of the finite categories, e.g., joy, surprise, anger and fear. However, there exists ambiguity characteristic for the emotion analysis, since a single sentence can evoke multiple emotions with different intensities. To address this problem, we introduce emotion distribution learning and propose a multi-task convolutional neural network for text emotion analysis. The end-to-end framework optimizes the distribution prediction and classification tasks simultaneously, which is able to learn robust representations for the distribution dataset with annotations of different voters. While most work adopt the majority voting scheme for the ground truth labeling, we also propose a lexiconbased strategy to generate distributions from a single label, which provides prior information for the emotion classification. Experiments conducted on five public text datasets (i.e., SemEval, Fairy Tales, ISEAR, TEC, CBET) demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "For image retrieval methods based on bag of visual words, much attention has been paid to enhancing the discriminative powers of the local features. Although retrieved images are usually similar to a query in minutiae, they may be significantly different from a semantic perspective, which can be effectively distinguished by convolutional neural networks (CNN). Such images should not be considered as relevant pairs. To tackle this problem, we propose to construct a dynamic match kernel by adaptively calculating the matching thresholds between query and candidate images based on the pairwise distance among deep CNN features. In contrast to the typical static match kernel which is independent to the global appearance of retrieved images, the dynamic one leverages the semantical similarity as a constraint for determining the matches. Accordingly, we propose a semantic-constrained retrieval framework by incorporating the dynamic match kernel, which focuses on matched patches between relevant images and filters out the ones for irrelevant pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed kernel complements recent methods, such as hamming embedding, multiple assignment, local descriptors aggregation, and graph-based re-ranking, while it outperforms the static one under various settings on off-the-shelf evaluation metrics. We also propose to evaluate the matched patches both quantitatively and qualitatively. Extensive experiments on five benchmark data sets and large-scale distractors validate the merits of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art methods for image retrieval.",

      "abstract": "The skin is the largest organ in human body. Around 30%-70% of individuals worldwide have skin related health problems, for whom effective and efficient diagnosis is necessary. Recently, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been successfully applied to the recognition of skin cancers in dermatoscopic images. However, little work has concentrated on the commonly encountered skin diseases in clinical images captured by easily-accessed cameras or mobile phones. Meanwhile, for a CAD system, the representations of skin lesions are required to be understandable for dermatologists so that the predictions are convincing. To address this problem, we present effective representations inspired by the accepted dermatological criteria for diagnosing clinical skin lesions. We demonstrate that the dermatological criteria are highly correlated with measurable visual components. Accordingly, we design six medical representations considering different criteria for the recognition of skin lesions, and construct a diagnosis system for clinical skin disease images. Experimental results show that the proposed medical representations can not only capture the manifestations of skin lesions effectively, and consistently with the dermatological criteria, but also improve the prediction performance with respect to the state-of-the-art methods based on uninterpretable features.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses both the model selection (i.e., estimating the number of clusters K) and subspace clustering problems in a unified model. The real data always distribute on a union of low-dimensional sub-manifolds which are embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. In this regard, the state-of-the-art subspace clustering approaches firstly learn the affinity among samples, followed by a spectral clustering to generate the segmentation. However, arguably, the intrinsic geometrical structures among samples are rarely considered in the optimization process. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously estimate K and segment the samples according to the local similarity relationships derived from the affinity matrix. Given the correlations among samples, we define a novel data structure termed the Triplet, each of which reflects a high relevance and locality among three samples which are aimed to be segmented into the same subspace. While the traditional pairwise distance can be close between inter-cluster samples lying on the intersection of two subspaces, the wrong assignments can be avoided by the hyper-correlation derived from the proposed triplets due to the complementarity of multiple constraints. Sequentially, we propose to greedily optimize a new model selection reward to estimate K according to the correlations between inter-cluster triplets. We simultaneously optimize a fusion reward based on the similarities between triplets and clusters to generate the final segmentation. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "With the explosion of visual information nowadays, millions of digital images are available to the users. How to efficiently explore a large set of images and retrieve useful information thus becomes extremely important. Unfortunately only some of the images can impress the user at first glance. Others that make little sense in human perception are often discarded, while still costing valuable time and space. Therefore, it is significant to identify these two kinds of images for relieving the load of online repositories and accelerating information retrieval process. However, most of the existing image properties, e.g., memorability and popularity, are based on repeated human interactions, which limit the research and application of evaluating image quality in terms of instantaneous impression. In this paper, we propose a novel image property, called impressiveness, that measures how images impress people with a short-term contact. This is based on an impression-driven model inspired by a number of important human perceptual cues. To achieve this, we first collect three datasets in various domains, which are labeled according to the instantaneous sensation of the annotators. Then we investigate the impressiveness property via six established human perceptual cues as well as the corresponding features from pixel to semantic levels. Sequentially, we verify the consistency of the impressiveness which can be quantitatively measured by multiple visual representations, and evaluate their latent relationships. Finally, we apply the proposed impressiveness property to rank the images for an efficient image recommendation system.",

      "abstract": "Affective image understanding has been extensively studied in the last decade since more and more users express emotion via visual contents. While current algorithms based on convolutional neural networks aim to distinguish emotional categories in a discrete label space, the task is inherently ambiguous. This is mainly because emotional labels with the same polarity (i.e., positive or negative) are highly related, which is different from concrete object concepts such as cat, dog and bird. To the best of our knowledge, few methods focus on leveraging such characteristic of emotions for affective image understanding. In this work, we address the problem of understanding affective images via deep metric learning and propose a multi-task deep framework to optimize both retrieval and classification goals. We propose the sentiment constraints adapted from the triplet constraints, which are able to explore the hierarchical relation of emotion labels. We further exploit the sentiment vector as an effective representation to distinguish affective images utilizing the texture representation derived from convolutional layers. Extensive evaluations on four widely-used affective datasets, i.e., Flickr and Instagram, IAPSa, Art Photo, and Abstract Paintings, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on both affective image retrieval and classification tasks.",

      "abstract": "Automatic assessment of sentiment from visual&#13;\\ncontent has gained considerable attention with the increasing&#13;\\ntendency of expressing opinions via images and videos online.&#13;\\nThis paper investigates the problem of visual sentiment analysis,&#13;\\nwhich involves a high-level abstraction in the recognition process.&#13;\\nWhile most of the current methods focus on improving holistic&#13;\\nrepresentations, we aim to utilize the local information, which is&#13;\\ninspired by the observation that both the whole image and local&#13;\\nregions convey significant sentiment information. We propose&#13;\\na framework to leverage affective regions, where we first use&#13;\\nan off-the-shelf objectness tool to generate the candidates, and&#13;\\nemploy a candidate selection method to remove redundant and&#13;\\nnoisy proposals. Then a convolutional neural network (CNN) is&#13;\\nconnected with each candidate to compute the sentiment scores,&#13;\\nand the affective regions are automatically discovered, taking the&#13;\\nobjectness score as well as the sentiment score into consideration.&#13;\\nFinally, the CNN outputs from local regions are aggregated with&#13;\\nthe whole images to produce the final predictions. Our framework&#13;\\nonly requires image-level labels, thereby significantly reducing&#13;\\nthe annotation burden otherwise required for training. This is&#13;\\nespecially important for sentiment analysis as sentiment can be&#13;\\nabstract, and labeling affective regions is too subjective and&#13;\\nlabor-consuming. Extensive experiments show that the proposed&#13;\\nalgorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on eight&#13;\\npopular benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Visual sentiment analysis is attracting more and more attention with the increasing tendency to express emotions through visual contents. Recent algorithms in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) considerably advance the emotion classification, which aims to distinguish differences among emotional categories and assigns a single dominant label to each image. However, the task is inherently ambiguous since an image usually evokes multiple emotions and its annotation varies from person to person. In this work, we address the problem via label distribution learning (LDL) and develop a multi-task deep framework by jointly optimizing both classification and distribution prediction. While the proposed method prefers to the distribution dataset with annotations of different voters, the majority voting scheme is widely adopted as the ground truth in this area, and few dataset has provided multiple affective labels. Hence, we further exploit two weak forms of prior knowledge, which are expressed as similarity information between labels, to generate emotional distribution for each category. The experiments conducted on both distribution datasets, i.e., Emotion6, Flickr_LDL, Twitter_LDL, and the largest single emotion dataset, i.e., Flickr and Instagram, demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Visual sentiment analysis is raising more and more attention with the increasing tendency to express emotions through images. While most existing works assign a single dominant emotion to each image, we address the sentiment ambiguity by label distribution learning (LDL), which is motivated by the fact that image usually evokes multiple emotions. Two new algorithms are developed based on conditional probability neural network (CPNN). First, we proposed BCPNN which encodes image label into a binary representation to replace the signless integers used in CPNN, and employ it as a part of input for the neural network. Then, we train our ACPNN model by adding noises to ground truth label and augmenting affective distributions. Since current datasets are mostly annotated for single-label learning, we build two new datasets, one of which is relabeled on the popular Flickr dataset and the other is collected from Twitter. These datasets contain 20,745 images with multiple affective labels, which are over ten times larger than the existing ones. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art works on our large-scale datasets and other publicly available benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of automatically recognizing emotions in still images. While most of current work focus on improving whole-image representations using CNNs, we argue that discovering affective regions and supplementing local features will boost the performance, which is inspired by the observation that both global distributions and salient objects carry massive sentiments. We propose an algorithm to discover affective regions via deep framework, in which we use an off-the-shelf tool to generate N object proposals from a query image and rank these proposals with their objectness scores. Then, each proposal's sentiment score is computed using a pre-trained and fine-tuned CNN model. We combine both scores and select top K regions from the N candidates. These K regions are regarded as the most affective ones of the input image. Finally, we extract deep features from the whole-image and the selected regions, respectively, and sentiment label is predicted. The experiments show that our method is able to detect the affective local regions and achieve state-of-the-art performances on several popular datasets.",

First, edge information is extracted from the query image and compared with each sample of training set, which can help us retrieve a subset of candidate proposals. These proposals are used to learn prior shape knowledge by separately estimating the foreground probabilities of corresponding pixels in the query image. Then, a redefined energy function is introduced to translate the minimum of energy to a good segmentation, with which we can dynamically pick out the most preferable proposal. After that, we obtain the label map of the image at the pixel level. Finally, the high-quality segmentation is used to aid locating semantic parts. We fine-tune one global model and two part models on Caffe to extract deep features and use a learned SVM classifier for categorization. We test three aspects in our experiment, including foreground segmentation, part localization and final classification. The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the famous Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 dataset.",

      "abstract": "Partial blur sometimes occurs in the document images captured by a camera, which will influence the performance of OCR on the non-blurred text region. A real-time method, named MRRI, is proposed in this paper to identify the machine-readable region from partially blurred document images. Firstly, a reference image is generated by low-pass filtering on the given document image. Secondly, a weight matrix is generated by calculating the structural similarity for each patch. Thirdly, a cost function is minimized to identify the maximum machine-readable region that can be well-recognized by OCR. In experiments, two applications are considered with the identified machine-readable region. On one hand, Tesseract-OCR is used for the word recognition to build index for a given document image. Compared with the results by applying OCR on the whole image, more words are correctly recognized by applying OCR on the identified region. On the other hand, the identified machine-readable region is used to assess the quality of a document image. Compared with other two image quality assessment methods, the machine-readable region based method shows a better performance. Also, MRRI is light and time-saving, which can meet the requirement of real-time applications.",

Spectrum-based fault localization techniques (SFL) make use of runtime coverage of program elements, like statements, branches and du-pairs, and then check codes in the order of the rank of suspiciousness. So, correct elements with higher suspiciousness than faulty elements cause the loss of precision. In this paper, we focus on a situation where suspiciousness calculated according to coverage and outcome, i.e. Successful or failing, is higher than it should be. It is found that when a branch structure is repeatedly executed, which is normal in real-life programs, and all of its branches are covered within a run, a branch related to faults could lead other branches to be doubted. To reduce effects between branches, we do the following things: First, we utilize branches to monitor program behaviors, second, we take test cases with high similarities as triggered by the same fault, third, for branches mentioned, we propose an algorithm to infer which branch is more likely to be faulty in the failure, finally, experiments based on Siemens benchmark set and flex show that our approach is useful to heighten the ranking of faulty elements by reducing suspiciousness of correct branches.",

      "abstract": "SQL Injection Vulnerability (SQLIV) is one of the topmost serious threats to web applications. Penetration test is one of the most important approaches to detect SQLIV. The test case generation issue critically affects the effectiveness of penetration test. Thus, research on the approaches to improve coverage and efficiency of test case generation process in SQLIV penetration test is of great importance. This paper proposes a formalized SQLIV test case generation model. i) We propose Global Test Rule (GTR), which is used to generate test cases in the process of SQLIV detection. ii) We present SQL injection vulnerability Test Matrix (SQLTM) model, which is a three dimensional matrix, to generate the set of GTR. iii) Based on the GTR generated by the above steps, we propose a Multiple Phases Detection Approach (MPDA) to implement the dynamic generation of test cases and detection procedure control, and then we give its algorithms in detail. Experiment results show that our approach can improve the coverage, precision and efficiency of SQLIV detection by a comparison with two real products for enterprise projects.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new tool, RL_Detector, which performs static analysis to detect resource leaks for C programs. The algorithm is inter-procedural and path-sensitive, and it is based on an underlying resource management property: the data flow from resource allocation point must reach resource deallocation point, otherwise the resource is leaked. For each resource, it symbolically executes the program to collect the constraints of all the paths and recorded as some sets. Then the data flow condition can be computed through these sets of all the paths. Finally, the resource leak detection is reduced to the satisfiability of DFC (the Data Flow Condition). It has been effective at detecting resource leak in the SPEC2000 benchmarks and in an open source software project, the actual test results show that the tool keeps the false positive rate below 10% and works on millions of lines of code in a matter of minutes.",

      "abstract": "Binarization of natural images is important for text location and content-based analysis. In this work, a new adaptive method is introduced. It is able to improve the binarization results on the degraded images, such as the complex background, the non-uniform illumination, the variations of text font, size, color, and line orientation. The presented method contains three main stages. Firstly, original threshold of each pixel is calculated to produce some candidate blocks. Secondly, the new inter- and intra-block features are extracted from the candidates based on the characteristics of text. Finally, each block is scored from 0 to s using the mentioned features. The blocks with low scores are considered as subcomponents of background. After extensive experiments, our method demonstrated superior performance against two well-known techniques on the ICDAR 2005 competition dataset.",

The test case is an important factor affecting the penetration test accuracy. In this paper, we discuss how to generate more effective penetration test case inputs to detect the SQL injection vulnerability hidden behind the inadequate blacklist filter defense mechanism in web applications. We propose a model based penetration test method for the SQL injection vulnerability, in which the penetration test case generation is divided into two steps: i) Building model for the penetration test case, and ii) Instantiating the model of penetration test case. Our method can generate test case covering more types and patterns of SQL injection attack input to thoroughly test the blacklist filter mechanism of web applications. Experiments show the penetration test case generated by our method can effectively find the SQL injection vulnerabilities hidden behind the inadequate blacklist filter defense mechanism thus reduce the false negative and improve test accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Internet-scale software becomes an important mode of constructing software systems with the development of internet. Open, dynamic and uncontrollable Internet environment makes dependability evaluation of Internet-scale software very important. It is lack of a dependability evaluation model that analyzes system architecture from the most foundational elements and integrate aspects that impacts on the system, such as the technical, organizational, decisional and human aspects. This paper proposes an evaluation model of dependability for Internet-scale software on the basis of Bayesian Networks. The model analyzes the structure of Internet-scale software and establishes an evaluation system of dependability for Internet-scale software including static metrics, dynamic metrics, prior metrics and correction metrics. It integrates subjective and objective factors which impact on system quality. In this paper, we build Bayesian Network according to the structure analysis and refer to a bottom-up method that use Bayesian reasoning to analyses and calculate entity dependability and integration dependability layer by layer. A unified dependability of the whole system is worked out and is corrected by objective data. The analysis of experiment in a real system proves that the model in this paper is capable of evaluating the dependability of Internet-scale software clearly and objectively. Moreover, it offers effective help to the design, development, deployment and assessment of Internet-scale software.",

Since the symbols are often written connected and cannot be easily segmented, the recognition of the whole formula faces challenge. In this paper, we present a method for handling the connected areas in online handwritten chemical formulas. The formula is preprocessed firstly and then both of structure features and time features are combined for segmentation. Benzene ring is a very common structure in chemical formulas, so we employ the freshman chain code to separate it from the chemical bond when they are connected. Experiment results show that the proposed method can work with a high accuracy of more than 90%.",

This paper adopts 108 chemical symbols which are comprised of inorganic chemical symbols, organic ring structures, chemical bonds and laboratory apparatus. The recognizing process is divided into four steps. The first is adjusting and optimizing the handwritten data. Then, eight-directional features are extracted from each trajectory point. In the third stage, the features are optimized by maximum filter and Gaussian filter. The MQDF classifier is used for recognition of handwritten chemical symbols at last. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust and flexible.",

Firstly, the system continuously captures images by camera connected to the computer, and then determines whether there exists an available hand area based on the HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) color model. It takes advantage of Fourier descriptors and K nearest neighbor classification to distinguish four different gestures. Finally, Microsoft Office PowerPoint can be controlled by the command corresponding to the identified gestures. Experiment results show that the system can meet the requirements of practical applications.",

This paper focuses on the research on black box testing for the SQL injection vulnerability. Through the combination of fuzzy test and mock attack testing, a new testing method for hunting SQL injection is proposed, in which the injection parameters can be divided into several sets of equivalence classes according to the defined multi-defense levels of testee web systems. By injecting the most representative parameters selected from each equivalence classes, the mock attack testing for hunting SQL injection can be very effective and low cost. Experimental result shows that this method can achieve desirable result for SQLI mock attack testing in real web applications.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach to separate connected symbols in online handwritten chemical formulas. The proposed method combines both the chemical structural characteristics and online information. The main process can be divided into three stages: preprocessing, location of connected point, and segmentation. In addition, organic ring, a common chemical structure, is much different from other chemical symbols. We adopt the Freeman chain code to separate ring from chemical bond when they are connected. Experiment results show that the proposed method can not only satisfy the real-time demand, but also achieve a high correct segmentation rate of 92.7%.",

For the common inorganic chemical formula, locating and recognizing the operators are key issues. This paper summarizes the chemical operators and divides them into three types. Based on the features of these operators, a novel 3-layer recognition model is proposed, which consists of pre-processing, segmentation and substance recognizing. Taking the heating operator and gas operator as examples, we describe the major structural features of chemical operators. Experimental results show that the method is robust and feasible.",

With the structural characteristics, semantic rules, and more importantly grammatical rules, the analyzing process is divided into 3 levels: formula level, molecule level, and text level. A formal description of the chemical formula based-on the grammatical rules is summed up and applied to the analyzing process which generates grammar spanning graphs from the analyzed result step-by-step, and that is used for the further structure representation and data retrieval. Our work, as an important component of applying mobile computing research in education, is proved effective and promising.",

This method is based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), which are increasingly being used to model characters. We built an HMM for each symbol and used 11-dimensional local features which are suitable for online handwritten recognition, and obtained top-1 accuracy of 89.5% and top-3 accuracy of 98.7% on a dataset containing 5,670 train samples and 2,016 test samples. These initial results are promising and warrant further research in this direction.",

By observing a large number of formula samples, we classify the common broken problems in online handwritten chemical formulas into three types, ldquopoint-likerdquo broken type, liner-type and arc-type. The proposed method combines the strokes characteristic of handwritten chemical characters, online information and structural characteristics of chemical formulas. The main process can be divided into three stages: preprocessing, location of broken strokes and linking. Experiment results indicate that the proposed method can not only satisfy the real-time demand, but also achieve a high linking accuracy of 94.0%.",

We put forward a set of operations, including eleven independent gestures, which are easy to recognize and quick to learn. In gesture recognition section, we propose a two-tier classification, which deals with the global as well as the local features of gestures. The results show that these gestures are well-designed and easy to recognize. We have applied these gestures to the chemical formula editing system.",

In the first level, structural information is used to distinguish different parts and recognize substances. Then the algorithm segments expressions fatherly and recognizes isolated symbols. To meet the demand of actual applications, the paper also designs an XML-based system to help users save, modify and search the recognition result. The experiment shows that the presented algorithm is reliable.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the major modules of on-line handwritten chemical expressions recognition. We propose a novel algorithm that combines two separate methods to segment expressions, one of which is based on structural information and the other on partial recognition. The algorithm improves the traditional algorithm at the stage of recognition, which consists of a substance recognizer and a character recognizer. To meet the demand of actual applications, the paper also designs a standard feature set to deal with the related issues and presents a flexible process of human-computer interaction to help users modify the recognition result. The experimental results show that the presented algorithm is reliable.",

However, in many cases the training set is too small so that cross-validation cannot be applied. Aiming at the problem, a new validation method based on expanded training sets is proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that the generalization ability of neural networks can be greatly improved by the proposed validation method.",

As an improved ANN network model, the pre-edited ANN classifier shows better practical performance than the standard one. However, no related theoretical research has been conducted on it. To provide a theoretical support for the pre-edited ANN classifier, the asymptotic optimization is studied in this paper. Furthermore, a simulation is presented to provide an experimental support for our theoretical work.",

The object of RTS is the set of dynamic data pages distributed in 35 airlinespsila websites. Our prototype will acquire these pages and locate the feature regions where we can extract real time information of tickets. In decision layer, we filter and sort these data to supply our end-users with all the potential tickets information they need and allow them to book tickets by our agent. The process relies on a series of rules of structure, logic and business applications. Experiment results show that the proposed prototype is robust and feasible.",

The model has four layers, among which the access schedule, extraction layer and data cleaner are based on the rules of structure, logic and application. In the experiment section, we apply the new model to three intelligent system, scientific paper retrieval, electronic ticket ordering and resume searching. The results show that the proposed method is robust and feasible.",
