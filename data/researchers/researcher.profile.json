          "abstract": "Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\\% in accuracy and 1.26\\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.",

          "abstract": "Transformer-based approaches have shown promising performance in image restoration tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies, which are essential for recovering clear images. Although various efficient attention mechanisms have been proposed to address the intensive computational loads of transformers, they often suffer from redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions, as they consider all available tokens. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST-v2) to mitigate these issues by reducing noisy interactions in irrelevant areas and removing feature redundancy along channel dimension. AST-v2 incorporates two core components: an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). ASSA adopts a dual-branch design, where the sparse branch guides the modulation of standard dense attention weights. This paradigm reduces the negative impact of irrelevant token interactions while preserving the important ones. Meanwhile, FRFN utilizes an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy across channels, enhancing the restoration of clear images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks show the competitive performance of our method for 6 restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, haze removal, shadow removal, snow removal, blur removal, and low-light enhancement. The code is available in the supplementary materials.",

          "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in https://zzcheng.top/MODA.",

It is time to pay attention to more complex vision tasks, as model size, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities continue to improve. In this paper, we introduce and review a family of complex tasks, termed Concealed Dense Prediction (CDP), which has great value in agriculture, industry, etc. CDP's intrinsic trait is that the targets are concealed in their surroundings, thus fully perceiving them requires fine-grained representations, prior knowledge, auxiliary reasoning, etc. The contributions of this review are three-fold: (i) We introduce the scope, characteristics, and challenges specific to CDP tasks and emphasize their essential differences from generic vision tasks. (ii) We develop a taxonomy based on concealment counteracting to summarize deep learning efforts in CDP through experiments on three tasks. We compare 25 state-of-the-art methods across 12 widely used concealed datasets. (iii) We discuss the potential applications of CDP in the large model era and summarize 6 potential research directions. We offer perspectives for the future development of CDP by constructing a large-scale multimodal instruction fine-tuning dataset, CvpINST, and a concealed visual perception agent, CvpAgent.",

The planning horizon for each dealer is divided into the replenishment cycle series, accounting for the lead time associated with each joint replenishment cycle. A shortest path model is developed. Through mathematical analysis, the safety stock variables are eliminated, and the multiple variables are reduced to replenishment variables only. The stochastic problem is converted to the deterministic dynamic lot-sizing through expectation analysis. Furthermore, the MLS-MRS heuristic is proposed based on Robinson's Left-Right shift (LS-RS) heuristic by adding a module, the positive cost-saving family shifts. This algorithm improves the optimal solution and notably greatly increases the search speed.",

Seeking consistent k-nearest neighbors in both coordinate and feature spaces is a prevalent strategy employed in previous approaches. However, the vicinity of an inlier contains numerous irregular false correspondences (outliers), which leads them to mistakenly become neighbors according to the similarity constraint of nearest neighbors. To tackle this issue, we propose a global-graph space to seek consistent neighbors with similar graph structures. This is achieved by using a global connected graph to explicitly render the affinity relationship between correspondences based on the spatial and feature consistency. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of method for various matching scenes, we develop a neighbor consistency block to adequately leverage the potential of three types of neighbors. The consistency can be progressively mined by sequentially extracting intra-neighbor context and exploring inter-neighbor interactions. Ultimately, we present a Neighbor Consistency Mining Network (NCMNet) to estimate the parametric models and remove outliers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks for two-view geometry estimation. Meanwhile, four extended tasks, including remote sensing image registration, point cloud registration, 3D reconstruction, and visual localization, are conducted to test the generalization ability.",

          "abstract": "Intense light sources often produce flares in captured images at night, which deteriorates the visual quality and negatively affects downstream applications. In order to train an effective flare removal network, a reliable dataset is essential. The mainstream flare removal datasets are semi-synthetic to reduce human labour, but these datasets do not cover typical scenarios involving multiple scattering flares. To tackle this issue, we synthesize a prior-guided dataset named Flare7K*, which contains multi-flare images where the brightness of flares adheres to the laws of illumination. Besides, flares tend to occupy localized regions of the image but existing networks perform flare removal on the entire image and sometimes modify clean areas incorrectly. Therefore, we propose a plug-and-play Adaptive Focus Module (AFM) that can adaptively mask the clean background areas and assist models in focusing on the regions severely affected by flares. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our data synthesis method can better simulate real-world scenes and several models equipped with AFM achieve state-of-the-art performance on the real-world test dataset.",

          "abstract": "Exploring motion information is important for the motion deblurring task. Recent the window-based transformer approaches have achieved decent performance in image deblurring. Note that the motion causing blurry results is usually composed of translation and rotation movements and the window-shift operation in the Cartesian coordinate system by the window-based transformer approaches only directly explores translation motion in orthogonal directions. Thus, these methods have the limitation of modeling the rotation part. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the polar coordinate-based transformer, which has the angles and distance to explore rotation motion and translation information together. In this paper, we propose a Radial Strip Transformer (RST), which is a transformer-based architecture that restores the blur images in a polar coordinate system instead of a Cartesian one. RST contains a dynamic radial embedding module (DRE) to extract the shallow feature by a radial deformable convolution. We design a polar mask layer to generate the offsets for the deformable convolution, which can reshape the convolution kernel along the radius to better capture the rotation motion information. Furthermore, we proposed a radial strip attention solver (RSAS) as deep feature extraction, where the relationship of windows is organized by azimuth and radius. This attention module contains radial strip windows to reweight image features in the polar coordinate, which preserves more useful information in rotation and translation motion together for better recovering the sharp images. Experimental results on six synthesis and real-world datasets prove that our method performs favorably against other SOTA methods for the image deblurring task.",

          "abstract": "Emotions can be perceived from a person's gait, i.e., their walking style. Existing methods on gait emotion recognition mainly leverage the posture information as input, but ignore the body movement, which contains complementary information for recognizing emotions evoked in the gait. In this paper, we propose a Bilateral Posture and Movement Graph Convolutional Network (BPM-GCN) that consists of two parallel streams, namely posture stream and movement stream, to recognize emotions from two views. The posture stream aims to explicitly analyse the emotional state of the person. Specifically, we design a novel regression constraint based on the hand-engineered features to distill the prior affective knowledge into the network and boost the representation learning. The movement stream is designed to describe the intensity of the emotion, which is an implicitly cue for recognizing emotions. To achieve this goal, we employ a higher-order velocity-acceleration pair to construct graphs, in which the informative movement features are utilized. Besides, we design a PM-Interacted feature fusion mechanism to adaptively integrate the features from the two streams. Therefore, the two streams collaboratively contribute to the performance from two complementary views. Extensive experiments on the largest benchmark dataset Emotion-Gait show that BPM-GCN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches (with at least 4.59% performance improvement). The source code is released on https://github.com/exped1230/BPM-GCN .",
