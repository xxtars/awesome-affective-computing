A strong emphasis emerges on distributional robustness, contrastive and disentangled representation learning, and bridging computational models with psychological theory—evident in work spanning depression estimation, death education interventions, emotional video captioning, and affective art analysis. Recent trends show increasing integration of vision-language models (e.g., PsycoLLM, Emotional VLMs) and generative methods for emotion-aware AI, alongside rigorous benchmarking (e.g., MAC challenges) and noise-robust learning for imperfect real-world annotations.",

      "abstract": "Background Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) constitution theory posits that constitution is dynamic, yet most research is cross-sectional. This study aims to bridge this gap by developing machine learning models using longitudinal cohort data to predict dynamic constitutional changes in the elderly. The objectives were twofold: to predict an individual’s specific constitution type at a future time point and to classify the transformation trend between assessments. Methods This study utilized a large-scale longitudinal cohort, including 54,990 records from the TCM Elderly Constitution Questionnaire (TCMECQ) for model development and 2,181 records for external validation. Five machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Network (NN), were trained and validated. Model training and evaluation were performed using 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness. We defined two predictive outcomes: the specific future constitution type (nine-class) and the transformation trend (“better,” “indeterminate,” or “worse”), classified based on expert consensus. We also evaluated the predictive performance of 13 common biochemical indicators. Results For predicting the specific future constitution type, SVM demonstrated the best performance with an internal validation accuracy of 99.47%. In the core task of classifying the transformation trend, the RFC model was superior, achieving an accuracy of 96.92% (Kappa = 0.9505). However, all models performed poorly when predicting the “worse” trend in external validation. Analyses using biochemical indicators showed moderate performance for identifying “better” (accuracy &amp;gt;80%) and “indeterminate” (accuracy &amp;gt;90%) states but failed to predict the “worse” trend (accuracy &amp;lt;5%). Conclusion This study establishes the first machine learning framework to effectively predict the dynamic evolution of TCM constitution. Our findings show that SVM excels at predicting specific future states, while RFC is more adept at capturing overall evolutionary trends. This framework provides a novel quantitative tool for advancing proactive health management aligned with the TCM principle of “Zhi Wei Bing”. The models’ inability to reliably predict constitutional deterioration highlights the critical need to incorporate multi-modal data to capture complex pathophysiological mechanisms in future research.",

      "abstract": "Video-based multimodal depression estimation is a challenging task that relies on comprehensive video understanding and analysis to predict depression severity. This process involves capturing discriminative information from multimodal features, including auditory, textual, and visual signals in the video data. Existing foundation models primarily focus on fusing multimodal features but often overlook two essential aspects: (1) the alignment of intra- and inter-modality , and (2) preserving modality-specific semantic information while eliminating redundancy . Hence, these issues inevitably result in semantic misalignment between modalities, leading the model to learn redundant or even conflicting representations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Contrastive Modality Alignment and Fusion (CMAF) framework. Specifically, each modality is divided into multiple segments, and a dynamic normalization strategy is applied to align the temporal context within each modality. Simultaneously, contrastive learning is utilized to achieve semantic alignment across different modalities. Together, these components form the Contextual Modality Alignment (CMA) module. Furthermore, a Cross-Attention Contrastive Fusion (CCF) module is presented, where cross-attention is used to achieve complementarity and enhancement between modalities, while contrastive learning further promotes modal consistency and preserves modality-specific information without redundancy. Therefore, the fused representation can integrate the features of each modality without losing the specific information of the unimodal. Extensive experiments on public datasets, including CMDC, DAIC-WOZ, and E-DAIC, demonstrate that CMAF outperforms advanced depression estimation methods and highlights the essence of effective alignment and fusion.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design, improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then, based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses, enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall (UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.",

      "abstract": "Cross-category object perception is one of the essential upstream tasks for generelizable robot object interaction and manipulation. Recently, an increasing number of researchers are focusing on investigating visual Generalizable and Actionable Parts understanding at cross-category level perception. However, these works are built upon the RGB-D or point cloud input, that relies on the depth information capture. Under the circumstances of limited depth camera performance, e.g. transparent or light absorbing material, perception algorithms that do not require depth information are urgently needed. In this paper, we propose DFGAP, a novel depth-free framework for RGB-based GAParts segmentation and pose estimation. Specifically, we independently model the ill-pose problems from the absence of depth for GAPart segmentation and pose estimation, by clearly quantifying the pixel-wise segmentation probability and relative depth. We reduce the uncertainty and benefit learning in these two tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our DFGAP. Our work provides a new research paradigm in GAParts perception. We believe that our work has the enormous potential to be applied in many areas of embodied AI system.",

      "abstract": "Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input. Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE (KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their kinematic properties.",

      "abstract": "Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.",

      "abstract": "Lipreading refers to translating the lip movements observed in a video of a speaker into corresponding textual outputs, providing a visual alternative to auditory communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Existing lipreading methods typically independently learn the lip movements of each speaker. This results in the model being highly sensitive to the individual visual features (lip color/shape) of the speakers in the training set, hindering the generalization of lipreading models. Despite the obvious visual variations in the lips of different speakers, we claim that there are still inherent common features when they pronounce the same phoneme. We attempt to learn the common pronunciation features across different speakers, so as to achieve better generalization of lipreading model to unseen speakers. In this article, we propose a sentence-level lipreading framework based on Learning Common Features (CFLip), designed to extract common pronunciation features from <real-pseudo> video pairs. Specifically, we first employ data augmentation strategy to generate pseudo videos that share labels but with different speakers by replacing frame segments in real videos. With these <real-pseudo> video pairs, we designed a dual-stream network to learn commonality feature by minimized the distance between the features of different speakers pronouncing the same words via Generalization Loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CFLip can effectively generalize to unseen speakers.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team, HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.",

      "abstract": "Face recognition systems are vulnerable to physical attacks (e.g., printed photos) and digital threats (e.g., DeepFake), which are currently being studied as independent visual tasks, such as Face Anti-Spoofing and Forgery Detection. The inherent differences among various attack types present significant challenges in identifying a common feature space, making it difficult to develop a unified framework for detecting data from both attack modalities simultaneously. Inspired by the efficacy of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in learning across diverse domains, we explore utilizing multiple experts to learn the distinct features of various attack types. However, the feature distributions of physical and digital attacks overlap and differ. This suggests that relying solely on distinct experts to learn the unique features of each attack type may overlook shared knowledge between them. To address these issues, we propose SUEDE, the Shared Unified Experts for Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection Enhancement. SUEDE combines a shared expert (always activated) to capture common features for both attack types and multiple routed experts (selectively activated) for specific attack types. Further, we integrate CLIP as the base network to ensure the shared expert benefits from prior visual knowledge and align visual-text representations in a unified space. Extensive results demonstrate SUEDE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unified detection methods.",

      "abstract": "Gaze following is a fundamental challenge in computer vision that enables systems to infer where humans are looking in complex scenes, with applications spanning human-computer interaction, social robotics, and behavioral analysis. Traditional approaches to this task often rely on multi-stream architectures or transformer-based methods with inherent limitations. Current transformer-based methods face three major challenges: randomly initialized queries lack prior information about human positions; the conventional query-object paradigm necessitates numerous queries, resulting in expensive bipartite matching; and traditional global attention mechanism demands substantial resources, forcing trade-offs that sacrifice crucial facial detail features. We address these challenges by introducing a more efficient framework with three corresponding innovations: a position-aware query initialization that encodes head coordinates through sinusoidal positional encoding, incorporating prior knowledge of human head positions; a task-specific query assignment strategy that redefines the query-object relationship, remarkably reducing the number of required queries; and an enhanced sparse attention mechanism that is introduced to accelerate model convergence, enabling processing of higher resolution images without significantly increasing demands. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among single-modality methods, reducing the two distance metrics by 20.4% and 28.1%, respectively, while cutting the number of learnable parameters by 71.9%. Additionally, our model outperforms most multi-modality approaches in terms of AUC metrics and distance metrics with faster convergence.",

Upon thorough examination, we observe that accurate fine-grained cross-modal semantic alignment between the image and text is vital for accurately manipulation detection and grounding. While existing DGM<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> methods pay rare attention to the cross-modal alignment, hampering the accuracy of manipulation detecting to step further. To remedy this issue, this work targets to advance the semantic alignment learning to promote this task. Particularly, we utilize the off-the-shelf large models to construct paired image-text pairs, especially for the manipulated instances. Subsequently, a cross-modal alignment learning is performed to enhance the semantic alignment. Besides the explicit auxiliary clues, we further design a Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA) to provide implicit guidance for augmenting the manipulation perceiving. With the grounding truth available during training, MGCA encourages the model to concentrate more on manipulated components while downplaying normal ones, enhancing the model’s ability to capture manipulations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DGM<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> dataset, the results demonstrate that our model can surpass the comparison method with a clear margin.

      "abstract": "Generating continuous sign language videos from discrete segments is challenging due to the need for smooth transitions that preserve natural flow and meaning. Traditional approaches that simply concatenate isolated signs often result in abrupt transitions, disrupting video coherence. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Sign-D2C, that employs a conditional diffusion model to synthesize contextually smooth transition frames, enabling the seamless construction of continuous sign language sequences. Our approach transforms the unsupervised problem of transition frame generation into a supervised training task by simulating the absence of transition frames through random masking of segments in long-duration sign videos. The model learns to predict these masked frames by denoising Gaussian noise, conditioned on the surrounding sign observations, allowing it to handle complex, unstructured transitions. During inference, we apply a linearly interpolating padding strategy that initializes missing frames through interpolation between boundary frames, providing a stable foundation for iterative refinement by the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T, USTCCSL100, and USTC-SLR500 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing continuous, natural sign language videos.",

EgoTextVQA contains 1.5K ego-view videos and 7K scene-text aware questions that reflect real user needs in outdoor driving and indoor house-keeping activities. The questions are designed to elicit identification and reasoning on scene text in an egocentric and dynamic environment. With EgoTextVQA, we comprehensively evaluate 10 prominent multimodal large language models. Currently, all models struggle, and the best results (Gemini 1.5 Pro) are around 33% accuracy, highlighting the severe deficiency of these techniques in egocentric QA assistance. Our further investigations suggest that precise temporal grounding and multi-frame reasoning, along with high resolution and auxiliary scene-text inputs, are key for better performance. With thorough analyses and heuristic suggestions, we hope EgoTextVQA can serve as a solid testbed for research in egocentric scene-text QA assistance. Our dataset is released at: https://github.com/zhousheng97/EgoTextVQA.",

      "abstract": "Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color, texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules (Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers, implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technique estimates vital signs, such as heart rate (HR), by analyzing subtle skin color variation in facial videos induced by the pulse. However, it remains a critical challenge to robustly acquire cardiac pulse information in scenarios with head motion (e.g., rotation and swing), as it inevitably introduces interfering noise, such as facial geometric deformation and displacement. Most existing methods primarily focus on how to extract subtle pulse signals while neglecting the detrimental effects of noise, especially out-of-distribution motion patterns. In response to this, we propose a temporal gated face alignment network (TGFAN) to adaptively counteract motion noise in long-term video sequences. Specifically, the bidirectional temporal face alignment (BFA) block first captures interframe motion discrepancies to align the displaced face feature and then extracts motion-robust pulse features. Furthermore, we propose a learnable temporal gating mechanism that disentangles the features and dynamically guides motion-disturbed segments for feature alignment, thereby alleviating local head motion interference. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance on both intradataset and cross-dataset tests.",

      "abstract": "3D visual grounding (3DVG), which aims to correlate a natural language description with the target object within a 3D scene, is a significant yet challenging task. Despite recent advancements in this domain, existing approaches commonly encounter a shortage: a limited amount and diversity of text-3D pairs available for training. Moreover, they fall short in effectively leveraging different contextual clues (e.g., rich spatial relations within the 3D visual space) for grounding. To address these limitations, we propose AugRefer, a novel approach for advancing 3D visual grounding. AugRefer introduces cross-modal augmentation designed to extensively generate diverse text-3D pairs by placing objects into 3D scenes and creating accurate and semantically rich descriptions using foundation models. Notably, the resulting pairs can be utilized by any existing 3DVG methods for enriching their training data. Besides, AugRefer presents a language-spatial adaptive decoder that effectively adapts the potential referring objects based on the language description and various 3D spatial relations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of AugRefer.",

      "abstract": "Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its crucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with promising potential for applications in human communication and emotion analysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (PCAN) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. Firstly, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. Secondly, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative (FN) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive (FP) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. Finally, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "The Audio-Visual Video Parsing task aims to recognize and temporally localize all events occurring in either the audio or visual stream, or both. Capturing accurate event semantics for each audio/visual segment is vital. Prior works directly utilize the extracted holistic audio and visual features for intra- and cross-modal temporal interactions. However, each segment may contain multiple events, resulting in semantically mixed holistic features that can lead to semantic interference during intra- or cross-modal interactions: the event semantics of one segment may incorporate semantics of unrelated events from other segments. To address this issue, our method begins with a Class-Aware Feature Decoupling (CAFD) module, which explicitly decouples the semantically mixed features into distinct class-wise features, including multiple event-specific features and a dedicated background feature. The decoupled class-wise features enable our model to selectively aggregate useful semantics for each segment from clearly matched classes contained in other segments, preventing semantic interference from irrelevant classes. Specifically, we further design a Fine-Grained Semantic Enhancement module for encoding intra- and cross-modal relations. It comprises a Segment-wise Event Co-occurrence Modeling (SECM) block and a Local-Global Semantic Fusion (LGSF) block. The SECM exploits inter-class dependencies of concurrent events within the same timestamp with the aid of a novel event co-occurrence loss. The LGSF further enhances the event semantics of each segment by incorporating relevant semantics from more informative global video features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and loss functions, resulting in a new state-of-the-art parsing performance.",

      "abstract": "Answering questions related to audio-visual scenes, i.e., the AVQA task, is becoming increasingly popular. A critical challenge is accurately identifying and tracking sounding objects related to the question along the timeline. In this paper, we present a new Patch-level Sounding Object Tracking (PSOT) method. It begins with a Motion-driven Key Patch Tracking (M-KPT) module, which relies on visual motion information to identify salient visual patches with significant movements that are more likely to relate to sounding objects and questions. We measure the patch-wise motion intensity map between neighboring video frames and utilize it to construct and guide a motion-driven graph network. Meanwhile, we design a Sound-driven KPT (S-KPT) module to explicitly track sounding patches. This module also involves a graph network, with the adjacency matrix regularized by the audio-visual correspondence map. The M-KPT and S-KPT modules are performed in parallel for each temporal segment, allowing balanced tracking of salient and sounding objects. Based on the tracked patches, we further propose a Question-driven KPT (Q-KPT) module to retain patches highly relevant to the question, ensuring the model focuses on the most informative clues. The audio-visual-question features are updated during the processing of these modules, which are then aggregated for final answer prediction. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive performance even compared to recent large-scale pretraining-based approaches.",

      "abstract": "Inspired by the activity-silent and persistent activity mechanisms in human visual perception biology, we design a Unified Static and Dynamic Network (UniSDNet), to learn the semantic association between the video and text/audio queries in a cross-modal environment for efficient video grounding. For static modeling, we devise a novel residual structure (ResMLP) to boost the global comprehensive interaction between the video segments and queries, achieving more effective semantic enhancement/supplement. For dynamic modeling, we effectively exploit three characteristics of the persistent activity mechanism in our network design for a better video context comprehension. Specifically, we construct a diffusely connected video clip graph on the basis of 2D sparse temporal masking to reflect the \"short-term effect\" relationship. We innovatively consider the temporal distance and relevance as the joint \"auxiliary evidence clues\" and design a multi-kernel Temporal Gaussian Filter to expand the context clue into high-dimensional space, simulating the \"complex visual perception\", and then conduct element level filtering convolution operations on neighbour clip nodes in message passing stage for finally generating and ranking the candidate proposals. Our UniSDNet is applicable to both Natural Language Video Grounding (NLVG) and Spoken Language Video Grounding (SLVG) tasks. Our UniSDNet achieves SOTA performance on three widely used datasets for NLVG, as well as three datasets for SLVG, e.g., reporting new records at 38.88% $R@1,IoU@0.7$R@1,IoU@0.7 on ActivityNet Captions and 40.26% $R@1,IoU@0.5$R@1,IoU@0.5 on TACoS. To facilitate this field, we collect two new datasets (Charades-STA Speech and TACoS Speech) for SLVG task. Meanwhile, the inference speed of our UniSDNet is 1.56× faster than the strong multi-query benchmark.",

      "abstract": "Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to generate sign videos corresponding to spoken language sentences, where the conversion of sign Glosses to Poses (G2P) is the key step. Due to the cross-modal semantic gap and the lack of word-action correspondence labels for strong supervision alignment, the SLP suffers huge challenges in linguistics-vision consistency. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based Linguistics-Vision Monotonic Consistent Network (LVMCN) for SLP, which constrains fine-grained cross-modal monotonic alignment and coarse-grained multimodal semantic consistency in language-visual cues through Cross-modal Semantic Aligner (CSA) and Multimodal Semantic Comparator (MSC). In the CSA, we constrain the implicit alignment between corresponding gloss and pose sequences by computing the cosine similarity association matrix between cross-modal feature sequences (i.e., the order consistency of fine-grained sign glosses and actions). As for MSC, we construct multimodal triplets based on paired and unpaired samples in batch data. By pulling closer the corresponding text-visual pairs and pushing apart the non-corresponding text-visual pairs, we constrain the semantic co-occurrence degree between corresponding gloss and pose sequences (i.e., the semantic consistency of coarse-grained textual sentences and sign videos). Extensive experiments on the popular PHOENIX14T benchmark show that the LVMCN outperforms the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "The Audio-visual Classification (AVC) task aims to determine video categories by integrating audio and visual signals. Traditional methods for AVC leverage Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that operate on floating-point features, affording large parameter counts and consuming extensive energy. Recent research has shifted towards brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which transmit audiovisual information through sparser 0/1 spike features allowing for better energy efficiency. However, a byproduct of such sparsity is the increased difficulty in effectively encoding and utilizing these spike features. Moreover, the spike firing characteristics based on neuron membrane potential cause asynchronous spike activations due to the heterogeneous distributions of different modalities in the AVC task, resulting in cross-modal asynchronization. This issue is often overlooked by prior SNN models, resulting in lower classification accuracy compared to traditional ANN models. To address these challenges, we present a new Multimodal Interaction Spiking Network (MISNet), the first to successfully balance both accuracy and efficiency for the AVC task. As the core of MISNet, we propose a Multimodal Leaky Integrate-and-fire (MLIF) neuron, which coordinates and synchronizes the spike activations of audiovisual signals within a single neuron, distinguishing it from the prior paradigm of SNNs that relies on multiple separate processing neurons. As a result, our MISNet enables to generate audio and visual spiking features with effective cross-modal fusion. Additionally, we propose to add extra loss regularizations before fusing the obtained audio-visual features for final classification, thereby benefiting unimodal spiking learning for multimodal interaction. We evaluate our method on five audio-visual datasets, demonstrating advanced performance in both accuracy and energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "The Audio-Visual Video Parsing task aims to recognize events occurring in video segments for each modality. Presently, the excellent performance in handling video parsing is shown by generating pseudo labels at the segment level. However, these approaches still suffer from adequate semantic learning of fine-grained segment features, which can cause errors in the prediction of those ambiguous events and affect the predictions of another modality. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Text-Infused Parsing Network (TIPNet). Specifically, the event text modality, which can offer more precise semantics than the audio and visual modalities, is introduced to enhance the event-related audio/visual segment features by encoding the cross-modal interactions. Furthermore, to obtain more discriminative segment features for each modality, we propose a novel multimodal contrastive loss with a semantic-aware weighting mechanism. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, e.g., image classification. However, most of the existing models depend heavily on annotated data, where label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data negatively impacts the generalization performance of DNNs. To this end, recent advances in learning with noisy labels (LNL) adopt the sample selection strategy that identifies clean samples from the noisy dataset to update DNNs, using semi-supervised learning where rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. However, existing LNL methods often overlook the varying fitting difficulties of different classes, resulting in suboptimal sample selection and confirmation bias, and consequently, the errors accumulate during semi-supervised training. In this article, we propose a novel method, TNCollab, which aims at alleviating confirmation bias in both sample selection and semi-supervised training stages via two-network collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a class-adaptive threshold for sample selection to address the varying fitting difficulties across different classes. Additionally, we construct a hard set consisting of samples where the two networks disagree and introduce a noise-robust loss to extract potentially useful information while maintaining robustness against label noise. Furthermore, we propose a dual consistency loss to ensure consistent predictions between the networks across different augmented views of the same sample, facilitating mutual learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TNCollab achieves state-of-the-art performance on image classification and facial expression recognition tasks, particularly on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, WebVision, Clothing1M, Tiny-ImageNet, and RAF-DB datasets, showing improved visual understanding and generalization capabilities.

      "abstract": "Vision-based depression estimation is an emerging yet impactful task, whose challenge lies in predicting the severity of depression from facial videos lasting at least several minutes. Existing methods primarily focus on fusing frame-level features to create comprehensive representations. However, they often overlook two crucial aspects: 1) inter- and intra-cue correlations, and 2) variations among samples. Hence, simply characterizing sample embeddings while ignoring to mine the relation among multiple cues leads to limitations. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Cue Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework to mine the relation among multiple cues for discriminative representation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel cross-characteristic attentive interaction module to model the relationship among multiple cues from four facial features (e.g., 3D landmarks, head poses, gazes, FAUs). Then, we propose a temporal segment attentive interaction module to capture the temporal relationships within each facial feature over time intervals. Moreover, we integrate contrastive learning to leverage the variations among samples by regarding the embeddings of inter-cue and intra-cue as positive pairs while considering embeddings from other samples as negative. In this way, the proposed MCCL framework leverages the relationships among the facial features and the variations among samples to enhance the process of multi-cue mining, thereby achieving more accurate facial depression estimation. Extensive experiments on public datasets, DAIC-WOZ, CMDC, and E-DAIC, demonstrate that our model not only outperforms the advanced depression methods but that the discriminative representations of facial behaviors provide potential insights about depression.

      "abstract": "Repetitive Action Counting (RAC) is a critical and challenging task in video analysis, aiming to count the number of repeated actions in videos accurately. Existing methods typically generate a Temporal Self-similarity Matrix (TSM) as an intermediate representation to predict the number of repetitive actions. While this simplifies the process, it often overlooks the variable lengths between action cycles and the phenomenon of motion interruptions. The period inconsistency problem caused by the change in the action period and the motion interruption problem resulting from the motion pause are the two main challenges that affect the accuracy of RAC in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework. First, we construct a boundary-aware encoder equipped with a temporal pyramid structure to build multi-scale video features, capturing the period information of different lengths of repetitive actions to solve the period inconsistency problem. Next, a cycle and boundary attention module is followed by each layer in the pyramid to enhance these multi-scale features with periodic and event boundary information. Finally, we design a gated density estimator to generate the actionness score for each frame that reflects the probability of the corresponding time point being within the motion cycle. These scores are used to weight features to reduce the impact of noise frames without actions present and solve the motion interruption problem for better density prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The source code will be available at https://github.com/zqzhang2023/TBANRAC .",

Human body language understanding has emerged as a critical research area, addressing challenges in analyzing, recognizing, and synthesizing multimodal human behavioral data such as gestures, poses, facial expressions. This Special Issue highlights recent advancements in deep learning techniques that enhance the robustness, scalability, and applicability of human body language understanding in diverse scenarios, including healthcare, education, and barrier-free human-computer interaction systems. The issue features a total of eight research articles focusing on key aspects of human body language understanding. These contributions are categorized into major research areas: gesture and sign language understanding, pose and action recognition, and facial expression and emotion analysis. Each article provides novel insights into challenges such as data scarcity, multimodal integration, adversarial robustness, and cross-modal generative modeling. We summarize the main contributions of the included works and emphasize their role in advancing the field of human body language understanding. Finally, we discuss ongoing challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly evolving domain, particularly in the context of integrating human-centric AI systems into real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "Partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task in text-to-video retrieval, where videos are untrimmed and contain much background content. The pursuit here is of both effective and efficient solutions to capture the partial correspondence between text queries and untrimmed videos. Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling multi-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and information redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment discovering (AMDNet). We are committed to discovering video moments that are semantically consistent with their queries. By using learnable span anchors to capture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to emphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve more compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment modeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments of distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically query-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval loss for end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, TVR and ActivityNet Captions) demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our AMDNet. In particular, AMDNet is about 15.5 times smaller (#parameters) while 6.0 points higher (SumR) than the up-to-date method GMMFormer on TVR.",

      "abstract": "Repetitive Action Counting (RAC) aims to count the number of repetitive actions occurring in videos. In the real world, repetitive actions have great diversity and bring numerous challenges (e.g., viewpoint changes, non-uniform periods, and action interruptions). Existing methods based on the temporal self-similarity matrix (TSSM) for RAC are trapped in the bottleneck of insufficient capturing action periods when applied to complicated daily videos. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method named Hybrid Temporal Relation Modeling Network (HTRM-Net) to build diverse TSSM for RAC. The HTRM-Net mainly consists of three key components: bi-modal temporal self-similarity matrix modeling, random matrix dropping, and local temporal context modeling. Specifically, we construct temporal self-similarity matrices by bi-modal (self-attention and dual-softmax) operations, yielding diverse matrix representations from the combination of row-wise and column-wise correlations. To further enhance matrix representations, we propose incorporating a random matrix dropping module to guide channel-wise learning of the matrix explicitly. After that, we inject the local temporal context of video frames and the learned matrix into temporal correlation modeling, which can make the model robust enough to cope with error-prone situations, such as action interruption. Finally, a multi-scale matrix fusion module is designed to aggregate temporal correlations adaptively in multi-scale matrices. Extensive experiments across intra- and cross-datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and but also exhibits robust capabilities in accurately counting repetitive actions in unseen action categories. Notably, our method surpasses the classical TransRAC method by 20.04% in MAE and 22.76% in OBO.",

This paper proposes a diagonal distance loss function, , and a combined diagonal distance loss function, , based IoU. These functions use the distance between diagonals as a penalty, overcoming the degradation phenomenon of prior functions based on traditional IoU. The altered loss functions are also integrated into faster R‐CNN and SSD models, and their effectiveness is assessed on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO and SSDD data sets, yielding favourable results. This paper also extends the IoU calculation between two boxes when performing non‐maximum suppression to advance position precision. The experiments have demonstrated that the enhanced distance calculation method improves both loss function and non‐maximum suppression calculations by around .",

      "abstract": "Complex action recognition aims to identify multiple actions over a long time. Multiple actions may occur at the same time (defined as simultaneous actions), and may occur after each other (defined as each action) Complex action recognition may suffer from two challenges. (1) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Temporal repeated bias.</i> The same action may repeat in a temporal duration. In this duration, the prediction may be biased to the majority of actions, which occur repeatedly in the past temporal frames. (2) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Epistemic uncertainty of multiple actions.</i> When there are multiple simultaneous actions in one frame, this frame's feature may result in the distribution of multiple actions overlapping each other. Without modeling proper relations between actions, the model may hinder accurately explaining certain categories in multiple actions (defined as the model's epistemic uncertainty). In this work, we propose an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Instructive Probabilistic Transformer</i>, which contains a probabilistic temporal memorizer, and a probabilistic prototype Transformer. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">First</i>, to alleviate temporal repeated bias, we design a probabilistic temporal memory module, which learns probabilistic temporal gates to localize each action. The probabilistic gates instruct the selective memory of each action in long-term frames. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Second</i>, we cluster features to capture common action semantics among features (defined as action prototypes). To alleviate the epistemic uncertainty of multiple actions, we design a probabilistic prototype Transformer module. This module learns probabilistic relations depending on each prototype, which can ensure the separation between different prototypes. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third</i>, to ensure the proper probabilistic relations depending on each prototype, we extend action loss with distribution loss to learn uncertainty-aware action loss. In uncertainty-aware action loss, the distribution loss measures the consistency between probabilistic relations and prototype relation distribution. The prediction uncertainty is learned by analyzing the entropy of multiple predictions, and helps to ensure the effect between action loss and distribution loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Charades, Breakfast Actions, and MultiTHUMOS.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modality image fusion aims to synthesize a single, comprehensive image from multiple source inputs. Traditional approaches, such as CNNs and GANs, offer efficiency but struggle to handle low-quality or complex inputs. Recent advances in text-guided methods leverage large model priors to overcome these limitations, but at the cost of significant computational overhead, both in memory and inference time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for distilling large model priors, eliminating the need for text guidance during inference while dramatically reducing model size. Our framework utilizes a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher network incorporates large model priors and transfers this knowledge to a smaller student network via a tailored distillation process. Crucially, our experiments demonstrate that this knowledge transfer is the primary driver of performance gains, rather than mere architectural optimization. Additionally, we introduce a spatial-channel cross-fusion module to enhance the model’s ability to leverage textual priors across both spatial and channel dimensions. Our method achieves a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and fusion quality. The distilled network, requiring only 10% of the parameters and inference time of the teacher network, retains 90% of its performance and outperforms existing SOTA methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Codes are available at https://github.com/Zirconium233/DTPF.",

      "abstract": "Weakly supervised video anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal snippets in untrimmed videos. Existing methods learn prototypes to describe global representation of snippet distributions. But, in weakly-labeled videos, the normal snippets in abnormal video may take high-uncertainty labels for distribution modeling. Without confidence-aware modeling, abnormal/normal prototype distributions may overlap with each other, leading to inaccurate predictions. In this work, we propose the Unified Confident Prototype (UCP) model, which contains a feature extractor, a confidence-aware prototype learner, and a local-global prototype unifier. The prototype learning is designed to ensure proper separability, stability, and representation. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">First</i>, after learning the weight of each snippet’s loss, snippets with high-uncertainty labels may take small weights. These snippets tend to lie in the overlap between abnormal/normal distributions, hindering their separation. We design uncertainty-aware sampling, which removes high-uncertainty snippets in the small-weight snippets to ensure separable prototype learning. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Second</i>, snippets with high-uncertainty labels tend to be far from the prototype center, thus falling in the low-confidence region. These snippets may enlarge the distribution’s variation, resulting in unstable prototype learning. We design confidence-aware sampling, which removes low-confidence snippets to ensure stable prototype learning. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third</i>, after assigning pseudo labels to prototypes, we measure the prototype representation with the distribution’s purity. We design prototype distribution purification, which penalizes normal snippets in the abnormal-majority distribution with purity loss to ensure representative prototype learning. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Fourth</i>, beyond prototype learning, prototypes can be enhanced by local/global temporal semantics. We further introduce the local-global prototype unifier to learn the relations across local-global durations, thereby enhancing the semantics for anomaly detection. For weakly-supervised anomaly detection, experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets. Moreover, to further verify the generality of our method, we further conduct experiments on THUMOS’14 for weakly-supervised temporal action localization.",

      "abstract": "Existing efforts in text-based video question answering (TextVideoQA) are criticized for their opaque decision-making and heavy reliance on scene-text recognition. In this paper, we propose to study <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Grounded TextVideoQA</i> by forcing models to answer questions and spatio-temporally localize the relevant scene-text regions, thus decoupling QA from scene-text recognition and promoting research towards interpretable QA. The task has three-fold significance. First, it encourages scene-text evidence versus other short-cuts for answer predictions. Second, it directly accepts scene-text regions as visual answers, thus circumventing the problem of ineffective answer evaluation by stringent string matching. Third, it isolates the challenges inherited in VideoQA and scene-text recognition. This enables the diagnosis of the root causes for failure predictions, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</i>.<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</i>., wrong QA or wrong scene-text recognition? To achieve Grounded TextVideoQA, we propose the T2S-QA model that highlights a disentangled temporal-to-spatial contrastive learning strategy for weakly-supervised scene-text grounding and grounded TextVideoQA. To facilitate evaluation, we construct a new dataset <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ViTXT-GQA</i> which features 52<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</b> scene-text bounding boxes within 2.2<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</b> temporal segments related to 2<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</b> questions and 729 videos. With ViTXT-GQA, we perform extensive experiments and demonstrate the severe limitations of existing techniques in Grounded TextVideoQA. While T2S-QA achieves superior results, the large performance gap with human leaves ample space for improvement.

In 1S1T scenarios, active domain adaptation methods improve generalization by incorporating a few target domain samples, but these methods are rarely applied in 1SmT due to potential sampling bias and outlier interference. To address this, we propose Progressive Prototype Refinement (PPR), an active multi-target domain adaptation method combining 1SmT with active learning to enhance cross-domain knowledge transfer. Specifically, an uncertainty assessment strategy is used to select representative samples from multiple target domains, forming a candidate set for model training. Based on the Lindeberg--Levy central limit theorem, we sample from a Gaussian distribution using corrected prototype statistics to augment the classifier's feature input, allowing the model to learn transitional information between domains. Finally, a mapping matrix is used for cross-domain alignment, addressing incomplete class coverage and outlier interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate PPR's superior performance, with a 6.35% improvement on the PACS dataset and a 17.32% improvement on the Remote Sensing dataset.",

      "abstract": "Quantization is one of the efficient model compression methods, which represents the network with fixed-point or low-bit numbers. Existing quantization methods address the network quantization by treating it as a single-objective optimization that pursues high accuracy (performance optimization) while keeping the quantization constraint. However, owing to the non-differentiability of the quantization operation, it is challenging to integrate the quantization operation into the network training and achieve optimal parameters. In this paper, a novel multi-objective convex quantization for efficient model compression is proposed. Specifically, the network training is modeled as a multi-objective optimization to find the network with both high precision and low quantization error (actually, these two goals are somewhat contradictory and affect each other). To achieve effective multi-objective optimization, this paper designs a quantization error function that is differentiable and ensures the computation convexity in each period, so as to avoid the non-differentiable back-propagation of the quantization operation. Then, we perform a time-series self-distillation training scheme on the multi-objective optimization framework, which distills its past softened labels and combines the hard targets to guarantee controllable and stable performance convergence during training. At last and more importantly, a new dynamic Lagrangian coefficient adaption is designed to adjust the gradient magnitude of quantization loss and performance loss and balance the two losses during training processing. The proposed method is evaluated on well-known benchmarks: MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and Microsoft COCO, and experimental results show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance compared to existing methods.",

      "abstract": "Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities, e.g. generating unseen, but natural data. However, the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard' does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness. Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.",

      "abstract": "Mental health has attracted substantial attention in recent years and large language model (LLM) can be an effective technology for alleviating this problem owing to its capability in text understanding and dialogue. However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this article, we propose a specialized psychological LLM, named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multiturn dialogues, and knowledge-based QA. Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multiturn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared with other LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Representation learning and feature disentanglement have garnered significant research interest in the field of facial expression recognition (FER). The inherent ambiguity of emotion labels poses challenges for conventional supervised representation learning methods. Moreover, directly learning the mapping from a facial expression image to an emotion label lacks explicit supervision signals for capturing fine-grained facial features. In this article, we propose a novel FER model, named poker face vision transformer or PF-ViT, to address these challenges. PF-ViT aims to separate and recognize the disturbance-agnostic emotion from a static facial image by generating its corresponding poker face without the need for paired images. Inspired by the facial action coding system, we regard an expressive face as the combined result of a set of facial muscle movements on one's poker face (i.e., an emotionless face). PF-ViT utilizes vanilla vision transformers, and its components are first pretrained as masked autoencoders on a large facial expression dataset without emotion labels, yielding excellent representations. Subsequently, we train PF-ViT using a GAN framework. During training, the auxiliary task of poke face generation promotes the disentanglement between emotional and emotion-irrelevant components, guiding the FER model to holistically capture discriminative facial details. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods on four popular FER datasets.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement aims to estimate physiological signals by analyzing subtle skin color changes induced by heartbeats in facial videos. Existing methods primarily rely on the fundamental video frame features or vanilla facial ROI (region of interest) features. Recognizing the varying light absorption and reactions of different facial regions over time, we adopt a new perspective to conduct a more fine-grained exploration of the key clues present in different facial regions within each frame and across temporal frames. Concretely, we propose a novel clustering-driven remote physiological measurement framework called Cluster-Phys, which employs a facial ROI prototypical clustering module to adaptively cluster the representative facial ROI features as facial prototypes and then update facial prototypes with highly semantic correlated base ROI features. In this way, our approach can mine facial clues from a more compact and informative prototype level rather than the conventional video/ROI level. Furthermore, we also propose a spatial-temporal prototype interaction module to learn facial prototype correlation from both spatial (across prototypes) and temporal (within prototype) perspectives. Extensive experiments are conducted on both intra-dataset and cross-dataset tests. The results show that our Cluster-Phys achieves significant performance improvement with less computation consumption. The source code will be available at https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/ClusterPhys.",

In recent years, a growing trend towards deeper understanding of human emotional states has led to a gradual shift in the attention of multimedia and computer vision researchers from macro facial expressions to whole-body micro-actions. Micro-actions are spontaneous body movements that indicate a person's true feelings and potential intentions. Yet, recognizing, distinguishing, and understanding micro-actions is challenging because they are subtle compared to normal actions. This grand challenge aims to foster innovative research in micro-action analysis and provide benchmark evaluations to advance the technology in the human-centric action understanding community.",

      "abstract": "Video Moment Retrieval (MR) tasks involve predicting the moment described by a given natural language or spoken language query in an untrimmed video. In this paper, we propose a novel Maskable Retentive Network (MRNet) to address two key challenges in MR tasks: cross-modal guidance and video sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a new retention mechanism into the multimodal Transformer architecture, incorporating modality-specific attention modes. Specifically, we employ the Unlimited Attention for language-related attention regions to maximize cross-modal mutual guidance. Then, we introduce the Maskable Retention for video-only attention region to enhance video sequence modeling, that is, recognizing two crucial characteristics of video sequences: 1) bidirectional, decaying, and non-linear temporal associations between video clips, and 2) sparse associations of key information semantically related to the query. We propose a bidirectional decay retention mask to explicitly model temporal-distant context dependencies of video sequences, along with a learnable sparse retention mask to adaptively capture strong associations relevant to the target event. Extensive experiments conducted on five popular benchmarks ActivityNet Captions, TACoS, Charades-STA, ActivityNet Speech, and QVHighlights for MR tasks demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by our method over existing approaches.

      "abstract": "Compared to traditional technology, image classification technology possesses a superior capability for quantitative analysis of the target and background, and holds significant applications in the domains of ground target reconnaissance, marine environment monitoring, and emergency response to sudden natural disasters, among others. Currently, the enhancement of spatial spectral resolution heightens the difficulty and reduces the efficiency of classification, posing a substantial challenge to the aforementioned applications. Hence, the classification algorithm is required to take both computing power and classification accuracy into account. Research indicates that the deep kernel mapping network can accommodate both computing power and classification accuracy. By employing the kernel mapping function as the network node function of deep learning, it effectively enhances the classification accuracy under the condition of limited computing power. Therefore, to address the issue of network structure optimization of deep mapping networks and the insufficient application of line feature learning and expression in existing network structures, considering the adaptive optimization of network structures, deep quasiconformal kernel network learning (DQKNet) is proposed for image classification. Firstly, the structural parameters and learning parameters of the deep kernel mapping network are optimized. This approach can adaptively adjust the network structure based on the distribution characteristics of the data and enhance the performance of image classification. Secondly, the computational network node optimization method of quasiconformal kernel learning is applied to this network, further elevating the performance of the deep kernel learning mapping network in image classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in the deep kernel mapping network from the perspectives of accounting children, mapping network nodes, and network structure can effectively enhance the feature extraction and classification performance of the data. On the five public datasets, the average AA, OA, and KC values of our algorithm are 91.99, 91.25, and 85.99, respectively, outperforming the currently most-advanced algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Attention-Enhanced Multimodal Temporal Network (AMTN) to address the MuSe 2024 Cross-Cultural Humor Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humor), which highlights the task of humor detection within a cross-cultural context, leveraging multimodal information for its accomplishment. Specifically, we employ the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture the temporal dynamics within individual modalities' features. Following this, we apply attention mechanism to refine the integration of information across different modalities and temporal sequences. The integrated features are then used for humor detection. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of an end-to-end approach for this challenge. Finally, a more robust outcome is achieved by aggregating multiple experimental results, which constitutes our final submission for the challenge. As a result, our solution achieves a remarkable AUC score of 0.8833 on the test dataset, outperforming the baseline by 0.0151 and securing 2nd place in the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge.",

      "abstract": "In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model (DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using AVSD@DSTC-7 and AVSD@DSTC-8 datasets underscore the superiority of our methodology.",

However, discrepancies in the modeling process and simplifications of the electromagnetic characteristics inevitably cause some differences between synthetic and mea-sured images.

This paper quantitatively discusses the effects of different augmentation methods and provides recommendations for SAR image augmentation.",

      "abstract": "Gaze following aims to predict where a person is looking in a scene. Existing methods tend to prioritize traditional 2D RGB visual cues or require burdensome prior knowledge and extra expensive datasets annotated in 3D coordinate systems to train specialized modules to enhance scene modeling. In this work, we introduce a novel framework deployed on a simple ResNet backbone, which exclusively uses image and depth maps to mimic human visual preferences and realize 3D-like depth perception. We first leverage depth maps to formulate spatial-based proximity information regarding the objects with the target person. This process sharpens the focus of the gaze cone on the specific region of interest pertaining to the target while diminishing the impact of surrounding distractions. To capture the diverse dependence of scene context on the saliency gaze cone, we then introduce a learnable grid-level regularized attention that anticipates coarse-grained regions of interest, thereby refining the mapping of the saliency feature to pixel-level heatmaps. This allows our model to better account for individual differences when predicting others’ gaze locations. Finally, we employ the KL-divergence loss to super the grid-level regularized attention, which combines the gaze direction, heatmap regression, and in/out classification losses, providing comprehensive supervision for model optimization. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of our model with less help of modal information. Quantitative visualization results further validate the interpretability of our method. The source code will be available at https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/DepthMatters .",

Bearing defects significantly impact the performance and lifespan of motors, and traditional manual inspection methods suffer from low efficiency and high miss rates. This paper proposes the use of machine vision and image processing techniques to enhance the speed, efficiency, and reliability of detection. The study includes the analysis of common defect types on bearing end faces, the selection of industrial cameras and vision lighting, as well as image preprocessing and edge detection. By improving the YOLOv5 algorithm, the detection performance for small and medium-sized targets on bearing end faces is optimized. Moreover, a supervisory software for bearing defect detection has been designed to achieve more effective processing and statistical analysis of detection results. The primary goal of the research is to enhance the accuracy and automation level of detection, reduce the risk of omissions in manual inspections, and improve detection efficiency through the advancement of deep learning-based target detection algorithms. This research holds significant importance for the technological progress and production efficiency improvement in the small motor bearing industry.",

      "abstract": "This study delves into the task of automated flute music composition by leveraging deep learning methods to automatically generate flute music with single and multiple tracks. To enhance musical complexity and diversity, we propose a new music generation model called Style-Atten GAN, with the integration of a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, self-attention mechanism, and stylistic characteristics of the flute. This directs the music generative process to focus on critical musical elements and structures in typical flute audios, thereby fostering the production of compositions that are not only novel, but also rich in musicality and expressiveness. Through a comparative experiment and analysis, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed Style-Atten GAN model against recent music composition methods of the same type. Quantitative and qualitative analytical indicators highlight the superiority of the proposed neural network approach in producing stylistically diverse and creatively rich flute music. The findings reveal that GAN models, when augmented with the attention mechanism and unique stylized characteristics of the flute instrument, can outperform conventional methods in terms of fidelity, adherence to musical aesthetics, and the ability to capture the nuanced expressiveness of flute music.",

      "abstract": "Multimedia-based recommendation (MMRec) models typically rely on observed user-item interactions and the multimodal content of items, such as visual images and textual descriptions, to predict user preferences. Among these, the user's preference for the displayed multimodal content of items is crucial for interacting with a particular item. We argue that users' preference behaviors (i.e., user-item interactions) for the modality content of items, beyond stemming from their real interest in the modality content, may also be influenced by their conformity to the popularity of items' modality-specific content (e.g., a user might be motivated to interact with a lipstick due to enthusiastic discussions among other users regarding textual reviews of the product). In essence, user-item interactions are jointly triggered by real interest and conformity. However, most existing MMRec models primarily concentrate on modeling users' interest preferences when capturing multimodal user preferences, neglecting the modeling of their conformity preferences, which results in sub-optimal recommendation performance. In this work, we resort to causal theory to propose a novel MMRec model, termed Multimodal Graph Causal Embedding (MGCE), revealing insights into the crucial causal relations of users' modality-specific interest and conformity in interaction behaviors within MMRec scenarios. Inspired by the colliding effect in causal inference and integrating the characteristics of real interest and conformity, we devise multimodal causal embedding learning networks to facilitate the learning of high-quality causal embeddings (multimodal interest and multimodal conformity embeddings) from both the structure-level and feature-level, yielding state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MGCE.",

      "abstract": "Video Motion Magnification (VMM) aims to reveal subtle and imperceptible motion information of objects in the macroscopic world. Prior methods directly model the motion field from the Eulerian perspective by Representation Learning that separates shape and texture or Multi-domain Learning from phase fluctuations. Inspired by the frequency spectrum, we observe that the low-frequency components with stable energy always possess spatial structure and less noise, making them suitable for modeling the subtle motion field. To this end, we present FD4MM, a new paradigm of Frequency Decoupling for Motion Magnification with a Multi-level Isomorphic Architecture to capture multi-level high-frequency details and a stable low-frequency structure (motion field) in video space. Since high-frequency details and subtle motions are susceptible to information degra-dation due to their inherent subtlety and unavoidable ex-ternal interference from noise, we carefully design Sparse High/Low-pass Filters to enhance the integrity of details and motion structures, and a Sparse Frequency Mixer to promote seamless recoupling. Besides, we innovatively design a contrastive regularization for this task to strengthen the model's ability to discriminate irrelevant features, re-ducing undesired motion magnification. Extensive experiments on both Real-world and Synthetic Datasets show that our FD4MM outperforms SOTA methods. Meanwhile, FD4MM reduces FLOPs by 1.63x and boosts inference speed by 1.68x than the latest method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jiafei127/FD4MM.",

      "abstract": "Quantization for model compression can efficiently re-duce the network complexity and storage requirement, but the original training data is necessary to remedy the performance loss caused by quantization. The Data-Free Quan-tization (DFQ) methods have been proposed to handle the absence of original training data with synthetic data. How-ever, there are differences between the synthetic and orig-inal training data, which affects the performance of the quantized network, but none of the existing methods con-siders the differences. In this paper, we propose an efficient data-free quantization via pseudo-label filtering, which is the first to evaluate the synthetic data before quantization. We design a new metric for evaluating synthetic data using self-entropy, which indicates the reliability of synthetic data. The synthetic data can be categorized with the met-ric into high- and low-reliable datasets for the following training process. Besides, the multiple pseudo-labels are designed to label the synthetic data with different reliabil-ity, which can provide valuable supervision information and avoid misleading training by low-reliable samples. Exten-sive experiments are implemented on several datasets, in-cluding CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with various models. The experimental results show that our method can perform excellently and outperform existing methods in ac-curacy.",

We propose a two-stage deep learning framework for this task. In the first stage, we preprocess the provided dataset by concatenating images into video sequences. Subsequently, we leverage a low-rank video deraining method to generate high-fidelity pseudo ground truths. These pseudo ground truths offer superior alignment compared to the original ground truths, facilitating model convergence during training. In the second stage, we employ the InternImage network to train for the semantic segmentation task using the generated pseudo ground truths. Notably, our meticulously designed framework demonstrates robustness to degraded data captured under adverse weather conditions. In the challenge, our solution achieved a competitive score of 0.43 on the Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric, securing a respectable rank of 4th.",

      "abstract": "In order to achieve sensorless control across the entire speed range of an Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM), a sensorless control method for low-to-high-speed switching in an IPMSM is proposed. First, a mathematical reference model of the IPMSM is established. Then, the transition region from low to high speed is then determined by measuring the rotor speed. Based on this,the zero to low speed range uses pulse high-frequency injection(HFI) signals, while the sliding mode observer(SMO) method is used in the medium to high speed range. This enables the estimation of motor speed and position of the rotor in the zero to low speed and medium-high-speed domains, respectively. Improving upon traditional weighted switching methods, a variable weighting coefficient method is adopted. An objective function is formulated, and the optimal weighting coefficients are determined using the Sparrow Search Algorithm(SSA). This ensures smooth transition within the switching region, ultimately achieving sensorless control of the IPMSM across the entire speed range. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed sensorless control method's reliability and stability, with smoother low-to-high-speed transitions and more accurate estimation precision.",

      "abstract": "Traditional video captioning tasks often suffer from uncontrollable syntax, limiting their adaptability to diverse practical requirements. This paper explores a challenging task known as syntax-controllable video captioning (SCVC). Specifically, this task aims to generate captions for videos that convey the visual content accurately and adhere to the syntactic structure provided in an example sentence. To tackle the SCVC task, we propose a novel Tree-Structural Syntax Augmentation Network (TSAN). It consists of a tree-structural syntax encoder to capture syntactic parent-child relationships of example sentences and a syntax-customized caption generator to integrate syntax and semantic hints effectively. Moreover, we introduce a syntax-semantic joint optimization strategy that considers both syntax and semantic constraints for joint training. Considering the fact that there are no available syntax-controllable video caption datasets, we use the traditional video captioning dataset to train the model. In the inference process, the model generates syntax-controllable captions in a zero-shot manner, applying exemplar sentences randomly selected from an open corpus and unseen in the training data. The experiments on MSRVTT and VATEX datasets validate the superior performance of TSAN in both semantic and syntactic evaluations. Extensive ablation studies and visualizations further show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Weakly supervised temporal action localization (TAL) aims to localize the action instances in untrimmed videos using only video-level action labels. Without snippet-level labels, this task should be hard to distinguish all snippets with accurate action/background categories. The main difficulties are the large variations brought by the unconstraint background snippets and multiple subactions in action snippets. The existing prototype model focuses on describing snippets by covering them with clusters (defined as prototypes). In this work, we argue that the clustered prototype covering snippets with simple variations still suffers from the misclassification of the snippets with large variations. We propose an ensemble prototype network (EPNet), which ensembles prototypes learned with consensus-aware clustering. The network stacks a consensus prototype learning (CPL) module and an ensemble snippet weight learning (ESWL) module as one stage and extends one stage to multiple stages in an ensemble learning way. The CPL module learns the consensus matrix by estimating the similarity of clustering labels between two successive clustering generations. The consensus matrix optimizes the clustering to learn consensus prototypes, which can predict the snippets with consensus labels. The ESWL module estimates the weights of the misclassified snippets using the snippet-level loss. The weights update the posterior probabilities of the snippets in the clustering to learn prototypes in the next stage. We use multiple stages to learn multiple prototypes, which can cover the snippets with large variations for accurate snippet classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art weakly supervised TAL methods on two benchmark datasets, that is, THUMOS'14, ActivityNet v1.2, and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task that aims to answer questions derived from untrimmed audible videos. To generate accurate answers, an AVQA model is expected to find the most informative audio-visual clues relevant to the given questions. In this paper, we propose to explicitly consider fine-grained visual objects in video frames (object-level clues) and explore the multi-modal relations (\\textit{i.e.}, the object, audio, and question) in terms of feature interaction and model optimization. For the former, we present an end-to-end object-oriented network that adopts a question-conditioned clue discovery module to concentrate audio/visual modalities on respective keywords of the question and designs a modality-conditioned clue collection module to highlight closely associated audio segments or visual objects. For model optimization, we propose an object-aware adaptive-positivity learning strategy that selects the highly semantic-matched multi-modal pair as \\textit{positivity}. Specifically, we design two object-aware contrastive loss functions to identify the highly relevant question-object pairs and audio-object pairs, respectively. These selected pairs are constrained to have larger similarity values than the mismatched pairs. The positivity-selecting process is adaptive as the positivity pairs selected in each video frame may be different. These two object-aware objectives help the model understand \\textit{which objects are exactly relevant to the question} and \\textit{which are making sounds}. Extensive experiments on the MUSIC-AVQA dataset demonstrate the proposed method is effective in finding favorable audio-visual clues and also achieves new state-of-the-art question-answering performance.

      "abstract": "Action anticipation aims to infer the action in the unobserved segment (future segment) with the observed segment (past segment). Existing methods focus on learning key past semantics to predict the future, but they do not model the temporal continuity between the past and the future. However, past actions are always highly uncertain in anticipating the unobserved future. The absence of temporal continuity smoothing in the video's past-and-future segments may result in an inconsistent anticipation of future action. In this work, we aim to smooth the global semantics changes in the past and future segments. We propose a Consistency-guided Probabilistic Model (CPM), which focuses on learning the globally temporal probabilistic consistency to inhibit the unexpected temporal consistency. The CPM is deployed on the Transformer architecture, which includes three modules of future semantics estimation, global semantics estimation, and global distribution estimation involving the learning of past-to-future semantics, past-and-future semantics, and semantically probabilistic distributions. To achieve the smoothness of temporal continuity, we follow the principle of variational analysis and describe two probabilistic distributions, i.e., a past-aware distribution and a global-aware distribution, which help to estimate the evidence lower bound of future anticipation. In this study, we maximize the evidence lower bound of future semantics by reducing the distribution distance between the above two distributions for model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of our method and the CPM achieves state-of-the-art performance on Epic-Kitchen100, Epic-Kitchen55, and EGTEA-GAZE.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)-based physiological measurement is an emerging yet crucial vision task, whose challenge lies in exploring accurate rPPG prediction from facial videos accompanied by noises of illumination variations, facial occlusions, head movements, etc., in a noncontact manner. Existing mainstream convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models make efforts to detect physiological signals by capturing subtle color changes in facial regions of interest (ROI) caused by heartbeats. However, such models are constrained by the limited local spatial or temporal receptive fields in the neural units. Unlike them, a native transformer-based framework called dual-path TokenLearner (dual-TL) is proposed in this article, which utilizes the concept of learnable tokens to integrate both spatial and temporal informative contexts from the global perspective of the video. Specifically, the proposed dual-TL uses a spatial TokenLearner (S-TL) to explore associations in different facial ROIs, which promises the rPPG prediction far away from noisy ROI disturbances. Complementarily, a temporal TokenLearner (T-TL) is designed to infer the quasi-periodic pattern of heartbeats, which eliminates temporal disturbances such as head movements. The two TokenLearners, S-TL and T-TL, are executed in a dual-path mode. This enables the model to reduce noise disturbances for final rPPG signal prediction. Extensive experiments on four physiological measurement benchmark datasets are conducted. The dual-TL achieves state-of-the-art performances in both intra and cross-dataset testings, demonstrating its immense potential as a basic backbone for rPPG measurement.",

      "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has achieved great success in self-supervised representation learning throughout positive and negative pairs based on graph neural networks (GNNs), where one critical issue lies in how to handle the false hard negatives that share the large similarity to the same referenced class as the anchor, which is critical to message passing of GNNs to exploit the graph structure. However, the existing arts either mistakenly identify or miss the false hard negatives, hence resulting into poor node representation. Building on this, there are several crucial bottlenecks — <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Where do false hard negatives exist upon the anchor? How to well seek false hard negatives? Whether are more false hard negatives better?</i> To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a novel Locally Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning method, named LocWGCL, while revealing that false hard negatives are primarily distributed in the first-order and second-order neighborhoods of the anchor. Benefiting from the tightness between the first-order nodes and the anchor, representation similarity is calculated to select false hard negatives. For the second-order case, false hard negatives are identified, such that they share the similar passed message with the anchor over the common first-order nodes, along with the large similarity. Upon the seeking process, we devise a weighted strategy to false hard negatives for better node representation. Empirical studies verify the advantages of LocWGCL over the state-of-the-arts on six benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Micro-action is an imperceptible non-verbal behaviour characterised by low-intensity movement. It offers insights into the feelings and intentions of individuals and is important for human-oriented applications such as emotion recognition and psychological assessment. However, the identification, differentiation, and understanding of micro-actions pose challenges due to the imperceptible and inaccessible nature of these subtle human behaviors in everyday life. In this study, we innovatively collect a new micro-action dataset designated as Micro-action-52 (MA-52), and propose a benchmark named micro-action network (MANet) for micro-action recognition (MAR) task. Uniquely, MA-52 provides the whole-body perspective including gestures, upper- and lower-limb movements, attempting to reveal comprehensive micro-action cues. In detail, MA-52 contains 52 micro-action categories along with seven body part labels, and encompasses a full array of realistic and natural micro-actions, accounting for 205 participants and 22,422 video instances collated from the psychological interviews. Based on the proposed dataset, we assess MANet and other nine prevalent action recognition methods. MANet incorporates squeeze-and excitation (SE) and temporal shift module (TSM) into the ResNet architecture for modeling the spatiotemporal characteristics of micro-actions. Then a joint-embedding loss is designed for semantic matching between video and action labels; the loss is used to better distinguish between visually similar yet distinct micro-action categories. The extended application in emotion recognition has demonstrated one of the important values of our proposed dataset and method. In the future, further exploration of human behaviour, emotion, and psychological assessment will be conducted in depth. The dataset and source code are released at https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Dexmedetomidine has arousal sedation and analgesic effects. This study is to investigate the effect of 0.5µg/kg epidural dexmedetomidine combined with epidural anesthesia (EA) in parturients undergoing cesarean section. Methods A total of 92 parturients were randomly divided into Group R (receiveing epidural ropivacaine alone) Group RD (receiveing epidural ropivacaine with 0.5µg/kg dexmedetomidine). The primary outcome and second outcome will be intraoperative NRS pain scores and Ramsay Sedation Scale. Results All 92 parturients were included in the analysis. The NRS were significantly lower in Group RD compared to Group R at all observation timepoint (P &gt; 0.05). Higher Ramsay Sedation Scale was found in Group RD compared to Group R (P &lt; 0.001). No parturient has experienced sedation score of 4 and above. No significant difference regarding the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia and nausea or vomiting, Apgar scores and the overall satisfaction with anesthesia was found between Group R and Group RD (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion Epidural dexmedetomidine of 0.5µg/kg added slightly extra analgesic effect to ropivacaine in EA for cesarean section. The sedation of 0.5µg/kg epidural dexmedetomidine did not cause mother-baby bonding deficit. Satisfaction with anesthesia wasn’t significantly improved by epidural dexmedetomidine of 0.5µg/kg. No additional side effect allows larger dose of epidural dexmedetomidine attempt. Trial registration: This study was registered at www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2000038853)",

      "abstract": "Effectively summarizing and re-expressing video content by natural languages in a more human-like fashion is one of the key topics in the field of multimedia content understanding. Despite good progress made in recent years, existing efforts usually overlooked the emotions in user-generated videos, thus making the generated sentence a bit boring and soulless. To fill the research gap, this paper presents a novel emotional video captioning framework in which we design a Vision-based Emotion Interpretation Network to effectively capture the emotions conveyed in videos and describe the visual content in both factual and emotional languages. Specifically, we first model the emotion distribution over an open psychological vocabulary to predict the emotional state of videos. Then, guided by the discovered emotional state, we incorporate visual context, textual context, and visual-textual relevance into an aggregated multimodal contextual vector to enhance video captioning. Furthermore, we optimize the network in a new emotion-fact coordinated way that involves two losses- Emotional Indication Loss and Factual Contrastive Loss, which penalize the error of emotion prediction and visual-textual factual relevance, respectively. In other words, we innovatively introduce emotional representation learning into an end-to-end video captioning network. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets, EmVidCap and EmVidCap-S, demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Quantitative ablation studies and qualitative analyses clearly show that our method is able to effectively capture the emotions in videos and thus generate emotional language sentences to interpret the video content.",

      "abstract": "Group activity recognition aims to identify a consistent group activity from different actions performed by respective individuals. Most existing methods focus on learning the interaction between each two individuals (i.e., second-order interaction). In this work, we argue that the second-order interactive relation is insufficient to address this task. We propose a third-order active factor graph network, which models the third-order interaction in each pair of three active individuals. At first, to alleviate the noisy individual actions, we select active individuals by measuring each individual's influence. The individuals with the top-k largest influence weights are selected as active individuals. Then, for each three-individuals pair, we build a new factor node and contact the factor node with these individual nodes. In other words, we extend the base second-order interactive graph to a new third-order interactive graph, which is defined as factor graph. Next, we design a two-branch factor graph network, in which one branch is to consider all individuals (denoted as full factor graph) and the other one takes the active individuals into consideration (denoted as active factor graph). We leverage both the active and full factor graphs comprehensively for group activity recognition. Besides, to enforce group consistency, a consistency-aware reasoning module is designed with two penalty terms, which describe the inconsistency between individual actions and group activity respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets, i.e., Volleyball, Collective Activity, Collective Activity Extended, and SoccerNet-v3 datasets. Visualization results further validate the interpretability of our method.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography measurement (also called rPPG prediction) is a vision-based technique that allows for the non-contact monitoring of human physiological activity using facial video. However, precisely detecting subtle color changes on facial skin, especially in less-constrained real-life scenarios, remains a formidable challenge for rPPG prediction. In this work, we address a rPPG-based heart rate estimation task by proposing an end-to-end Channel-wise Interaction Network (CIN-rPPG), in which the core idea contains two specialized units: channel-temporal interactive learning (CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>T</i></sub> ) and channel-spatial interactive learning (CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>S</i></sub> ). The CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>T</i></sub> unit gets the periodicity of the rPPG signal by using temporal-wise shifting and channel-wise scaling to measure the interaction between channels and temporal dimensions. The CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>S</i></sub> unit does both spatial-wise scaling and channel-wise scaling at the same time to perform channel-spatial interaction. This is intended to reveal how rPPG-related visual responses are detected on the human face. We exploit the rPPG recovery through the alternation of CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>T</i></sub> and CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>S</i></sub> implementations. The CIN-rPPG is completely conducted by convolutional operations on the sequential 2D feature maps of facial video in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on three heart rate estimation datasets (UBFC-rPPG, PURE, and MMSE-HR) demonstrate that CIN-rPPG achieves state-of-the-art performance on both intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is widely recognized that polyester (PET) fibers with swelling properties are necessary for advanced applications of PET fibers in waterproof fabrics. This study presented the UV‐initiated methods to graft polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel on the surface of PET fibers. In the one‐step method, PET fibers are impregnated with a mixed solution of the photoinitiator benzophenone (BP) and the monomer acrylalkylamine (AM). Then, the PET fiber was directly exposed to UV light. In the two‐step method, PET fibers were first impregnated with a photoinitiator solution to generate BP radicals. Then, the fibers impregnated with a monomer solution before being grafted by UV light. Both two methods ultimately achieve PAM gelation‐modified PET fibers. The chemical composition and surface structure were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope. The findings demonstrate that the PAM hydrogel was successfully grafted on the PET fibers through one‐step method or a two‐step method. In addition, the properties of the grafted PET fibers were evaluated by grafting yield, contact angle, and swelling test. The study indicated that the modified PET fibers via a two‐step method exhibited a superior grafting yield up to 29.3% (PET‐2n) and 54% (PET‐2) compared to the one‐step technique (PET‐1). It was shown that the grafting efficacy of PET fibers modified by two‐step method is better than one‐step method. The static contact angles of PET fibers by UV‐Induced were all reduced. For instance, the contact angles of PET‐2n were decreased from 115° to 62.9°; and the two‐step modified PET fiber after acetone cleaning (PET‐2) decreased from 115° to 60°. It was suggested that the hydrophilicity of the modified PET fibers significantly increased. In addition, the research shows that the gelation‐modified fibers were all possessed swelling properties.",

      "abstract": "Effectively leveraging objects and optical character recognition (OCR) tokens to reason out pivotal scene text is critical for the challenging Text-based Visual Question Answering (TextVQA) task. Graph-based models can effectively capture the semantic relationship among visual entities (objects and tokens) and report remarkable performance in TextVQA. However, previous efforts usually leverage all visual entities and ignore the negative effect of superfluous entities. This article presents a Graph Pooling Inference Network (GPIN), which is an evolutionary graph learning method to purify the visual entities and capture the core semantics. It is observed that the dense distribution of reduplicative objects and the crowd of semantically dependent OCR tokens usually co-exist in the image. Motivated by this, GPIN adopts an adaptive node dropping strategy to dynamically downscale semantically closed nodes for graph evolution and update. To deepen the comprehension of scene text, GPIN is a dual-path hierarchical graph architecture that progressively aggregates the evolved object graph and the evolved token graph semantics into a graph vector that serves as visual cues to facilitate the answer reasoning. It can effectively eliminate object redundancy and enhance the association of semantically continuous tokens. Experiments conducted on TextVQA and ST-VQA datasets show that GPIN achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Generating image captions in different languages is worth exploring and essential for non-native speakers. Nevertheless, collecting paired annotation for every language is time-consuming and impractical, particularly for minor languages. To this end, the cross-lingual image captioning task is proposed, which leverages existing image-source caption annotation data and wild unrelated target corpus to generate satisfactory caption in the target language. Current methods perform a two-step translation process of image-to-pivot (source) and pivot-to-target. The distinct two-step process comes with certain caption issues, such as the weak semantic alignment between the image and the generated caption and the generated caption’s non-target language style. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end reinforce learning framework with Visual-linguistic-stylistic Triple Reward named TriR. In TriR, we jointly consider the visual, linguistic, and stylistic alignments to generate factual, fluent, and natural caption in the target language. To be specific, the image-source caption annotation provides factual semantic guidance, whereas the unrelated target corpus guides the language style of generated caption. To achieve this, we construct a visual reward module to measure the cross-modal semantic embedding of image and target caption, a linguistic reward module to measure the cross-linguistic embedding of source and target captions, and a stylistic reward module to imitate the presentation style of target corpus. The TriR can be implemented with either classical CNN-LSTM or prevalent Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments are conducted with four cross-lingual settings, i.e., Chinese-to-English, English-to-Chinese, English-to-German, and English-to-French. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of our method, and sufficient ablation experiments validate the beneficial impact of every reward.",

      "abstract": "Text-based person re-identification (ReID) has enabled canonical applications in searching for and tracking targets from large-scale surveillance images with textual descriptions. Yet, existing text-based person ReID systems employ centralized model training that gathers images captured by different institutes' cameras into one place, which poses severe privacy threats to sensitive institutional information. This work is then devoted to exploring privacy-preserving text-based person ReID and proposes the framework of FedSH by tailoring the federated learning paradigm for distributed searching knowledge extraction. Specifically, FedSH resolves the local model generalization and entity boundary obscuring limitations, caused by inner-institute data homogeneity and inter-institute data heterogeneity, via building multi-granularity feature representation and a semantically self-aligned network. Meanwhile, it reduces the communication burden introduced by the embedding for multiple modals by updating common representation subspaces during federated learning. Experimental results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve at most 16.47% and 16.02% person ReID performance improvement by the Rank-1 metric, compared with 6 State-of-The-Art (SoTA) baselines and 6 ablation studies. We believe that our work will inspire the community to investigate the potential of implementing Federated Learning in real-world image retrieval and ReID scenarios.",

However, existing captioning methods usually overlooked the learning of emotions in user-generated videos, thus making the generated sentence a bit boring and soulless.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the solution of our team HFUT-VUT for the\\nMultiMediate Grand Challenge 2023 at ACM Multimedia 2023. The solution covers\\nthree sub-challenges: bodily behavior recognition, eye contact detection, and\\nnext speaker prediction. We select Swin Transformer as the baseline and exploit\\ndata augmentation strategies to address the above three tasks. Specifically, we\\ncrop the raw video to remove the noise from other parts. At the same time, we\\nutilize data augmentation to improve the generalization of the model. As a\\nresult, our solution achieves the best results of 0.6262 for bodily behavior\\nrecognition in terms of mean average precision and the accuracy of 0.7771 for\\neye contact detection on the corresponding test set. In addition, our approach\\nalso achieves comparable results of 0.5281 for the next speaker prediction in\\nterms of unweighted average recall.\\n",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our solution to the MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge in the MuSe 2023 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge. The task of MuSe-Personalisation aims to predict the continuous arousal and valence values of a participant based on their audio-visual, language, and physiological signal modalities data. Considering different people have personal characteristics, the main challenge of this task is how to build robustness feature presentation for sentiment prediction. To address this issue, we propose exploiting diverse features. Specifically, we proposed a series of feature extraction methods to build a robust representation and model ensemble. We empirically evaluate the performance of the utilized method on the officially provided dataset. As a result, we achieved 3rd place in the MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge. Specifically, we achieve the results of 0.8492 and 0.8439 for MuSe-Personalisation in terms of arousal and valence CCC.",

Furthermore, the AHGF method is introduced to skew-normal setting. Simulation results show that the AHGF method shows more advantages than traditional methods. Specifically, the AHGF method often has a smaller mean square error for point estimation. And for interval estimation, the AHGF method behaves closer to the nominal level than other methods while maintaining comparable or shorter lengths. Finally, a temperature dataset and a sunspot series are applied to illustrate the proposed AHGF methodology.",

      "abstract": "Multimedia-based recommendation (MMRec) utilizes multimodal content (images, textual descriptions, etc.) as auxiliary information on historical interactions to determine user preferences. Most MMRec approaches predict user interests by exploiting a large amount of multimodal contents of user-interacted items, ignoring the potential effect of multimodal content of user-uninteracted items. As a matter of fact, there is a small portion of user preference-irrelevant features in the multimodal content of user-interacted items, which may be a kind of spurious correlation with user preferences, thereby degrading the recommendation performance. In this work, we argue that the multimodal content of user-uninteracted items can be further exploited to identify and eliminate the user preference-irrelevant portion inside user-interacted multimodal content, for example by counterfactual inference of causal theory. Going beyond multimodal user preference modeling only using interacted items, we propose a novel model called Multimodal Counterfactual Learning Network (MCLN), in which user-uninteracted items' multimodal content is additionally exploited to further purify the representation of user preference-relevant multimodal content that better matches the user's interests, yielding state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and rationality of MCLN. We release the complete codes of MCLN at https://github.com/hfutmars/MCLN.",

      "abstract": "Aiming at the difficulty of efficiency optimization control caused by unequal inductance parameters of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor(IPMSM), a PMSM efficiency optimization control strategy based on iterative algorithm is proposed. The equivalent transformation method is used to convert the total motor loss into functions related to the d axis current and find its partial derivative value. The optimal efficiency of the motor is optimized by using the partial derivative value and the Adam algorithm. This method can shorten the optimization time while achieving the best efficiency of the motor, and adjust the learning rate in real time to avoid the fluctuation of speed and torque caused by too fast current change. The experimental results show that compared with $i_{d}=0$ control and traditional loss model control, this method can effectively improve the motor efficiency and has fast dynamic response performance.",

      "abstract": "This article tackles the challenging yet important task of Visual Grounding (VG), which aims to localize a visual region in the given image referred by a natural language query. Existing efforts on the VG task are twofold: (1) two-stage methods first extract region proposals and then rank them according to their similarities with the referring expression, which usually leads to suboptimal results due to the quality of region proposals; (2) one-stage methods usually predict all the possible coordinates of the target region online by leveraging modern object detection architectures, which pay little attention to cross-modality correlations and have limited generalization ability. To better address the task, we present an effective transformer-based end-to-end visual grounding approach, which focuses on capturing the cross-modality correlations between the referring expression and visual regions for accurately reasoning the location of the target region. Specifically, our model consists of a feature encoder, a cross-modality interactor, and a modality-agnostic decoder. The feature encoder is employed to capture the intra-modality correlation, which models the linguistic context in query and the spatial dependency in image respectively. The cross-modality interactor endows the model with the capability of highlighting the localization-relevant visual and textual cues by mutual verification of vision and language, which plays a key role in our model. The decoder learns a consolidated token representation enriched by multi-modal contexts and further directly predicts the box coordinates. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets with quantitative and qualitative analysis clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and rationale of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Multimedia-based recommendation is a challenging task that requires not only learning collaborative signals from user-item interaction, but also capturing modality-specific user interest clues from complex multimedia content. Though significant progress on this challenge has been made, we argue that current solutions remain limited by multimodal noise contamination. Specifically, a considerable proportion of multimedia content is irrelevant to the user preference, such as the background, overall layout, and brightness of images; the word order and semantic-free words in titles; <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">etc</i> . We take this irrelevant information as noise contamination to discover user preferences. Moreover, most recent research has been conducted by graph learning. This means that noise is diffused into the user and item representations with the message propagation; the contamination influence is further amplified. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel framework named Multimodal Graph Contrastive Learning (MGCL), which captures collaborative signals from interactions and uses visual and textual modalities to respectively extract modality-specific user preference clues. The key idea of MGCL involves two aspects: First, to alleviate noise contamination during graph learning, we construct three parallel graph convolution networks to independently generate three types of user and item representations, containing collaborative signals, visual preference clues, and textual preference clues. Second, to eliminate as much preference-independent noisy information as possible from the generated representations, we incorporate sufficient self-supervised signals into the model optimization with the help of contrastive learning, thus enhancing the expressiveness of the user and item representations. Note that MGCL is not limited to graph learning schema, but also can be applied to most matrix factorization methods. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to validate the effectiveness and scalability of MGCL <xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sup>1</sup></xref> <fn id=\"fn1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><label><sup>1</sup></label> We release the codes of MGCL at <uri>https://github.com/hfutmars/MGCL</uri>. </fn> .",

      "abstract": "Text-based visual question answering (TextVQA) faces the significant challenge of avoiding redundant relational inference. To be specific, a large number of detected objects and optical character recognition (OCR) tokens result in rich visual relationships. Existing works take all visual relationships into account for answer prediction. However, there are three observations: (1) a single subject in the images can be easily detected as multiple objects with distinct bounding boxes (considered repetitive objects). The associations between these repetitive objects are superfluous for answer reasoning; (2) two spatially distant OCR tokens detected in the image frequently have weak semantic dependencies for answer reasoning; and (3) the co-existence of nearby objects and tokens may be indicative of important visual cues for predicting answers. Rather than utilizing all of them for answer prediction, we make an effort to identify the most important connections or eliminate redundant ones. We propose a sparse spatial graph network (SSGN) that introduces a spatially aware relation pruning technique to this task. As spatial factors for relation measurement, we employ spatial distance, geometric dimension, overlap area, and DIoU for spatially aware pruning. We consider three visual relationships for graph learning: object-object, OCR-OCR tokens, and object-OCR token relationships. SSGN is a progressive graph learning architecture that verifies the pivotal relations in the correlated object-token sparse graph, and then in the respective object-based sparse graph and token-based sparse graph. Experiment results on TextVQA and ST-VQA datasets demonstrate that SSGN achieves promising performances. And some visualization results further demonstrate the interpretability of our method.",

A natural language query can be used to describe a particular video segment in an untrimmed video. Given such a natural language query,the target of video grounding is focused on locating an action segment in the untrimmed video. As a highlevel semantic understanding task in computer vision,video grounding faces many challenges,since it requires the joint modeling of visual modality and linguistic modality simultaneously. First,compared to static images,the content of videos in the real world usually contains more complicated scenes. Such a few-minute video is usually composed of several action scenarios,which can be as an integration status of actors,objectives,and motions. Second,natural language is inevitably ambiguous and subjective to some extent. The description of the same activity may diverse. Intuitively,there is a big semantic gap for visual and textual-between modality. Therefore,it needs to build an appropriate video-text multi-modal feature for accurate grounding further. To resolve the challenges mentioned above,we facilitate a novel proposal-free method to learn an appropriate multi-modal features with motion excitation. Specifically,the motion excitation is exploited to highlight motion clues of multi-modal features for accurate grounding. Method The proposed method consists of three key modules relevant to:1) feature extraction,2) feature optimization,and 3) boundary prediction. First,for the feature extraction module,the 3D convolutional neural network(CNN) networks and a bi-directional long short-term memory(BiLSTM) layer is used to get the video and query features. To get fine-grained semantic cues from a language query,we extract attention mechanism-based phrase-level feature of the query. The video-text multi-modal features can be focused on multiple semantic phrases via fusing the phrase-level and video features. Subsequently,we highlight the motion information in the above multi-modal features in the feature optimization module. The features contain contextual clues of motion on temporal dimension. Meanwhile,some channels of the features represent the dynamic motion pattern of the target moment;the other channels represent irrelevant redundant information. To optimize multi-modal feature representation utilizing motion information,the skip-connection convolution and the motion excitation are used in the feature optimization module. 1) For the skip-connection convolution,a 1D temporal convolution network is used to model the local context of motion and align it with the query on the temporal dimension. 2) For the motion excitation,the temporal adjacent multimodal feature vectors-between differences is calculated,and the attention weight distribution of motion channel response is constructed,and the motion-sensitive channels are activated. Finally,we aggregate the multi-modal features focused on different semantic phrases. Non-local neural network is utilized to model the dependency among different semantic phrases. A temporal attentive pooling module is employed to aggregate the feature into a vector and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) layer to regress the temporal boundaries as well. Result Extensive experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on two public datasets,e. g.,the Charades-STA dataset and the ActivityNet Captions dataset. Comparative analysis can be reached to 52. 36% and 42. 97% in terms of the evaluation metric mean intersection over union (mIoU) on these two datasets. In addition,each of the evaluation metric R@1,IoU={0. 3,0. 5,0. 7} can reach to 73. 79%,61. 16%,52. 36% and 60. 54%,43. 68%,25. 43%. It is also compared with such two methods like local-global video-text interactions (LGI) and contextual pyramid network (CPNet). Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant improvement in performance compared to other methods. Conclusion To optimize the complicated scenes of the video and bridge the gap between the video and the language,we enhance the motion patterns in related to video grounding. Accordingly,the usage of the skip-connection convolution and the motion excitation can be used optimize video-text multi-modal feature representation effectively. In this way,the model can be used to represent semantic matching information between video clips and text queries accurately to a certain extent.",

Path analysis was employed to investigate the relationships among variables related to teachers' social mentality. The findings revealed a relatively high level of \"social mentality\" among primary and secondary school teachers in Anshan. A significant disparity in job satisfaction levels was observed based on teachers' educational backgrounds, indicating the crucial role played by general self-efficacy and job involvement in this mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Temporal modeling still remains as a challenge for action recognition. Most existing temporal models focus on learning local variation between neighbor frames. There exists obvious deviations between local and global variations, such as subtle and notable motion variations. In this paper, we propose a global temporal difference module for action recognition, which consists of two sub-modules, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i> , a global aggregation module and a global difference module. These two sub-modules cooperate following the idea of using prior knowledge from the global view ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i> , global motion variation) to guide local learning at each moment. In the global aggregation module, the global prior knowledge is learned by aggregating the visual feature sequence of video into a global vector. In the global difference module, we prepare the difference vector sequence of video by subtracting each local vector from the global vector. Our method performs as a contextual guidance with a global view. The sequential dependency between these difference vectors is exploited with a channel-wise self-attention operation. Finally, the difference vectors at each timestamp are further used to enhance the semantics of the original local features. The enhanced features endow the action recognition has less deviation to understand the variation in the video globally. We instantiate the global temporal difference module into the ResNet block to form a global temporal difference network (GTDNet). Exhaustive experiments are conducted and our method achieves competitive performance at small FLOPs on Something-Something V1 & V2 and Kinetics-400.",

      "abstract": "Visual and audio signals often coexist in natural environments, forming audio-visual events (AVEs). Given a video, we aim to localize video segments containing an AVE and identify its category. It is pivotal to learn the discriminative features for each video segment. Unlike existing work focusing on audio-visual feature fusion, in this paper, we propose a new contrastive positive sample propagation (CPSP) method for better deep feature representation learning. The contribution of CPSP is to introduce the available full or weak label as a prior that constructs the exact positive-negative samples for contrastive learning. Specifically, the CPSP involves comprehensive contrastive constraints: pair-level positive sample propagation (PSP), segment-level and video-level positive sample activation (PSA <sub>S</sub> and PSA <sub>V</sub>). Three new contrastive objectives are proposed (i.e., [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]) and introduced into both the fully and weakly supervised AVE localization. To draw a complete picture of the contrastive learning in AVE localization, we also study the self-supervised positive sample propagation (SSPSP). As a result, CPSP is more helpful to obtain the refined audio-visual features that are distinguishable from the negatives, thus benefiting the classifier prediction. Extensive experiments on the AVE and the newly collected VGGSound-AVEL100k datasets verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.",

      "abstract": "Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging biomedical imaging modality that combines optical and ultrasonic imaging, providing overlapping fields of view. This hybrid approach allows for a natural integration of PAT and ultrasound (US) imaging in a single platform. Due to the similarities in signal acquisition and processing, the combination of PAT and US imaging creates a new hybrid imaging for novel clinical applications. Over the recent years, particular attention is paid to the development of PAT/US dual-modal systems highlighting mutual benefits in clinical cases, with an aim of substantially improving the specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis of diseases. The demonstrated feasibility and accuracy in these efforts open an avenue of translating PAT/US imaging to practical clinical applications. In this review, the current PAT/US dual-modal imaging systems are discussed in detail, and their promising clinical applications are presented and compared systematically. Finally, this review describes the potential impacts of these combined systems in the coming future.",

      "abstract": "Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to generate the visual appearance of sign language according to the spoken language, in which a key procedure is to translate sign Gloss to Pose (G2P). Existing G2P methods mainly focus on regression prediction of posture coordinates, namely closely fitting the ground truth. In this paper, we provide a new viewpoint: a Gloss semantic-Enhanced Network is proposed with Online Back-Translation (GEN-OBT) for G2P in the SLP task. Specifically, GEN-OBT consists of a gloss encoder, a pose decoder, and an online reverse gloss decoder. In the gloss encoder based on the transformer, we design a learnable gloss token without any prior knowledge of gloss, to explore the global contextual dependency of the entire gloss sequence. During sign pose generation, the gloss token is aggregated onto the existing generated poses as gloss guidance. Then, the aggregated features are interacted with the entire gloss embedding vectors to generate the next pose. Furthermore, we design a CTC-based reverse decoder to convert the generated poses backward into glosses, which guarantees the semantic consistency during the processes of gloss-to-pose and pose-to-gloss. Extensive experiments on the challenging PHOENIX14T benchmark demonstrate that the proposed GEN-OBT outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Visualization results further validate the interpretability of our method.",

      "abstract": "Cross modal retrieval receives intensive attention for flexible queries between different modalities. However, in practice it is challenging to retrieve cross modal content with noisy labels. The latest research on machine learning shows that a model tends to fit cleanly labeled data at early learning stage and then memorize the data with noisy labels. Although the clustering strategy in cross modal retrieval can be utilized for alleviating outliers, the networks will rapidly overfit after clean data is fitted well and the noisy labels begin to force the cluster center drift. Motivated by these fundamental phenomena, we propose an Early Learning regularized Contrastive Learning method for Cross Modal Retrieval with Noisy Labels (ELRCMR). In the solution, we propose to project the multi-modal data to a shared feature space by contrastive learning, in which early learning regularization is employed to prevent the memorization of noisy labels when training the model, and the dynamic weight balance strategy is employed to alleviate clustering drift. We evaluated the method with extensive experiments, and the result shows the proposed method could solve the cluster drift in conventional solutions and achieve promising performance on widely used benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates an emerging and challenging task—emotional video captioning. Formally, given a video, the task aims to not only describe the factual content of the video, but also discover the emotional clues in the video. We propose a novel Contextual Attention Network (CANet), which recognizes and describes the fact and emotion in the video by semantic-rich context learning. To be specific, at each time step, we first extract visual and textual features from both input video and previously generated words. Then, we apply the attention mechanism to these features to capture informative contexts for captioning. We train the CANet model with the joint optimization of cross-entropy loss <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CE}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and contrastive loss <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CL}$</tex-math></inline-formula> , where <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CE}$</tex-math></inline-formula> constrains the semantics of the generated sentence to be close to human annotation and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CL}$</tex-math></inline-formula> encourages discriminative representation learning from positive and negative pairs of video and caption. Experiments on two emotional video captioning datasets (i.e., EmVidCap and EmVidCap-S) demonstrate the superiority of CANet compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "In most E-commerce platforms, whether the displayed items trigger the user’s interest largely depends on their most eye-catching multimodal content. Consequently, increasing efforts focus on modeling multimodal user preference, and the pressing paradigm is to incorporate complete multimodal deep features of the items into the recommendation module. However, the existing studies ignore the mismatch problem between multimodal feature extraction (MFE) and user interest modeling (UIM) . That is, MFE and UIM have different emphases. Specifically, MFE is migrated from and adapted to upstream tasks such as image classification. In addition, it is mainly a content-oriented and non-personalized process, while UIM, with its greater focus on understanding user interaction, is essentially a user-oriented and personalized process. Therefore, the direct incorporation of MFE into UIM for purely user-oriented tasks, tends to introduce a large number of preference-independent multimodal noise and contaminate the embedding representations in UIM. This paper aims at solving the mismatch problem between MFE and UIM, so as to generate high-quality embedding representations and better model multimodal user preferences. Towards this end, we develop a novel model, m ultimodal e ntity g raph c ollaborative f iltering, short for MEGCF. The UIM of the proposed model captures the semantic correlation between interactions and the features obtained from MFE, thus making a better match between MFE and UIM. More precisely, semantic-rich entities are first extracted from the multimodal data, since they are more relevant to user preferences than other multimodal information. These entities are then integrated into the user-item interaction graph. Afterwards, a symmetric linear Graph Convolution Network (GCN) module is constructed to perform message propagation over the graph, in order to capture both high-order semantic correlation and collaborative filtering signals. Finally, the sentiment information from the review data are used to fine-grainedly weight neighbor aggregation in the GCN, as it reflects the overall quality of the items, and therefore it is an important modality information related to user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of MEGCF. 1",

      "abstract": "Most works of image captioning are implemented under the full supervision of paired image-caption data. Limited to expensive cost of data collection, the task of unpaired image captioning has attracted researchers' attention. In this article, we propose a novel memorial GAN (MemGAN) with the joint semantic optimization for unpaired image captioning. The core idea is to explore implicit semantic correlation between disjointed images and sentences through building a multimodal semantic-aware space (SAS). Concretely, each modality is mapped into a unified multimodal SAS, where SAS includes the semantic vectors of image I , visual concepts O , unpaired sentence S , and the generated caption C . We adopt the memory unit based on multihead attention and relational gate as a backbone to preserve and transit crucial multimodal semantics in the SAS for image caption generation and sentence reconstruction. Then, the memory unit is embedded into a GAN framework to exploit the semantic similarity and relevance in SAS, that is, imposing a joint semantic-aware optimization on SAS without supervision clues. To summarize, the proposed MemGAN learns the latent semantic relevance of SAS's multimodalities in an adversarial manner. Extensive experiments and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGAN, achieving improvements over state of the arts on unpaired image captioning benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Lipreading is a task of decoding the movement of the speaker’s lip region into text. In recent years, lipreading methods based on deep neural network have attracted widespread attention, and the accuracy has far surpassed that of experienced human lipreaders. The visual differences in some phonemes are extremely subtle and pose a great challenge to lipreading. Most of the lipreading existing methods do not process the extracted visual features, which mainly suffer from two problems. First, the extracted features contain lot of useless information such as noise caused by differences in speech speed and lip shape, for example. In addition, the extracted features are not abstract enough to distinguish phonemes with similar pronunciation. These problems have a bad effect on the performance of lipreading. To extract features from the lip regions that are more distinguishable and more relevant to the speech content, this article proposes an end-to-end deep neural network-based lipreading model (LCSNet). The proposed model extracts the short-term spatio-temporal features and the motion trajectory features from the lip region in the video clips. The extracted features are filtered by the channel attention module to eliminate the useless features and then used as input to the proposed Selective Feature Fusion Module (SFFM) to extract the high-level abstract features. Afterwards, these features are used as input to the bidirectional GRU network in time order for temporal modeling to obtain the long-term spatio-temporal features. Finally, a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoder is used to generate the output text. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves a 1.0% CER and 2.3% WER on the GRID corpus database, which, respectively, represents an improvement of 52% and 47% compared to LipNet.",

      "abstract": "Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs), with their efficient ability to capture high-order connectivity in graphs, have been widely applied in recommender systems. Stacking multiple neighbor aggregation is the major operation in GCNs. It implicitly captures popularity features because the number of neighbor nodes reflects the popularity of a node. However, existing GCN-based methods ignore a universal problem: users' sensitivity to item popularity is differentiated, but the neighbor aggregations in GCNs actually fix this sensitivity through Graph Laplacian Normalization, leading to suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose to model multi-grained popularity features and jointly learn them together with high-order connectivity, to match the differentiation of user preferences exhibited in popularity features. Specifically, we develop a Joint Multi-grained Popularity-aware Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering model, short for JMP-GCF, which uses a popularity-aware embedding generation to construct multi-grained popularity features, and uses the idea of joint learning to capture the signals within and between different granularities of popularity features that are relevant for modeling user preferences. Additionally, we propose a multistage stacked training strategy to speed up model convergence. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to show the state-of-the-art performance of JMP-GCF.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using PAT and MSOT for detecting histology in a rabbit tracheal stenosis model. Method: A total of 12 rabbits (9 stenosis and three control) were randomly divided into four groups (A, B, C and D). Each group consisted of three rabbits, which were staged at the first, fourth, and eighth weeks of stenosis progression, respectively. PAT/MSOT images and corresponding histology from these experimental animals were compared, for analyzing the morphologic features and quantitative tracheal measurements in different tracheal stenosis stage. Result: Both the PAT images and corresponding histology indicated the most severe degree of stenosis in group C. MSOT images indicated notable differences in tracheal contents of group B and D. Conclusion: This study suggests that PAT/MSOT are potentially valuable non-invasive modality which are capable of evaluating tracheal structure and function in vivo .",

Video question answering not only needs to capture clues from questions but also reasonably infer the certain clip or frame in videos. In the paper, we propose a novel method to understand the entire video and reasonably infer the answer to the question. We utilize a traditional attention mechanism combined with the multi-head structure to construct a differentiated attention module. Different from existing methods, our method is dedicated to obtaining differentiated features. Videos on our method are split into a few video clips, and there is a great overlap between video clips. Thus, simple using the self-attention mechanism to aggregate features will lead to excessive redundancy in the captured features. To tackle this issue, we propose a differentiated attention module consists of traditional attention mechanism and multi-head structure to focus on the core semantics and decode different clips or phrases. In addition, we also apply the differentiated attention block on question aggregation and video clues reasoning. We use different query attention loss (DQALoss) to solve the problem of question requiring stronger differentiation. Meanwhile, we propose to utilize the multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling method to solve multi-modal features reasoning and interaction. Our experiment shows that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on TGIF-QA datasets by large margins. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) addresses the novel object recognition problem by leveraging semantic embedding to transfer knowledge from seen categories to unseen categories. Generative ZSL models synthesize the visual features of unseen classes and convert ZSL task into a classical supervised learning problem. These generative ZSL models are trained by using the seen classes. Although promising progress has been achieved in the ZSL and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) tasks. The existing approaches still suffer from a strong bias problem between unseen and seen classes, where unseen objects in the target domain tend to be recognized as seen classes in the source domain. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel named semantic consistent Wasserstein generative adversarial network (scWGAN), which uses a semantic reconstructor to reconstruct semantic embeddings from generated visual features by incorporating a novel Semantic Consistent Loss noted L rec . The Semantic Consistent Loss guides our proposed scWGAN to generate visual features that mirror the semantic relationships between seen and unseen classes. We also introduce a visual classifier to constrain visual feature generator. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach is superior to previous state-of-the-art works under both traditional ZSL and challenging GZSL settings on six popular data sets AWA1, AWA2, CUB, APY, and SUN.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) algorithm is used to conduct an in‐depth analysis of HR strategic decision‐making and an HR strategic decision model is constructed for simulation. The four evaluation dimensions of index screening are extracted, the generalized gray correlation analysis is applied to screen the initial selection indexes of HR strategic decision‐making, and then the HR strategic decision‐making index system of power supply enterprises is constructed. On this basis, the applicability of the BP neural network in HR strategic decision‐making is analysed and demonstrated, a BP neural network‐based HR strategic decision‐making model for power supply enterprises is constructed, and the rationality of the model is illustrated through the model training and testing. Finally, an empirical study is conducted with S power supply company as an example to illustrate the operability of the BP network model for HR strategic decision‐making. The results of this paper provide a scientific basis for human resource decision‐making in power supply enterprises and provide theoretical support for promoting the healthy development of power supply enterprises. Improving the level of human resource management can make fuller use of human resources and realize the strategic goals of the enterprise. A strategy for optimizing the training of hybrid convolutional neural networks is proposed, using an exponential linear unit activation function to solve the problem of neuron dead zones, a hybrid pooling strategy is used to improve the problem of feature information loss in maximum pooling processing, and an improved cross‐entropy loss function is used to solve the problem of insufficient learning of difficult classification samples. The optimization of the model training process is finally completed, and the recommendation quality is improved. The Bayesian probability distribution table is learned to be filled in the expert data set; finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the model are tested on the experimental platform. The results of the experiments show that the established Bayesian model beats the platform’s built‐in intelligent method with a 78.2% win rate. That is, the model can make intelligent recommendations for strategies in staffed and unmanned platform decision‐making and command‐and‐control combat units to execute tactical actions to achieve the best operational effectiveness.",

The main components of the data are extracted by PLS method, and then combined with BP neural network, the PLS‐BP model is constructed. At the end of the article, the PLS‐BP evaluation model is simulated and analyzed. From the comparison results, the error between the PLS‐BP evaluation model and traditional performance evaluation is relatively small, and the maximum relative error is 2.32%.

      "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a challenging problem, as it requires a joint understanding of video and natural language question. Existing methods perform correlation learning between video and question have achieved great success. However, previous methods merely model relations between individual video frames (or clips) and words, which are not enough to correctly answer the question. From human's perspective, answering a video question should first summarize both visual and language information, and then explore their correlations for answer reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new method called Pairwise VLAD Interaction Network (PVI-Net) to address this problem. Specifically, we develop a learnable clustering-based VLAD encoder to respectively summarize video and question modalities into a small number of compact VLAD descriptors. For correlation learning, a pairwise VLAD interaction mechanism is proposed to better exploit complementary information for each pair of modality descriptors, avoiding modeling uninformative individual relations (e.g., frame-word and clip-word relations), and exploring both inter- and intra-modality relations simultaneously. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three VideoQA datasets: TGIF-QA, MSVD-QA, and MSRVTT-QA.",

      "abstract": "Sign language translation (SLT) is a challenging weakly supervised task without word-level annotations. An effective method of SLT is to leverage multimodal complementarity and to explore implicit temporal cues. In this work, we propose a graph-based multimodal sequential embedding network (MSeqGraph), in which multiple sequential modalities are densely correlated. Specifically, we build a graph structure to realize the intra-modal and inter-modal correlations. First, we design a graph embedding unit (GEU), which embeds a parallel convolution with channel-wise and temporal-wise learning into the graph convolution to learn the temporal cues in each modal sequence and cross-modal complementarity. Then, a hierarchical GEU stacker with a pooling-based skip connection is proposed. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, to obtain a compact and informative representation of multimodal sequences, the GEU stacker gradually compresses the channel <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$d$</tex-math></inline-formula> with multi-modalities <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> rather than the temporal dimension <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t$</tex-math></inline-formula> . Finally, we adopt the connectionist temporal decoding strategy to explore the entire video's temporal transition and translate the sentence. Extensive experiments on the USTC-CSL and BOSTON-104 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Methods: In this paper, based on neuropsychology, the distribution of teaching staff in colleges and universities was studied, and the model of talent evaluation and distribution was constructed. Results: Firstly, the generalized regression neural network was optimized by genetic algorithm. Then, the genetic algorithm’s generalized regression neural network calculation process was designed. Conclusion: Finally, with the example of teacher resources in a university, the algorithm in this paper was tested. The results show that the results of the generalized regression neural network optimized by genetic algorithm can match the actual situation very well, and the method is feasible with certain advantages.",

      "abstract": "Visual dialog is a challenging task that requires the comprehension of the semantic dependencies among implicit visual and textual contexts. This task can refer to the relational inference in a graphical model with sparse contextual subjects (nodes) and unknown graph structure (relation descriptor); how to model the underlying context-aware relational inference is critical. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware graph (CAG) neural network. We focus on the exploitation of fine-grained relational reasoning with object-level dialog-historical co-reference nodes. The graph structure (relation in dialog) is iteratively updated using an adaptive top- K message passing mechanism. To eliminate sparse useless relations, each node has dynamic relations in the graph (different related K neighbor nodes), and only the most relevant nodes are attributive to the context-aware relational graph inference. In addition, to avoid negative performance caused by linguistic bias of history, we propose a pure visual-aware knowledge distillation mechanism named CAG-Distill, in which image-only visual clues are used to regularize the joint dialog-historical contextual awareness at the object-level. Experimental results on VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets show that both CAG and CAG-Distill outperform comparative methods. Visualization results further validate the remarkable interpretability of our graph inference solution.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of video grounding - localizing activities in an untrimmed video via a natural language query - is to tackle the semantics of vision and language consistently along the temporal dimension. Most existing proposal-based methods are trapped by computational cost with extensive candidate proposals. In this paper, we propose a novel proposal-free framework named Contextual Pyramid Network (CPNet) to investigate multi-scale temporal correlation in the video. Specifically, we propose a pyramid network to extract 2D contextual correlation maps at different temporal scales (T*T, T/2*T/2, T/4*T/4), where the 2D correlation map (past to current &amp; future to current) is designed to model all the relations of any two moments in the video. In other words, CPNet progressively replenishes the temporal contexts and refines the location of queried activity by enlarging the temporal receptive fields. Finally, we implement a temporal self-attentive regression (i.e., proposal-free regression) to predict the activity boundary from the above hierarchical context-aware 2D correlation maps. Extensive experiments on ActivityNet Captions, Charades-STA, and TACoS datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Based on RCS, conventional methods for aerospace target classification need to construct artificial features, and there is little explanation for the classification results. In this paper, an intelligent and partly interpretable method is proposed for classifying a swarm of aerospace targets, including cone targets, false targets, engines and so on. The fully convolutional neural network is adopted to extract the features of time series and to achieve the classification of different targets. Moreover, the class activation map is introduced to highlight the subsequences that contribute the most to a certain classification, and Gramian Angular Summation Field is used to visualize the time series and the weights in the neural network. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for aerospace target classification and analysis.",

      "abstract": "Temporal action proposal generation is a hot topic in the field of video understanding, aiming to extract action instances in long untrimmed videos. Although various approaches have been proposed, the challenge of proposal generation with reliable confidence scores and precise boundaries still exists. To solve this challenge, we propose a novel proposal generation framework called Anchor Offset Prediction Network (AOPNet), which utilizes multi-layer Bidirectional RNN (BiRNN) to predict multi-scale action proposals and fine-tune temporal boundaries with the predicted anchor offsets. Experimental results demonstrate that though with the use of anchor boundary offset prediction module, the AOPNet can remarkably improve the classification accuracy of temporal anchors and finally generate temporal proposals with high recall. Ablation studies on the THUMOS-14 dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

In this paper, we propose a novel memory-based network rather than GAN, named Recurrent Relational Memory Network (R2M). Unlike complicated and sensitive adversarial learning that non-ideally performs for long sentence generation, R2M implements a concepts-to-sentence memory translator through two-stage memory mechanisms: fusion and recurrent memories, correlating the relational reasoning between common visual concepts and the generated words for long periods. R2M encodes visual context through unsupervised training on images, while enabling the memory to learn from irrelevant textual corpus via supervised fashion. Our solution enjoys less learnable parameters and higher computational efficiency than GAN-based methods, which heavily bear parameter sensitivity. We experimentally validate the superiority of R2M than state-of-the-arts on all benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Visual dialog is a challenging task that requires the comprehension of the semantic dependencies among implicit visual and textual contexts. This task can refer to the relation inference in a graphical model with sparse contexts and unknown graph structure (relation descriptor), and how to model the underlying context-aware relation inference is critical. To this end, we propose a novel Context-Aware Graph (CAG) neural network. Each node in the graph corresponds to a joint semantic feature, including both object-based (visual) and history-related (textual) context representations. The graph structure (relations in dialog) is iteratively updated using an adaptive top-K message passing mechanism. Specifically, in every message passing step, each node selects the most K relevant nodes, and only receives messages from them. Then, after the update, we impose graph attention on all the nodes to get the final graph embedding and infer the answer. In CAG, each node has dynamic relations in the graph (different related K neighbor nodes), and only the most relevant nodes are attributive to the context-aware relational graph inference. Experimental results on VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets show that CAG outperforms comparative methods. Visualization results further validate the interpretability of our method.",

      "abstract": "MapReduce jobs need to shuffle a large amount of data over the network between mapper and reducer nodes. The shuffle time accounts for a big part of the total running time of the MapReduce jobs. Therefore, optimizing the makespan of shuffle phase can greatly improve the performance of MapReduce jobs. A large fraction of production jobs in data centers are recurring with predictable characteristics, and the recurring jobs split the network into periodic busy and idle time slots, which allows us to better schedule the shuffle data in order to reduce the makespan of shuffle phase with the future predictable network status available. In this paper, we formulate the shuffle scheduling problem with the aim to minimize the makespan of MapReduce shuffle phase by leveraging the predictable periodic network status. We then propose a simple yet effective network-aware shuffle scheduling algorithm (NAS) to reduce the number of idle time slots required to transfer the shuffle data so as to reduce the shuffle makespan. We also prove that the proposed algorithm NAS is a 3/2-approximation algorithm to the shuffle scheduling problem when all the future idle time slots have the same duration. We finally conduct experiments through simulations. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the makespan of MapReduce shuffle phase and increase network utilization.",

      "abstract": "Visual dialog is a challenging task in multimedia understanding, which requires the dialog agent to answer a series of questions that are based on an input image. The critical issue to produce an exact answer is how to model the mutual semantic interaction among feature representations of the image, question-answer history, and current question. In this study, we propose a textual-visual Reference-Aware Attention Network (RAA-Net), which aims to effectively fuse Q (question), H (history), Vl (local vision), and Vg (global vision) to infer the exact answer. In the multimodal feature flows, RAA-Net first learns the textual context through multi-head attention between Q and H and then guides the textual reference semantics to the image to capture visual reference semantics by self-and cross-reference-aware attention in and between Vl and Vg. In the proposed RAA-Net, we exploit the two-stage (intraand inter-) visual reasoning mechanism on Vl and Vg. Extensive experiments on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets show that RAA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results on both visual and textual attention maps further validate the remarkable interpretability achieved by our solution.",

      "abstract": "Most existing CNN-based methods for crowd counting always suffer from large scale variation in objects of interest, leading to density maps of low quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep model called Dilated-Attention-Deformable ConvNet (DADNet), which consists of two schemes: multi-scale dilated attention and deformable convolutional DME (Density Map Estimation). The proposed model explores a scale-aware attention fusion with various dilation rates to capture different visual granularities of crowd regions of interest, and utilizes deformable convolutions to generate a high-quality density map. There are two merits as follows: (1) varying dilation rates can effectively identify discriminative regions by enlarging the receptive fields of convolutional kernels upon surrounding region cues, and (2) deformable CNN operations promote the accuracy of object localization in the density map by augmenting the spatial object location sampling with adaptive offsets and scalars. DADNet not only excels at capturing rich spatial context of salient and tiny regions of interest simultaneously, but also keeps a robustness to background noises, such as partially occluded objects. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify that DADNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results of the multi-scale attention maps further validate the remarkable interpretability achieved by our solution.",

      "abstract": "Continuous sign language recognition task is challenging for the reason that the ordered words have no exact temporal locations in the video. Aiming at this problem, we propose a method based on pseudo-supervised learning. First, we use a 3D residual convolutional network (3D-ResNet) pre-trained on the UCF101 dataset to extract visual features. Second, we employ a sequence model with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss for learning the mapping between the visual features and sentence-level labels, which can be used to generate clip-level pseudo-labels. Since the CTC objective function has limited effects on visual features extracted from early 3D-ResNet, we fine-tune the 3D-ResNet by feeding the clip-level pseudo-labels and video clips to obtain better feature representation. The feature extractor and the sequence model are optimized alternately with CTC loss. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the large datasets RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014.",

      "abstract": "Video captioning is a challenging problem in neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing. It aims to translate a given video into a sequence of words which can be understood by humans. The dynamic information in videos and the complexity in linguistic cause the difficulty of this task. This paper proposes a semantic enhanced encoder-decoder network to tackle this problem. To explore a more abundant variety of video information, it implements a three path fusion strategy in the encoder side which combines complementary features. In the decoding stage, the model adopts an attention mechanism to consider the different contributions of the fused features. In both the encoder and decoder side, the video information is well obtained. Furthermore, we use the idea of reinforcement learning to calculate rewards based on semantic designed computation. Experimental results on Microsoft Video Description Corpus (MSVD) dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Vision-based sign language translation (SLT) is a challenging task due to the complicated variations of facial expressions, gestures, and articulated poses involved in sign linguistics. As a weakly supervised sequence-to-sequence learning problem, in SLT there are usually no exact temporal boundaries of actions. To adequately explore temporal hints in videos, we propose a novel framework named Hierarchical deep Recurrent Fusion (HRF). Aiming at modeling discriminative action patterns, in HRF we design an adaptive temporal encoder to capture crucial RGB visemes and skeleton signees. Specifically, RGB visemes and skeleton signees are learned by the same scheme named Adaptive Clip Summarization (ACS), respectively. ACS consists of three key modules, i.e., variable-length clip mining, adaptive temporal pooling, and attention-aware weighting. Besides, based on unaligned action patterns (RGB visemes and skeleton signees), a query-adaptive decoding fusion is proposed to translate the target sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HRF framework.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the sign video interpretation which is a weakly supervised task. Each sign action in videos lacks exact boundaries or labels. We design a Parallel Temporal Encoder (PTEnc) to learn the temporal relation of a sign video from local and global sequential learning views in parallel. PTEnc utilizes the complementarity between the local and global temporal cues. Then, fused encoded feature sequence is fed into a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based sentence decoder. In addition, in order to enhance the temporal cues in each video, we introduce a reconstruction loss, which performs in an unsupervised way without additional labels. The CTC loss cooperates with the reconstruction loss in an end-to-end training manner. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "The sign language translation (SLT) which aims at translating a sign language video into natural language is a weakly supervised task, given that there is no exact mapping relationship between visual actions and textual words in a sentence label. To align the sign language actions and translate them into the respective words automatically, this paper proposes a dense temporal convolution network, termed DenseTCN which captures the actions in hierarchical views. Within this network, a temporal convolution (TC) is designed to learn the short-term correlation among adjacent features and further extended to a dense hierarchical structure. In the kth TC layer, we integrate the outputs of all preceding layers together: (1) The TC in a deeper layer essentially has larger receptive fields, which captures long-term temporal context by the hierarchical content transition. (2) The integration addresses the SLT problem by different views, including embedded short-term and extended longterm sequential learning. Finally, we adopt the CTC loss and a fusion strategy to learn the featurewise classification and generate the translated sentence. The experimental results on two popular sign language benchmarks, i.e. PHOENIX and USTCConSents, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of various measurements.",

      "abstract": "Online sign interpretation suffers from challenges presented by hybrid semantics learning among sequential variations of visual representations, sign linguistics, and textual grammars. This paper proposes a Connectionist Temporal Modeling (CTM) network for sentence translation and sign labeling. To acquire short-term temporal correlations, a Temporal Convolution Pyramid (TCP) module is performed on 2D CNN features to realize (2D+1D)=pseudo 3D' CNN features. CTM aligns the pseudo 3D' with the original 3D CNN clip features and fuses them. Next, we implement a connectionist decoding scheme for long-term sequential learning. Here, we embed dynamic programming into the decoding scheme, which learns temporal mapping among features, sign labels, and the generated sentence directly. The solution using dynamic programming to sign labeling is considered as pseudo labels. Finally, we utilize the pseudo supervision cues in an end-to-end framework. A joint objective function is designed to measure feature correlation, entropy regularization on sign labeling, and probability maximization on sentence decoding. The experimental results using the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather and USTC-CSL datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Visual dialog is a challenging task, which involves multi-round semantic transformations between vision and language. This paper aims to address cross-modal semantic correlation for visual dialog. Motivated by that Vg (global vision), Vl (local vision), Q (question) and H (history) have inseparable relevances, the paper proposes a novel Dual Visual Attention Network (DVAN) to realize (Vg, Vl, Q, H)--&gt; A. DVAN is a three-stage query-adaptive attention model. In order to acquire accurate A (answer), it first explores the textual attention, which imposes the question on history to pick out related context H'. Then, based on Q and H', it implements respective visual attentions to discover related global image visual hints Vg' and local object-based visual hints Vl'. Next, a dual crossing visual attention is proposed. Vg' and Vl' are mutually embedded to learn the complementary of visual semantics. Finally, the attended textual and visual features are combined to infer the answer. Experimental results on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Meanwhile it follows the law of technological evolution system in process of electronic courses learning, which solves the technical contradictions and physical contradictions in the system, and proposes a variety of active learning modes of classroom mode. Then we analyze the results of teaching students in the two academic years, it shows that the new mode of teaching reform is helpful to mobilize the initiative of students' learning, which cultivate innovative ability of solving practical problems in engineering, it provides a broader perspective for the development of outstanding professionals in higher education institutions. Introduce TRIZ theory, is a comprehensive theoretical system, which Altshuller led TRIZ research group, analyze nearly 2.5 million high-level invention patents in the world, forming a system composed of methods and algorithms for solving technology and achieving innovative development. We Introduce the TRIZ theory into the curriculum system of electrical engineering, and cultivate students learning process from micro world to macro world, from individual element to whole one, from unknown areas to mastered one, which students adopt divergent thinking and use their existing theoretical systems and logical thinking methods to discover Problems, analyze problems and solve problemï¼Œ which are currently hot issues in teaching reform research.",

      "abstract": "As an indispensable process of cross-media analyzing, comprehending heterogeneous data faces challenges in the fields of visual question answering (VQA), visual captioning, and cross-modality retrieval. Bridging the semantic gap between the two modalities is still difficult. In this article, to address the problem in cross-modality retrieval, we propose a cross-modal learning model with joint correlative calculation learning. First, an auto-encoder is used to embed the visual features by minimizing the error of feature reconstruction and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is utilized to model the textual features embedding. Then we design a joint loss function to optimize both the intra- and the inter-correlations among the image-sentence pairs, i.e., the reconstruction loss of visual features, the relevant similarity loss of paired samples, and the triplet relation loss between positive and negative examples. In the proposed method, we optimize the joint loss based on a batch score matrix and utilize all mutual mismatched paired samples to enhance its performance. Our experiments in the retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on three benchmarks, i.e., Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MS-COCO.",

      "abstract": "The single image super‐resolution (SISR) methods based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have recently achieved significant improvements in accuracy, advancing the state of the art. However, these deeper models are computationally expensive and require a large number of parameters. Accordingly, they demand more memory and are unsuitable for on‐chip devices. In this study, a novel SISR method using a deeply recursive CNN with skip connections and a network in network structure is proposed. The deeply recursive CNN with skip connections is adopted for the image feature extraction at both local and global levels. Parallelised 1 × 1 CNNs, usually called a network in network structure, are adopted for image reconstruction. Specifically, recursive learning is utilised to control the number of model parameters needed and residual learning is used to ease the difficulty of training. The proposed method performs favourably against the state‐of‐the‐art methods in terms of computational speed and accuracy. It significantly outperforms the previous methods by a large margin, while demanding far fewer parameters. This model requires less memory and is friendly to on‐chip devices.",

      "abstract": "Continuous sign language translation (CSLT) is a weakly supervised problem aiming at translating vision-based videos into natural languages under complicated sign linguistics, where the ordered words in a sentence label have no exact boundary of each sign action in the video. This paper proposes a hybrid deep architecture which consists of a temporal convolution module (TCOV), a bidirectional gated recurrent unit module (BGRU), and a fusion layer module (FL) to address the CSLT problem. TCOV captures short-term temporal transition on adjacent clip features (local pattern), while BGRU keeps the long-term context transition across temporal dimension (global pattern). FL concatenates the feature embedding of TCOV and BGRU to learn their complementary relationship (mutual pattern). Thus we propose a joint connectionist temporal fusion (CTF) mechanism to utilize the merit of each module. The proposed joint CTC loss optimization and deep classification score-based decoding fusion strategy are designed to boost performance. With only once training, our model under the CTC constraints achieves comparable performance to other existing methods with multiple EM iterations. Experiments are tested and verified on a benchmark, i.e. the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

First, it effectively calculates optimal candidate routes for evacuation. Second, an evaluation method is proposed for estimating these candidate routes. Third, CC-Adap utilizes a contraflow-based method to reconfigure the evacuation routes to improve capacity constraints. Fourth, traffic conditions are updated in real time. Fifth, CC-Adap reuses historical evacuation routes to reduce the computational cost and accelerate the evacuation process. Experimental results show that CC-Adap generates high-performing evacuation strategies and can be used to tackle large-scale evacuation planning.",

      "abstract": "Continuous Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task due to its specific linguistics under sequential gesture variation without word alignment. Current hybrid HMM and CTC (Connectionist temporal classification) based models are proposed to solve frame or word level alignment. They may fail to tackle the cases with messing word order corresponding to visual content in sentences. To solve the issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical-LSTM (HLSTM) encoder-decoder model with visual content and word embedding for SLT. It tackles different granularities by conveying spatio-temporal transitions among frames, clips and viseme units. It firstly explores spatio-temporal cues of video clips by 3D CNN and packs appropriate visemes by online key clip mining with adaptive variable-length. After pooling on recurrent outputs of the top layer of HLSTM, a temporal attention-aware weighting mechanism is proposed to balance the intrinsic relationship among viseme source positions. At last, another two LSTM layers are used to separately recurse viseme vectors and translate semantic. After preserving original visual content by 3D CNN and the top layer of HLSTM, it shortens the encoding time step of the bottom two LSTM layers with less computational complexity while attaining more nonlinearity. Our proposed model exhibits promising performance on singer-independent test with seen sentences and also outperforms the comparison algorithms on unseen sentences.",

      "abstract": "In sign language recognition (SLR) with multimodal data, a sign word can be represented by multiply features, for which there exist an intrinsic property and a mutually complementary relationship among them. To fully explore those relationships, we propose an online early-late fusion method based on the adaptive Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In terms of the intrinsic property, we discover that inherent latent change states of each sign are related not only to the number of key gestures and body poses but also to their translation relationships. We propose an adaptive HMM method to obtain the hidden state number of each sign by affinity propagation clustering. For the complementary relationship, we propose an online early-late fusion scheme. The early fusion (feature fusion) is dedicated to preserving useful information to achieve a better complementary score, while the late fusion (score fusion) uncovers the significance of those features and aggregates them in a weighting manner. Different from classical fusion methods, the fusion is query adaptive. For different queries, after feature selection (including the combined feature), the fusion weight is inversely proportional to the area under the curve of the normalized query score list for each selected feature. The whole fusion process is effective and efficient. Experiments verify the effectiveness on the signer-independent SLR with large vocabulary. Compared either on different dataset sizes or to different SLR models, our method demonstrates consistent and promising performance.",

      "abstract": "Given a multi-source and multi-sink transportation network, the contraflow-based method performs well in evacuation under complex capacity constraints on the roads in the network. This paper proposes a Contraflow-based algorithm based on Max-Flow Rate Priority strategy (CMFRP) to reconfigure the network to improve the evacuation performance. Firstly, the proposed algorithm generates candidate routes by the Dijkstra algorithm and determines an optimal evacuation route based on the max-flow rate priority strategy under capacity condition. Then, to simulate reasonable traffic control in the real world, CMFRP reconfigures the network structure and improves the upper bound capacities of selected roads to increase evacuee stream. Thus, the contraflow-based method could avoid serious congestion and accelerate the evacuation process. Experimental results indicate that CMFRP algorithm has a good performance on the trade of evacuation time and run time. It is also stable under different transportation network configurations.",

      "abstract": "Clearly visualized networks provide a great help in understanding complex systems, which require designing efficient layout algorithm to draw the network diagrams. Compared with force-directed algorithm, the algorithms of grid-optimization series have the advantage of avoiding node overlap through positioning nodes on square grid points of twodimensional. However, for networks of several thousand nodes, the computation costs of extant grid layouts are too high to meet the visualization requirements. In order to improve computation performance, this article proposes a new grid point matching based algorithm named grid-based layout (GBL) with three procedures to draw complex networks. Firstly, graph clustering algorithm is applied to divide network into several modules constituted of closely connected nodes, then all modules are placed on separated two-dimensional space as global layout, and finally, the grid layout algorithm is applied to position the child nodes within these modules as local optimization. With GBL help, users can gain insights of global topological structure of network as well as detailed connectivity within these modules. In particular, an improved weight strategy is designed to speed up optimization process. Compared with latest available grid layout algorithm, GBL shows relatively better performances in computing time, edge–edge crossings, node–edge crossings, relative edge lengths and connectivity F-measures.",

      "abstract": "Vision based sign language recognition (SLR) is a challenging task due to the complexity of signs and limited data collection. To improve the recognition precision, this paper proposes an adaptive GMM-based (Gaussian mixture model) HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) framework. We discover that inherent latent states in HMMs are not only related to the number of key gestures and body poses, but also related to the kinds of their translation relationships. We propose adaptive HMMs and obtain the hidden state number for each sign with affinity propagation clustering. Furthermore, to enrich the training dataset, we propose a data augmentation strategy by adding Gaussian random disturbances. Experiments on a vocabulary of 370 signs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over the comparison algorithms.",

This paper proposes a heuristic approach to solve the evacuation route planning problem with capacity constrained transportation network. At first, we obtain multiple candidate routes. Each vertex in these candidate routes has available residual capacity on its predictive arrived time step. Then, a Max-Flow Rate Priority (MFRP) algorithm is designed to iteratively select the evacuation routes with maximum flow rate by time step marching. After that, MFRP updates the potential available capacity of the transportation network for the next iteration. MFRP improves the performance of the evacuation route planning as its high-velocity evacuee stream. The experimental results on different datasets indicate that the proposed approach can produce well-performed tactic for the evacuation route planning problem.",

      "abstract": "Frequent pattern mining has been a hot topic in many research domains, such as bioinformatics and text retrieval. Many seemingly disorganized constituents connected with different gap constraints often repetitively appear in these real-word sequences, which are considered as latent frequent patterns (FPs). A latent FP both with flexible gap and approximate constraints (replacement, deletion and insertion operations) deepen difficulty to discover its true occurrences. We design a Mining Approximate frequent PAttern (MAPA) algorithm to handle the problem: (1) We first extend an Approximate Edit Distance Matrix (A-EDM) by tackling replacement, insertion and deletion under the gap constraint to discover various deformations of patterns. (2) Then we employ an effectively back-tracking Approximate Pattern Matching (APM) scheme to obtain each candidate latent FP's support. (3) Finally, an Apriori-like deterministic pruning tactic is proposed to avoid generating unnecessary candidates for mining validation. The MAPA algorithm is a unified framework for both exact mining and approximate mining. Experiments on DNA and protein sequences demonstrate that MAPA is efficient on solutions, time and memory consumption than other peers.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a model of cost management controlling system was established for implementation and supervision of strategic management in petroleum enterprise. Using this model, various controlling methods are divided into five grades under different strategies. Each grade is assigned a value by the expert scoring method, and the scores of cost management controlling system could be calculated. If the score is greater than zero, the cost management controlling system will have a positive effect on strategy; if the score is less than zero, it will have a negative effect on strategy. With the method proposed, the cost management evaluation of the fourth oil recovery company of Daqing Oilfield was carried out and the results were reasonable.",

      "abstract": "Multiple antenna technology for wireless communications is becoming mature and wide ranging in the wireless broadband network. Many spectrum usage measurement reports have shown that inaccurate spectrum sensing will waste spectrum resources. A Multiple Antenna Asynchronous Cognitive MAC (MAAC-MAC) protocol is proposed through introducing a multiple antenna architecture and power control mechanism into the hardware-constrained cognitive MAC (MHC-MAC) protocol with Asynchronous-Assembly Line Mode in cognitive radio network. In the spectrum sensing stage, the protocol makes use of multiple antennas to perform spectrum sensing and positioning, aimed at improving spectrum sensing and detection performance. During the negotiation phase, the CU (Cognitive User) access power control mechanism fully utilizes the licensed band without interfering PU (Primary User) and also increases the transmission rate and system throughput. It may be used for improved positioning and location-based services both indoors and outd...",

We propose an FNP algorithm based on Free-Node Optimum Pruning. Each Free-Node set is a set of nodes labeled by the same number which appear on different layers in a directed graph structure WON-Net. Compared on biological data and artificial data, experimental results show that (1) FNP has a significant advantage with its solutions, winning above 95% of biological data among similar algorithms. There are theorems on obtaining optimal solutions by FNP. (2)FNP demonstrates an evident advantage on running time, when |Net| is large and k is small. (|Net| denotes the number of independent substructures without losing solutions in WON-Net and k is the number of Free-Node sets.)",

      "abstract": "Sequential pattern mining is an important research task in many domains, such as biological science. In this paper, we study the problem of mining frequent patterns from sequences with wildcards. The user can specify the gap constraints with flexibility. Given a subject sequence, a minimal support threshold and a gap constraint, we aim to find frequent patterns whose supports in the sequence are no less than the given support threshold. We design an efficient mining algorithm MAIL. Two pattern growth strategies are proposed to improve the completeness and the time efficiency. One is based on the candidate occurrence pruning, and the other uses an occurrence graph. A random data generator is designed to test the completeness on artificial data. Experiments on DNA sequences show that MAIL mines four times more patterns than one of its peers and the time performance is six times faster on average than its another peer. We also give a concrete example in which our algorithm is applied on DNA sequences to find interesting patterns.",

In this paper, we investigate the factors impacting the location of distribution center during earthquake responses, and propose a decision-making model based on improved AHP framework for this issue. The improved AHP is extended to automatically calculate large scale judgment matrices by the crosstie model. This decision-making model was successfully applied in the simulation case of Yushu earthquake responses in 2010. The results show that the proposed decision-making model is reasonable.",

Given a sequence S and a pattern P consisting of sub patterns separated by flexible wildcards, the problem is to find P's all occurrences with exact match positions under the one-off condition and length constraints. We propose an algorithm, PMW that locates each subpattern of P in S as soon as it appears in S in O(m+n+j(GM+a.)) time with O(m+A) space overhead. Compared to the previous peers theoretical analysis and experimental results show that PMW is more competitive. It has an advantage on both the time and space complexities. It also has better stability with the increasing of the maximum gap constraints or the number of subpatterns.",

      "abstract": "Pattern matching with both gap constraints and the one-off condition is a challenging topic, especially in bioinformatics, information retrieval, and dictionary query. Among the algorithms to solve the problem, the most efficient one is SAIL, which is time consuming, especially when the pattern is long. In addition, existing algorithms based on bit-parallelism cannot handle a pattern that has only one pattern character between successive wildcards and the minimum local length constraints are zero. We propose an algorithm BPBM to handle online sequential pattern matching. In BPBM, an extended bit-parallelism operation is used to accelerate the matching process. An effective transition window mechanism with two nondeterministic finite state automatons (NFAs) is adopted to drop the useless scan window. It identifies gap constraints automatically and just scans once to export occurrences with exact match positions. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the BPBM algorithm is more competitive than other peers. It has an absolute advantage on search time complexity. It also has better stability that decreases operation costs with the increasing of the size of sequence alphabet or the length of the pattern. We also study off-line pattern matching. With twice pruning, left-most and right-most, we can increase the matching ratio about 2.08% on average.",

      "abstract": "Sequential pattern mining is an important research task in many domains, such as biological science. In this paper, we study the problem of mining frequent patterns from sequences with wildcards. The user can specify the gap constraints with flexibility. Given a subject sequence, a minimal support threshold and a gap constraint, we aim to find frequent patterns whose supports in the sequence are no less than the given support threshold. We design an efficient mining algorithm MAIL that utilizes the candidate occurrences of the prefix to compute the support of a pattern that avoids the rescanning of the sequence. We present two pruning strategies to improve the completeness and the time efficiency of MAIL. Experiments show that MAIL mines 2 times more patterns than one of its peers and the time performance is 12 times faster on average than its another peer.",

      "abstract": "Many spectrum usage measurement reports have shown that the fixed-frequency allocation mechanism causes unbalanced resource occupancy. Most of the current sensing policies assume the same utilisation rate for various channels. Therefore, their performance cannot be optimised in the presence of sensing constraints. This paper proposes a modified sensing policy based on the statistical property of licensed channels. Using the negotiation rule and the statistics sensing results for the perception phase, the proposed approach can always select the licensed channels with the lowest statistical occupation number. The probability statistics approach is used to formulate the proposed sensing policies for the saturation network. Both analytical and simulation results are presented to validate the proposed model. The results show that our proposed sensing policy can maintain sensing efficiency without adding constraints and also guarantee that more available licensed channels are available. In addition, the computational cost, i.e., sensing number and time, can be reduced. We conclude that our proposed sensing policy can make full use of spectrum resources to improve network throughput.",

      "abstract": "As the penetration of broadband Internet access, the online Internet video is prevailing. The peer-to-peer (P2P) assisted video accelerator (VA) attracted much attention recently. Based on the real-world measurement results of online videos and users' viewing behavior, we prove the P2P VA method is feasible and efficient. We first prove, although the distribution of clicks on online videos is long-tail and only a few videos have high click rate, these videos account for considerable views, which means considerable clicks occur when multiple users are online simultaneously, and therefore the P2P method is feasible. We second prove its efficiency by using a large-scale real-world user click trace to do trace-driven simulation. The simulation results show, in the worst case in which users shut down the system after they finishes the view, the method can still decrease the server load by 25.6%. When the user is cooperative and keeps the system up for additional 30 min after he/she watches the video, the server load can be decreased by 50.6%.",

      "abstract": "With the flourishing development of wideband wireless communication, wireless spectrum resource gets scarcer. But on the other hand, spectrum utilization is inefficient because of current static spectrum allocation. In the paper, channel combination technology is applied in cognitive multi-channel MAC protocol to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization, and propose Cognitive Channel combination Multi-Channel MAC Protocol (CCC-MMAC). Base on the Bernoulli model, the saturation throughput of CCC-MMAC is analyzed. From the analytical result, CCC-MMAC can realize better saturation throughput and fairness.",

The search engine is an important tool for users to access online video, resulting in considerable traffic on the video Websites. In this work, we statistically analyze the video access log provided by a large scale video search engine, and validate that the aggregated views of online video from the search engine is diurnally regular. Furthermore, we find the probability of abrupt surge or disappearance of views is significantly high, having a percentage of 20% all videos. The results also show that 30% of them are spike that indicates that an accessing surge of views is followed by an immediate and abrupt falling. Such a result renders the big challenge how the Website providers can satisfy the quality of service in providing their videos to users during the surging period. The online video access also indicates the social behaviors of the corresponding social group. These results are revealed by studying the querying string at the search engine. These results can be useful for the Website developer to optimize the video system by allocating appropriate system resources according to the accessing habits of the users.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the cognitive wireless network draws the great attention since it can effectively improve the spectrum efficiency based on its spectrum cognition. In this paper, we extend the definition of wireless cognitive network, which focuses on the channel quality cognition. By measuring the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of received signal, cognitive wireless network based on channel quality cognition adjusts its transmission rate, which accordingly selects different modulation and demodulation technology in Physical Layer. In this paper, we first analyze the BER (Bit Error Rate) of various modulation and demodulation methods described in IEEE 802.11b. Then, we propose Nakagami-m distribution to simulate the fading channel of cognitive wireless network. We analyze the performance of cognitive wireless network over fading channel based on the IEEE 802.11 MAC (Medium Access Control) mechanism. Finally, we validate our model through various simulations and present the impact of fading channel on cognitive wireless network.",

By studying the relationship between the number of video that a Web site owns and the number of clicks it obtains from the video search engine, we find they are highly correlative, which infers that current video Web sites are highly homogeneous from the view of video search engine. Our observations prove the video search engine keeps the diversity of online video, and it helps users to explore more videos, and compare different copies of same video content to obtain the best result.",

It extends the Minimum link paths (MLPs) in a constraint-based algorithm to perform pedestrians' global path computations for avoiding diverse obstacles in complex dynamic scenes. Simultaneously, it uses a modified social force model to capture pedestrians' local dynamics with distinct individual characteristics and intermediate goals. The model has augmented the pedestrian's cognitive capability on environment. At global level, it minimizes the shortest global path graph for avoiding obstacles. At local level, it intelligently selects the immediate target in global path graph which instructs the pedestrian local motion, instead of using a pre-defined or a single goal attraction path potential. We simulate the model in a complex indoor scenario consisting of multiple pedestrians and diverse obstacles to generate realistic animation.",

However, due to the asymmetric bandwidth problem faced by many peers, the uplink bandwidth at individual peers cannot be fully utilized. In this paper, we propose Coop-Stream, a distributed video streaming service that takes advantage of multiple cooperative peers. In Coop-Stream, a set of users/peers collaboratively provide video streaming service to the requesting users, even if individual users/peers' upload bandwidth may not be sufficient to stream the entire video. Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) based workload allocation scheme further maximized the perceived video quality at the requesting user/peer.",

In particular, it reports the results of a questionnaire survey of TQM practices in Chinese companies. The research identifies a series of concepts under TQM and the significant benefits it can bring to organisations to help them continuously improve, not only in product or service quality but also in integrated company management. The results from the questionnaire indicate that the adoption of TQM in China is extensive, and the majority of the expected benefits in the literature have been delivered to these Chinese companies. In addition, the questionnaire also includes two comparisons of organisation performance: one is between companies with and without TQM; the other is among TQM companies. The findings provide evidence that TQM can positively impact firm performance depending on the degree of implementation.",

Second,C hinese teaching is restrieted by national collgeg entrance exam.Third,the teachi ng methodology is stereotyped.Therefore,before a thorough reform on textbooks an d the exam system,there must be a breakthrough in the concept of chinese teachin g and enhancement of the quality of the teachers.That is to say,the Chinese cour se should be regarded not only as a science but an aesthetic art and the knowledge strure and aesthetic t aste of Chinese teachers must be improved comprehensively.",
