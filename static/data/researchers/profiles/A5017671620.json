A strong longitudinal emphasis exists on multimodal (text, audio, image, physiological) emotion understanding, increasingly grounded in clinical validity (e.g., psychiatric scales), explainability, and robustness (e.g., speaker generalization, uncertainty awareness, bias mitigation). Recent work shows a pronounced shift toward integrating large language models with emotion science—via prompt engineering, knowledge injection, causal reasoning, and brain–language alignment—while maintaining fine-grained, aspect-level, and distributional modeling of affect. The trajectory reflects a maturing field: from lexical and sentence-level sentiment analysis (2010s) to clinically interpretable, multimodal, neuro-informed, and generative affective AI (2023–2025).",

      "abstract": "Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Recently, mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformers have garnered increased attention for their advantages in model capacity and computational efficiency. However, studies have indicated that MoE models excel in pre-training but fail to translate those gains to downstream tasks, which diminishes their practical value. To explain this issue, we propose that the pre-training performance and transfer capability of a model jointly determine its downstream task performance. More specifically, we argue that MoE models exhibit weaker transfer capability compared to vanilla models, resulting in inferior performance on downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, positing that although vanilla models have weaker performance, they are effective teachers of transfer capability. The MoE models—guided by vanilla models—can achieve both strong pre-training performance and transfer capability, ultimately enhancing their performance on downstream tasks. We developed a specific distillation method and conducted experiments using the BERT architecture. Experimental results show significant improvements in the downstream performance of MoE models, and further evidence supports the concept of transfer-capability distillation. Finally, we attempt to interpret transfer capability distillation and provide insights from the perspective of model features.",

      "abstract": "Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application. Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs) techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective replies.",

      "abstract": "The integration of multimodal information, particularly visual content, into dialogue systems has primarily focused on interpreting user-provided inputs, while comparatively little attention has been given to the proactive use of such content to enhance responses. In this paper, we explore a new research direction that addresses this gap by enabling dialogue systems to autonomously determine when and how to supplement textual responses with relevant images, based on conversational context and user intent. To support this goal, we propose AMI (Automated Multimodal Insertion), a novel framework for dynamic, context-aware multimodal supplementation in dialogue. We also introduce RID (Response with Appropriate Image Dataset), a bilingual (Chinese-English) multimodal multi-turn dialogue dataset designed to train and evaluate systems on this capability. RID features fine-grained annotations on image insertion timing and rationale, along with carefully aligned image-text pairs to ensure semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with RID not only generate more informative and engaging responses, but also exhibit a stronger ability to leverage visual content when it is truly beneficial. These findings highlight the potential of proactive multimodal supplementation and offer new insights for advancing the development of intelligent, human-like dialogue systems.

      "abstract": "As an increasing number of users share their lives and mental states on social media, many studies attempt to detect depression risk through social media videos using non-verbal cues like facial expressions, posture, gaze, and intonation from individual social media platforms, a proven effective field. However, these studies have focused on single-video level analysis to detect depression. These researches fail to capture the dynamic nature of social media streams and the complex, often gradual manifestation of depression. This limitation overlooks the comprehensive mental state of users, which can only be understood through their extended video histories. To address this, we introduce the Multimodal User-level Depression Detection Dataset (MUD3). MUD3 includes the long-term video histories of depressed users on social media platforms, containing user mental states across multiple videos and treating the video histories as a continuous social media stream. This allows us to model multiple videos at the user-level and analyze users' long-term mental states. MUD3 and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Syx1030/MUD3.",

      "abstract": "Video question answering (VideoQA) necessitates simultaneous understanding of visual and linguistic information, requiring both in-depth analysis of individual modality features and the establishment of cross-modal correlations to achieve precise reasoning. However, VideoQA models often struggle with irrelevant temporal and spatial noise due to the dense events and concepts in real-world complex video contents. Previous works reduce noise by only sampling a fixed number of visual tokens at the patch level, overlooking the variation in the required granularities of features and quantities of visual cues across different question conditions. To address these, we propose an Aggregating-then-Pruning Sampler (APSam), which diversifies feature granularities and adaptively denoises on a per-question basis. Specifically, we propose a conditional token aggregator to obtain multi-granularity visual semantics by merging similar question-relevant tokens. Then, we propose a conditional token pruner, which restricts noise tokens through a variable-capacity receptive field determined by the inputs. Experimental results show that APSam achieves significant performance on three challenging complex VideoQA datasets, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, AGQAv2, NExT-QA, and STAR. Further analyses reveal that the APSam also exhibits high reasoning capability and interpretability.",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative, rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for mitigating security risks in real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in dialogue policy planning have focused on optimizing system agent policies to achieve predefined goals, emphasizing strategy design, trajectory acquisition, and training efficiency.However, these approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as personality, preferences, and goals.To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study using task-specific user personas to evaluate dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors.Our analysis, based on these user profiles, reveals significant shortcomings in existing approaches, underscoring the necessity for user-tailored dialogue policies.Building on these insights, we propose the User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which integrates an Intrinsic User World Model to capture user traits and feedback.UDP operates in three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, employing a diffusion model to dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, using a Brownian Bridge-inspired mechanism to predict user reactions; and (3) User-Tailored Policy Planning, synthesizing these elements to optimize response strategies.To enhance robustness, we introduce an active learning approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training.Extensive experiments across benchmarks, including both collaborative and non-collaborative settings, demonstrate UDP's effectiveness in learning user-specific dialogue strategies.Results confirm the framework's utility, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric dialogue systems.",

      "abstract": "Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination. To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs' visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only with minimal additional inference cost.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g., intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Waste-Wood/Com2.",

      "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) with demonstrations. However, obtaining these demonstrations primarily relies on manual effort. In most real-world scenarios, users are often unwilling or unable to provide such demonstrations. Inspired by the human analogy, we explore a new ICL paradigm CrossICL to study how to utilize existing source task demonstrations in the ICL for target tasks, thereby obtaining reliable guidance without any additional manual effort. To explore this, we first design a two-stage alignment strategy to mitigate the interference caused by gaps across tasks, as the foundation for our experimental exploration. Based on it, we conduct comprehensive exploration of CrossICL, with 875 NLP tasks from the Super-NI benchmark and six types of LLMs, including GPT-4o. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossICL and provide valuable insights on questions like the criteria for selecting cross-task demonstrations, as well as the types of task-gap-induced interference in CrossICL.",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained language models represented by the Transformer have been proven to possess strong base capabilities, and the representative self-attention mechanism in the Transformer has become a classic in sequence modeling architectures. Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities. Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then, through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture improvements and novel designs.",

      "abstract": "Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying, highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously. Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference. Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.",

Current efforts are directed toward modeling speaker-sensitive context dependencies and multimodal fusion. However, they still struggle to handle utterances from unseen speakers, hampering the model's generalizability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Speaker Generalization Framework for MERC. Specifically, we build a prototype graph to learn Speaker-based Utterance Representations (SUR), leveraging prototypes as the bridge between seen and unseen speakers. Speaker-aware Contrastive Learning (CL) is then applied to refine SUR, pulling utterances (or prototypes) from the same speaker together while pushing those from different speakers apart. Further, we introduce a prototypical graph CL to generalize SUR to unseen speakers, ensuring that the same speakers exhibit similar graph structures, while dissimilar ones differ. To further enhance model generalization, we introduce Uncertainty-based Generalization for Speakers, randomly sampling SUR statistics from the estimated Gaussian distribution and probabilistically replacing the original SUR. Experimental findings on two datasets highlight that our framework substantially improves the generalization of various MERC models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promising reasoning capabilities on text-rich images from charts, tables, and documents. However, the abundant text within such images may increase the model's sensitivity to language. This raises the need to evaluate LVLM performance on cross-lingual text-rich visual inputs, where the language in the image differs from the language of the instructions. To address this, we introduce XT-VQA (Cross-Lingual Text-Rich Visual Question Answering), a benchmark designed to assess how LVLMs handle language inconsistency between image text and questions. XT-VQA integrates five existing text-rich VQA datasets and a newly collected dataset, XPaperQA, covering diverse scenarios that require faithful recognition and comprehension of visual information despite language inconsistency. Our evaluation of prominent LVLMs on XT-VQA reveals a significant drop in performance for cross-lingual scenarios, even for models with multilingual capabilities. A mutual information analysis suggests that this performance gap stems from cross-lingual questions failing to adequately activate relevant visual information. To mitigate this issue, we propose MVCL-MI (Maximization of Vision-Language Cross-Lingual Mutual Information), where a visual-text cross-lingual alignment is built by maximizing mutual information between the model's outputs and visual information. This is achieved by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings through KL divergence minimization, where monolingual output logits serve as a teacher. Experimental results on the XT-VQA demonstrate that MVCL-MI effectively reduces the visual-text cross-lingual performance disparity while preserving the inherent capabilities of LVLMs, shedding new light on the potential practice for improving LVLMs.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in multilingual language understanding and generation. However, due to the imbalance in training data, their capabilities in non-English languages are limited. Recent studies revealed the English-pivot multilingual mechanism of LLMs, where LLMs implicitly convert non-English queries into English ones at the bottom layers and adopt English for thinking at the middle layers. However, due to the absence of explicit supervision for cross-lingual alignment in the intermediate layers of LLMs, the internal representations during these stages may become inaccurate. In this work, we introduce a deep supervision fine-tuning method (DFT) that incorporates additional supervision in the internal layers of the model to guide its workflow. Specifically, we introduce two training objectives on different layers of LLMs: one at the bottom layers to constrain the conversion of the target language into English, and another at the middle layers to constrain reasoning in English. To effectively achieve the guiding purpose, we designed two types of supervision signals: logits and feature, which represent a stricter constraint and a relatively more relaxed guidance. Our method guides the model to not only consider the final generated result when processing non-English inputs but also ensure the accuracy of internal representations. We conducted extensive experiments on typical English-centric large models, LLaMA-2 and Gemma-2, and the results on multiple multilingual datasets show that our method significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods.",

      "abstract": "Graph-theoretic problems arise in real-world applications like logistics, communication networks, and traffic optimization. These problems are often complex, noisy, and irregular, posing challenges for traditional algorithms. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential solutions but face challenges, including limited accuracy and input length constraints. To address these challenges, we propose MA-GTS (Multi-Agent Graph Theory Solver), a multi-agent framework that decomposes these complex problems through agent collaboration. MA-GTS maps the implicitly expressed text-based graph data into clear, structured graph representations and dynamically selects the most suitable algorithm based on problem constraints and graph structure scale. This approach ensures that the solution process remains efficient and the resulting reasoning path is interpretable. We validate MA-GTS using the G-REAL dataset, a real-world-inspired graph theory dataset we created. Experimental results show that MA-GTS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, with strong results across multiple benchmarks (G-REAL 94.2%, GraCoRe 96.9%, NLGraph 98.4%).MA-GTS is open-sourced at https://github.com/ZIKEYUAN/MA-GTS.git.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved significant success in generative tasks. However, their training and sampling processes suffer from the issue of distribution mismatch. During the denoising process, the input data distributions differ between the training and inference stages, potentially leading to inaccurate data generation. To obviate this, we analyze the training objective of DPMs and theoretically demonstrate that this mismatch can be alleviated through Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which is equivalent to performing robustness-driven Adversarial Training (AT) on DPMs. Furthermore, for the recently proposed Consistency Model (CM), which distills the inference process of the DPM, we prove that its training objective also encounters the mismatch issue. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by AT as well. Based on these insights, we propose to conduct efficient AT on both DPM and CM. Finally, extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of AT in diffusion-based models. The code is available at https://github.com/kugwzk/AT_Diff.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied in question answering over scientific research papers. To enhance the professionalism and accuracy of responses, many studies employ external knowledge augmentation. However, existing structures of external knowledge in scientific literature often focus solely on either paper entities or domain concepts, neglecting the intrinsic connections between papers through shared domain concepts. This results in less comprehensive and specific answers when addressing questions that combine papers and concepts. To address this, we propose a novel knowledge graph framework that captures deep conceptual relations between academic papers, constructing a relational network via intra-paper semantic elements and inter-paper citation relations. Using a few-shot knowledge graph construction method based on LLM, we develop NLP-AKG, an academic knowledge graph for the NLP domain, by extracting 620,353 entities and 2,271,584 relations from 60,826 papers in ACL Anthology. Based on this, we propose a 'sub-graph community summary' method and validate its effectiveness on three NLP scientific literature question answering datasets.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to leverage the complementary information from multiple modalities for affective understanding of user-generated videos. Existing methods mainly focused on designing sophisticated feature fusion strategies to integrate the separately extracted multimodal representations, ignoring the interference of the information irrelevant to sentiment. In this paper, we propose to disentangle the unimodal representations into sentiment-specific and sentiment-independent features, the former of which are fused for the MSA task. Specifically, we design a novel Sentiment-aware Disentangled Representation Shifting framework, termed SDRS, with two components. <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Interactive sentiment-aware representation disentanglement</b> aims to extract sentiment-specific feature representations for each nonverbal modality by considering the contextual influence of other modalities with the newly developed cross-attention autoencoder. <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Attentive cross-modal representation shifting</b> tries to shift the textual representation in a latent token space using the nonverbal sentiment-specific representations after projection. The shifted representation is finally employed to fine-tune a pre-trained language model for multimodal sentiment analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets, i.e., CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDRS framework not only obtains state-of-the-art results based solely on multimodal labels but also outperforms the methods that additionally require the labels of each modality.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is increasingly viewed as a foundational methodology for advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, its interpretability remains limited, and it often underperforms in certain fields due to its lack of human-like characteristics. Consequently, leveraging insights from Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) to understand and advance DL has become a focal point for researchers in the DL community. However, BCS is a diverse discipline where existing studies often concentrate on cognitive theories within their respective domains. These theories are typically grounded in certain assumptions, complicating comparisons between different approaches. Therefore, this review is intended to provide a comprehensive landscape of more than 300 papers on the intersection of DL and BCS grounded in DL community. Unlike previous reviews that based on sub-disciplines of Cognitive Science, this article aims to establish a unified framework encompassing all aspects of DL inspired by BCS, offering insights into the symbiotic relationship between DL and BCS. Additionally, we present a forward-looking perspective on future research directions, with the intention of inspiring further advancements in AI research.",

Thus, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) between different modalities is an important and challenging task. In this paper, we present a method that combines semantic information guidance and output space feature alignment for unsupervised domain adaptation. It utilizes low-level edge information and foreground region information as guidance to assist the segmentation network in learning domain-invariant features. Subsequently, adversarial learning is employed for cross-domain alignment in the output space, effectively achieving cross-modality segmentation of spine MRI. Testing on public datasets demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on all three metrics, exhibiting superior segmentation accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The in-image machine translation task involves translating text embedded within images, with the translated results presented in image format. While this task has numerous applications in various scenarios such as film poster translation and everyday scene image translation, existing methods frequently neglect the aspect of consistency throughout this process. We propose the need to uphold two types of consistency in this task: translation consistency and image generation consistency. The former entails incorporating image information during translation, while the latter involves maintaining consistency between the style of the text-image and the original image, ensuring background integrity. To address these consistency requirements, we introduce a novel two-stage framework named HCIIT (High-Consistency In-Image Translation) which involves text-image translation using a multimodal multilingual large language model in the first stage and image backfilling with a diffusion model in the second stage. Chain of thought learning is utilized in the first stage to enhance the model's ability to leverage image information during translation. Subsequently, a diffusion model trained for style-consistent text-image generation ensures uniformity in text style within images and preserves background details. A dataset comprising 400,000 style-consistent pseudo text-image pairs is curated for model training. Results obtained on both curated test sets and authentic image test sets validate the effectiveness of our framework in ensuring consistency and producing high-quality translated images.",

Beyond the constraints of any specific non-linguistic modality, Omni-MLLMs map various non-linguistic modalities into the embedding space of LLMs and enable the interaction and understanding of arbitrary combinations of modalities within a single model. In this paper, we systematically investigate relevant research and provide a comprehensive survey of Omni-MLLMs. Specifically, we first explain the four core components of Omni-MLLMs for unified multi-modal modeling with a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives. Then, we introduce the effective integration achieved through two-stage training and discuss the corresponding datasets as well as evaluation. Furthermore, we summarize the main challenges of current Omni-MLLMs and outline future directions. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and promotes the advancement of related research. Resources will be made public.",

Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) represent advanced AI systems with exceptional language processing capabilities. However, their effectiveness depends on the use of appropriate prompts. The design of suitable prompts specifically for analyzing mental health issues remains underexplored. Drawing inspiration from psychiatrists who use psychiatric scales to assess mental health, we have developed scale-based chains of thought (Scale-CoT) prompts. These not only enhance the LLMs’ ability to detect mental health issues but also increase clarity and explainability by integrating professional scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the knowledge generated by LLMs can be effectively transferred to smaller models, resulting in a better-performing and more lightweight system. Our approach, which leverages psychiatric scales, outperforms existing methods. Our experiments indicate that combining traditional psychiatry with computational techniques is worthwhile and deserving of further research and exploration.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining widespread attention for their potential across various fields, particularly within the medical domain. Recent efforts have aimed to privatize general-domain LLMs into specialized medical-domain LLMs by feeding high-quality, medical-domain training data. However, an overlooked aspect in these privatization efforts is the Dual Logic Ability of LLMs. This ability enables LLMs to comprehend pairs of logically opposed questions, ensuring stance consistency in their responses. In our study, we investigate two primary questions: Q1. How does privatization affect the dual logic ability of LLMs? Q2. How can we maintain the robustness of LLMs’ dual logic ability after privatization? To explore these questions, we first constructed a medical-domain dual logic ability evaluation dataset comprising logically opposed question pairs, created manually by NLP experts. By examining the stance consistency in responses to logically opposed question pairs, our analysis demonstrates a significant decline in the dual logic ability of LLMs after privatization. Furthermore, we construct privatization data to investigate the effects of the pre-training and instruction fine-tuning stages on the dual logic ability of LLMs. Interestingly, our findings reveal that the instruction fine-tuning stage often inadvertently compromises the LLMs’ dual logic ability although it is not the trainers’ intention. To counteract this, we incorporated general-domain dual logic data derived from basic science during the instruction fine-tuning stage, which are automatically constructed by our designed pipeline. Experiment results show that privatized LLMs can generalize dual logic ability from general-domain dual logic data, leading to their enhanced performance in the medical domain. Our study underscores the importance of prioritizing LLMs’ dual logic ability during the privatization process and establishes a benchmark for future research.

      "abstract": "As a fine-grained task, multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) mainly focuses on identifying aspect-level sentiment information in the text-image pair. However, we observe that it is difficult to recognize the sentiment of aspects in low-quality samples, such as those with low-resolution images that tend to contain noise. And in the real world, the quality of data usually varies for different samples, such noise is called data uncertainty. But previous works for the MABSA task treat different quality samples with the same importance and ignored the influence of data uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel data uncertainty-aware multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis approach, UA-MABSA, which weighted the loss of different samples by the data quality and difficulty. UA-MABSA adopts a novel quality assessment strategy that takes into account both the image quality and the aspect-based cross-modal relevance, thus enabling the model to pay more attention to high-quality and challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Twitter-2015 dataset. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the quality assessment strategy.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition. Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "LLMs' performance on complex tasks is still unsatisfactory. A key issue is that presently LLMs learn in a data-driven schema, while the instructions about these complex tasks are both scarce and hard to collect or construct. On the contrary, a prominent phenomenon is that LLMs can learn rather fast on simpler tasks with adequate prior knowledge captured during pretraining stage. Thus, if the prerequisite and mechanism of such rapid generalization could be elucidated, it could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the LLM's ability to learn complex tasks. Thus, in this paper, we employ a gradient-based method, to dissect the process that the SFT process adapts LLMs to downstream tasks via the perspective of attention patterns. We find that: (1) LLMs selectively activate task-specific attention heads during SFT; (2) activation patterns for complex tasks are combinations of basic task patterns; and (3) changes in a few parameters can significantly impact activation patterns after SFT on a small number of samples.Based on these insights, experiments are conducted to actually enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of SFT.",

      "abstract": "The colossal parameters and computational overhead of Large Language Models (LLMs) challenge their real-world applications. Network pruning, which targets unstructured or structured sparsity by removing redundant parameters, has recently been explored for LLM acceleration. Existing LLM pruning works focus on unstructured pruning, which typically requires special hardware support for a practical speed-up. In contrast, structured pruning can reduce latency on general devices. However, it remains a challenge to perform structured pruning efficiently and maintain performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. To this end, we introduce an efficient structured pruning framework named CFSP, which leverages both Coarse (interblock) and Fine-grained (intrablock) activation information as an importance criterion to guide pruning. The pruning is highly efficient, as it only requires one forward pass to compute feature activations. Specifically, we first allocate the sparsity budget across blocks based on their importance and then retain important weights within each block. In addition, we introduce a recovery fine-tuning strategy that adaptively allocates training overhead based on coarse-grained importance to further improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CFSP outperforms existing methods on diverse models across various sparsity budgets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wyxscir/CFSP.",

      "abstract": "Arteriosclerotic cerebral small vessel disease (aCSVD) is a major cause of stroke and dementia. Although its underlying pathogenesis remains poorly understood, both inflammaging and gut microbiota dysbiosis have been hypothesized to play significant roles. This study investigated the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of aCSVD through a comparative analysis of the gut microbiome and metabolome between CSVD patients and healthy controls. The results showed that patients with aCSVD exhibited a marked reduction in potentially beneficial bacterial species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzli and Roseburia intestinalis, alongside an increase in taxa from Bacteroides and Proteobacteria. Integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that alterations in microbial metabolic pathways, including LPS biosynthesis and phenylalanine-tyrosine metabolism, were associated with the status of aCSVD. Our findings indicated that microbial LPS biosynthesis and phenylalanine-tyrosine metabolism potentially influenced the symptoms and progression of aCSVD via pro-inflammatory effect and modulation of systemic neurotransmitters, respectively. These results imply that gut microbiota characteristics may serve as indicators for early detection of aCSVD and as potential gut-directed therapeutic intervention target.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and demonstrate impressive generalization ability by mining and learning information from extensive unlabeled text. However, they still exhibit reasoning mistakes, often stemming from knowledge deficiencies, which can affect their trustworthiness and reliability. Although users can provide diverse and comprehensive queries, obtaining sufficient and effective feedback is demanding. Furthermore, evaluating LLMs comprehensively with limited labeled samples is difficult. This makes it a challenge to diagnose and remedy the deficiencies of LLMs through rich label-free user queries. To tackle this challenge, we propose a label-free curricular meaningful learning framework (LaMer). LaMer first employs relative entropy to automatically diagnose and quantify the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs in a label-free setting. Next, to remedy the diagnosed knowledge deficiencies, we apply curricular meaningful learning: first, we adopt meaningful learning to adaptively synthesize augmentation data according to the severity of the deficiencies, and then design a curricular deficiency remedy strategy to remedy the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs progressively. Experiments show that LaMer efficiently and effectively diagnoses and remedies knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, improving various LLMs across seven out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning and language understanding benchmarks, achieving comparable results to baselines with just 40\\% training data. LaMer even surpasses methods that rely on labeled datasets for deficiency diagnosis. In application, our label-free method can offer an effective knowledge deficiency diagnostic tool for efficient LLM development.",

      "abstract": "Given a text-image pair, Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) is the task of identifying and categorizing entities in the text. Most existing work performs named entity labeling directly using final token representations derived by fusing image and text representations. Although they achieve promising results, these work may fail to effectively exploit text and image modalities. This is because they neglect the difference in the role of the two modalities: text modality can detect the boundary of an entity, while image modality is introduced to disambiguate the category of the entity. Based on these findings, in this paper, we construct two auxiliary tasks based on the decomposition strategy and propose a multi-task framework for MNER. Specifically, we first decompose MNER into two auxiliary tasks: entity boundary detection task and entity category classification task. Here, the former treats only the text modality as input and outputs the boundary labels, since it can achieve satisfactory boundary results by itself. The latter uses two modalities to yield category labels where image modality is dedicated to disambiguating categories. These two auxiliary tasks allow the effective exploitation of text and image modalities and put them back into their respective roles. Then, we vectorize their results to improve entity recognition using label clues from auxiliary tasks. Finally, we fuse features from text and image modalities and label embeddings from auxiliary tasks to fulfill MNER. Experimental results on two widely used MNER datasets show that our framework can yield new SOTA performance.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks in general domains. However, LLMs sometimes generate responses with the hallucination about medical facts due to limited domain knowledge. Such shortcomings pose potential risks in the utilization of LLMs within medical contexts. To address this challenge, we propose knowledge-tuning, which leverages structured medical knowledge bases for the LLMs to grasp domain knowledge efficiently and facilitate trustworthy response generation. We also release cMedKnowQA, a Chinese medical knowledge question-answering dataset constructed from medical knowledge bases to assess the medical knowledge proficiency of LLMs. Experimental results show that the LLMs which are knowledge-tuned with cMedKnowQA can exhibit higher levels of accuracy in response generation compared with vanilla instruction-tuning and offer a new trustworthy way for the domain adaptation of LLMs. We release our code and data at https://github.com/SCIR-HI/Huatuo-Llama-Med-Chinese .",

      "abstract": "Evaluating the graph comprehension and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging and often incomplete. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on pure graph understanding, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across all graph types and detailed capability definitions. This paper presents GraCoRe, a benchmark for systematically assessing LLMs' graph comprehension and reasoning. GraCoRe uses a three-tier hierarchical taxonomy to categorize and test models on pure graph and heterogeneous graphs, subdividing capabilities into 10 distinct areas tested through 19 tasks. Our benchmark includes 11 datasets with 5,140 graphs of varying complexity. We evaluate four closed-source and eight open-source LLMs, conducting thorough analyses from both ability and task perspectives. Key findings reveal that OpenAI o1 model has amazing comprehension and reasoning capabilities, semantic enrichment enhances reasoning performance, node ordering impacts task success, and the ability to process longer texts does not necessarily improve graph comprehension or reasoning.GraCoRe is open-sourced at https://github.com/ZIKEYUAN/GraCoRe",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence predicts drug properties by encoding drug molecules, aiding in the rapid screening of candidates. Different molecular representations, such as SMILES and molecule graphs, contain complementary information for molecular encoding. Thus exploiting complementary information from different molecular representations is one of the research priorities in molecular encoding. Most existing methods for combining molecular multi-modalities only use molecular-level information, making it hard to encode intra-molecular alignment information between different modalities. To address this issue, we propose a multi-granularity fusion method that is MolFusion. The proposed MolFusion consists of two key components: (1) MolSim, a molecular-level encoding component that achieves molecular-level alignment between different molecular representations. and (2) AtomAlign, an atomic-level encoding component that achieves atomic-level alignment between different molecular representations. Experimental results show that MolFusion effectively utilizes complementary multimodal information, leading to significant improvements in performance across various classification and regression tasks.",

      "abstract": "Large language model unlearning has garnered increasing attention due to its potential to address security and privacy concerns, leading to extensive research in the field. However, much of this research has concentrated on instance-level unlearning, specifically targeting the removal of predefined instances containing sensitive content. This focus has left a significant gap in the exploration of full entity-level unlearning, which is critical in real-world scenarios such as copyright protection. To this end, we propose a novel task of Entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase entity-related knowledge from the target model completely. To thoroughly investigate this task, we systematically evaluate trending unlearning algorithms, revealing that current methods struggle to achieve effective entity-level unlearning. Then, we further explore the factors that influence the performance of the unlearning algorithms, identifying that knowledge coverage and the size of the forget set play pivotal roles. Notably, our analysis also uncovers that entities introduced through fine-tuning are more vulnerable to unlearning than pre-trained entities. These findings collectively offer valuable insights for advancing entity-level unlearning for LLMs.",

      "abstract": "The objective of suicide risk detection on social media is to identify individuals who may attempt suicide and determine their suicide risk level based on their online behavior. Although data-driven learning models have been used to predict suicide risk levels, these models often lack theoretical support and explanation from psychiatric research. To address this issue, we propose the incorporation of professional psychiatric scales into research to provide theoretical support and explanations for our model. Our proposed Scale-based Neural Network (SNN) architecture aims to extract content associated with scales from the posting history of social media users to predict their suicide risk level. Additionally, our approach provides scale-based explanations for the model's predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several strong baseline methods and highlights the potential of combining psychiatric scales and computational techniques to improve suicide risk detection.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance in various natural language reasoning tasks. However, they still struggle with performing first-order logic reasoning over formal logical theories expressed in natural language. This is because the previous LLMs-based reasoning systems have the theoretical incompleteness issue. As a result, it can only address a limited set of simple reasoning problems, which significantly decreases their generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, named Generalizable and Faithful Reasoner (GFaiR), which introduces the paradigm of resolution refutation. Resolution refutation has the capability to solve all first-order logic reasoning problems by extending reasoning rules and employing the principle of proof by contradiction, so our system's completeness can be improved by introducing resolution refutation. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms previous works by achieving state-of-the-art performances in complex scenarios while maintaining performances in simple scenarios. Besides, we observe that GFaiR is faithful to its reasoning process.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning is now widely used in drug discovery, providing significant acceleration and cost reduction. As the most fundamental building block, molecular representation is essential for predicting molecular properties to enable various downstream applications. Most existing methods attempt to incorporate more information to learn better representations. However, not all features are equally important for a specific task. Ignoring this would potentially compromise the training efficiency and predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, which treats language models as an agent and molecular pretraining models as a knowledge base. The agent accentuates task-relevant features in the molecular representation by understanding the natural language description of the task, just as a tailor customizes clothes for clients. Thus, we call this approach MolTailor. Evaluations demonstrate MolTailor's superior performance over baselines, validating the efficacy of enhancing relevance for molecular representation learning. This illustrates the potential of language model guided optimization to better exploit and unleash the capabilities of existing powerful molecular representation methods. Our code and appendix are available at https://github.com/SCIR-HI/MolTailor.",

      "abstract": "Prompt-based classification adapts tasks to a cloze question format utilizing the [MASK] token and the filled tokens are then mapped to labels through pre-defined verbalizers. Recent studies have explored the use of verbalizer embeddings to reduce labor in this process. However, all existing studies require a tuning process for either the pre-trained models or additional trainable embeddings. Meanwhile, the distance between high-dimensional verbalizer embeddings should not be measured by Euclidean distance due to the potential for non-linear manifolds in the representation space. In this study, we propose a tuning-free manifold-based space re-embedding method called Locally Linear Embedding with Intra-class Neighborhood Constraint (LLE-INC) for verbalizer embeddings, which preserves local properties within the same class as guidance for classification. Experimental results indicate that even without tuning any parameters, our LLE-INC is on par with automated verbalizers with parameter tuning. And with the parameter updating, our approach further enhances prompt-based tuning by up to 3.2%. Furthermore, experiments with the LLaMA-7B&amp;13B indicate that LLE-INC is an efficient tuning-free classification approach for the hyper-scale language models.",

      "abstract": "Large language models augmented with task-relevant documents have demonstrated impressive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, regarding how to obtain effective documents, the existing methods are mainly divided into two categories. One is to retrieve from an external knowledge base, and the other is to utilize large language models to generate documents. We propose an iterative retrieval-generation collaborative framework. It is not only able to leverage both parametric and non-parametric knowledge, but also helps to find the correct reasoning path through retrieval-generation interactions, which is very important for tasks that require multi-step reasoning. We conduct experiments on four question answering datasets, including single-hop QA and multi-hop QA tasks. Empirical results show that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of large language models and outperforms previous baselines.",

This paper proposes a general multilingual multitask model, named SkillNet-X, which enables a single model to tackle many different tasks from different languages. To this end, we define several language-specific skills and task-specific skills, each of which corresponds to a skill module. SkillNet-X sparsely activates parts of the skill modules which are relevant to eitherthe target task or the target language. Acting as knowledge transit hubs, skill modules are capable of absorbing task-related knowledge and language-related knowledge consecutively. We evaluate SkillNet-X on eleven natural language understanding datasets in four languages. Results show that SkillNet-X performs better than task-specific and two multitask learning baselines.To investigate the generalization of our model, we conduct experiments on two new tasks and find that SkillNet-X significantly outperforms baselines.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal relation extraction (MRE) requires the integration of multi-modal information to identify relationships between entities. Although fine-grained correlations between visual objects and textual words have the potential to improve cross-modal interaction, they are typically modeled implicitly and hindered by the modality gap. This paper introduces a novel method called relational Graph-Bridged cross-modal InTeraction (GBIT). GBIT aims to model fine-grained cross-modal correlations into the interaction process explicitly. This is achieved by constructing a fine-grained cross-modal relational graph, which acts as a bridge for effective cross-modal interaction in multiple layers. Within GBIT, a gated interaction strategy and an adaptive integration module are proposed for irrelevance-filtered information exchange and final information collation. Through extensive experiments on the benchmark MRE, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MRE.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive dynamics are pivotal to advance human understanding of the world. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) reveal their potential for cognitive simulation. However, these LLM-based cognitive studies primarily focus on static modeling, overlooking the dynamic nature of cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and present a corresponding task with the inspiration of longitudinal studies. Towards the task, we develop CogBench, a novel benchmark to assess the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and validate it through participant surveys. We also design two evaluation metrics for CogBench, including Authenticity and Rationality. Recognizing the inherent static nature of LLMs, we introduce CogGPT for the task, which features an innovative iterative cognitive mechanism aimed at enhancing lifelong cognitive dynamics. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CogGPT over existing methods, particularly in its ability to facilitate role-specific cognitive dynamics under continuous information flows.",

      "abstract": "Meeting summarization has emerged as a promising technique for providing users with condensed summaries. However, existing work has focused on training models on centralized data, neglecting real-world scenarios where meeting data are infeasible to collect centrally, due to their sensitive nature. This gap motivates us to explore federated learning for meeting summarization. Two critical challenges impede progress. First, state-of-the-art summarizers are based on parameter-heavy pre-trained models. Exchanging such a model's parameters across clients imposes large bandwidth costs. Second, as real-world meeting data belong to various domains and are distributed across clients, they are instances of non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID). IID assumptions do not hold, which changes which forms of learning algorithms best apply. To address this, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Adapter-based Federated Selective Knowledge Distillation</i> (<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AdaFedSelecKD</small>) for training performant client models. Specifically, we develop an adapter-based summarization model where two adapters cooperatively facilitate learning using fewer parameters to reduce communication costs. Then, we devise a selective knowledge distillation strategy, assisting clients in robustly handling domain-focused modelling on their own data, while leveraging global parameters based on non-IID data. Extensive experiments on the QMSum benchmark demonstrate <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AdaFedSelecKD</small> can achieve comparable performance with powerful centralized training methods, and shows its generalizability and robustness.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates a novel commonsense inference task that comprises reasoning about the subsequent events chains and probable consumption intents, given an event described in brief free-form text. For instance, given the event “ <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fall in love</i> ”, the system anticipates ensuing events such as “ <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">get married</i> ”→“ <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">be pregnant</i> ”→“ <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">have a baby</i> ”. Concurrently, the system predicts the likely consumption intents of the event participants, such as purchasing “ <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">jewelry</i> ”, “ <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">maternity clothing</i> ”, and “ <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">baby food</i> ”. The event chains generated in this process provide explicit, meaningful explanations, aiding the understanding of inferred consumption intents. To facilitate this study, we construct a new crowdsourced corpus: x-ECON. This corpus comprises 10,144 event chains and 150 event-related product categories, offering a wide range of everyday consumer events and situations. We introduce a baseline reasoning framework that not only infers consumption intent but also generates an event chain to explain its inference. Our experimental results suggest that involving the event chain reasoning in the event-consumption reasoning system can help improve the neural networks' reason about the probable consumption intents of the event participants. Additionally, our method demonstrates the applicability of our approach in improving the performance of recommendation systems, by highlighting the role of explainable commonsense inference on the consumption intent. We also evaluated the performance of ChatGPT on our x-ECON dataset, showing that explainable event-consumption commonsense reasoning is a challenging task for large language models.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made rapid progress for disease diagnosis and triage. In the field of ophthalmic diseases, image-based diagnosis has achieved high accuracy but still encounters limitations due to the lack of medical history. The emergence of ChatGPT enables human-computer interaction, allowing for the development of a multimodal AI system that integrates interactive text and image information. Objective To develop a multimodal AI system using ChatGPT and anterior segment images for diagnosing and triaging ophthalmic diseases. To assess the AI system's performance through a two-stage cross-sectional study, starting with silent evaluation and followed by early clinical evaluation in outpatient clinics. Methods and analysis Our study will be conducted across three distinct centers in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suqian. The development of the smartphone-based multimodal AI system will take place in Shanghai with the goal of achieving ≥90% sensitivity and ≥95% specificity for diagnosing and triaging ophthalmic diseases. The first stage of the cross-sectional study will explore the system's performance in Shanghai's outpatient clinics. Medical histories will be collected without patient interaction, and anterior segment images will be captured using slit lamp equipment. This stage aims for ≥85% sensitivity and ≥95% specificity with a sample size of 100 patients. The second stage will take place at three locations, with Shanghai serving as the internal validation dataset, and Nanjing and Suqian as the external validation dataset. Medical history will be collected through patient interviews, and anterior segment images will be captured via smartphone devices. An expert panel will establish reference standards and assess AI accuracy for diagnosis and triage throughout all stages. A one-vs.-rest strategy will be used for data analysis, and a post-hoc power calculation will be performed to evaluate the impact of disease types on AI performance. Discussion Our study may provide a user-friendly smartphone-based multimodal AI system for diagnosis and triage of ophthalmic diseases. This innovative system may support early detection of ocular abnormalities, facilitate establishment of a tiered healthcare system, and reduce the burdens on tertiary facilities. Trial registration The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on June 25th, 2023 (NCT 05930444).",

      "abstract": "Driven by curiosity, humans have continually sought to explore and understand the world around them, leading to the invention of various tools to satiate this inquisitiveness. Despite not having the capacity to process and memorize vast amounts of information in their brains, humans excel in critical thinking, planning, reflection, and harnessing available tools to interact with and interpret the world, enabling them to find answers efficiently. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest that machines might also possess the aforementioned human-like capabilities, allowing them to exhibit powerful abilities even with a constrained parameter count. In this paper, we introduce KwaiAgents, a generalized information-seeking agent system based on LLMs. Within KwaiAgents, we propose an agent system that employs LLMs as its cognitive core, which is capable of understanding a user's query, behavior guidelines, and referencing external documents. The agent can also update and retrieve information from its internal memory, plan and execute actions using a time-aware search-browse toolkit, and ultimately provide a comprehensive response. We further investigate the system's performance when powered by LLMs less advanced than GPT-4, and introduce the Meta-Agent Tuning (MAT) framework, designed to ensure even an open-sourced 7B or 13B model performs well among many agent systems. We exploit both benchmark and human evaluations to systematically validate these capabilities. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our agent system compared to other autonomous agents and highlight the enhanced generalized agent-abilities of our fine-tuned LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to determine the sentiment polarity of each aspect mentioned in the text based on multimodal content. Various approaches have been proposed to model multimodal sentiment features for each aspect via modal interactions. However, most existing approaches have two shortcomings: (1) The representation gap between textual and visual modalities may increase the risk of misalignment in modal interactions; (2) In some examples where the image is not related to the text, the visual information may not enrich the textual modality when learning aspect-based sentiment features. In such cases, blindly leveraging information from visual modal may introduce noises in reasoning the aspect-based sentiment expressions. To tackle the shortcomings mentioned above, we propose an end-to-end MABSA framework with image conversion and noise filtration. Specifically, to bridge the representation gap in different modalities, we attempt to translate images into the input space of a pre-trained language model (PLM). To this end, we develop an image-to-text conversion module that can convert an image to an implicit sequence of token embedding. Moreover, an aspect-oriented filtration module is devised to alleviate the noise in the implicit token embeddings, which consists of two attention operations. The former aims to create an enhanced aspect embedding as a query, and the latter seeks to use this query to retrieve relevant auxiliary information from the implicit token embeddings to supplement the textual content. After filtering the noise, we leverage a PLM to encode the text, aspect, and image prompt derived from filtered implicit token embeddings as sentiment features to perform aspect-based sentiment prediction. Experimental results on two MABSA datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the proposed framework has superior robustness and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit superior performance on various natural language tasks, but they are susceptible to issues stemming from outdated data and domain-specific limitations. In order to address these challenges, researchers have pursued two primary strategies, knowledge editing and retrieval augmentation, to enhance LLMs by incorporating external information from different aspects. Nevertheless, there is still a notable absence of a comprehensive survey. In this paper, we propose a review to discuss the trends in integration of knowledge and large language models, including taxonomy of methods, benchmarks, and applications. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of different methods and point out potential research directions in the future. We hope this survey offers the community quick access and a comprehensive overview of this research area, with the intention of inspiring future research endeavors.",

      "abstract": "Molecule discovery serves as a cornerstone in numerous scientific domains, fueling the development of new materials and innovative drug designs. Recent developments of in-silico molecule discovery have highlighted the promising results of cross-modal techniques, which bridge molecular structures with their descriptive annotations. However, these cross-modal methods frequently encounter the issue of data scarcity, hampering their performance and application. In this paper, we address the low-resource challenge by utilizing artificially-real data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We first introduce a retrieval-based prompting strategy to construct high-quality pseudo data, then explore the optimal method to effectively leverage this pseudo data. Experiments show that using pseudo data for domain adaptation outperforms all existing methods, while also requiring a smaller model scale, reduced data size and lower training cost, highlighting its efficiency. Furthermore, our method shows a sustained improvement as the volume of pseudo data increases, revealing the great potential of pseudo data in advancing low-resource cross-modal molecule discovery.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks in general domains. However, LLMs sometimes generate responses with the hallucination about medical facts due to limited domain knowledge. Such shortcomings pose potential risks in the utilization of LLMs within medical contexts. To address this challenge, we propose knowledge-tuning, which leverages structured medical knowledge bases for the LLMs to grasp domain knowledge efficiently and facilitate reliable response generation. We also release cMedKnowQA, a Chinese medical knowledge question-answering dataset constructed from medical knowledge bases to assess the medical knowledge proficiency of LLMs. Experimental results show that the LLMs which are knowledge-tuned with cMedKnowQA, can exhibit higher levels of accuracy in response generation compared with vanilla instruction-tuning and offer a new reliable way for the domain adaptation of LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained models have achieved success in Chinese Short Text Matching (STM) tasks, but they often rely on superficial clues, leading to a lack of robust predictions. To address this issue, it is crucial to analyze and mitigate the influence of superficial clues on STM models. Our study aims to investigate their over-reliance on the edit distance feature, commonly used to measure the semantic similarity of Chinese text pairs, which can be considered a superficial clue. To mitigate STM models' over-reliance on superficial clues, we propose a novel resampling training strategy called Gradually Learn Samples Containing Superficial Clue (GLS-CSC). Through comprehensive evaluations of In-Domain (I.D.), Robustness (Rob.), and Out-Of-Domain (O.O.D.) test sets, we demonstrate that GLS-CSC outperforms existing methods in terms of enhancing the robustness and generalization of Chinese STM models. Moreover, we conduct a detailed analysis of existing methods and reveal their commonality.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has revealed that deep neural networks often take dataset biases as a shortcut to make decisions rather than understand tasks, leading to failures in real-world applications. In this study, we focus on the spurious correlation between word features and labels that models learn from the biased data distribution of training data. In particular, we define the word highly co-occurring with a specific label as biased word, and the example containing biased word as biased example. Our analysis shows that biased examples are easier for models to learn, while at the time of prediction, biased words make a significantly higher contribution to the models' predictions, and models tend to assign predicted labels over-relying on the spurious correlation between words and labels. To mitigate models' over-reliance on the shortcut (i.e. spurious correlation), we propose a training strategy Less-Learn-Shortcut (LLS): our strategy quantifies the biased degree of the biased examples and down-weights them accordingly. Experimental results on Question Matching, Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks show that LLS is a task-agnostic strategy and can improve the model performance on adversarial data while maintaining good performance on in-domain data.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic scene graph generation aims to identify visual relationships (subject-predicate-object) in frames based on spatio-temporal contextual information in the video. Previous work implicitly models the spatio-temporal interaction simultaneously, which leads to entanglement of spatio-temporal contextual information. To this end, we propose a Grafting-Then-Reassembling framework (GTR), which explicitly extracts intra-frame spatial information and inter-frame temporal information in two separate stages to decouple spatio-temporal contextual information. Specifically, we first graft a static scene graph generation model to generate static visual relationships within frames. Then we propose the temporal dependency model to extract the temporal dependencies across frames, and explicitly reassemble static visual relationships into dynamic scene graphs. Experimental results show that GTR achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Further analyses reveal that the reassembling stage is crucial to the success of our framework.",

      "abstract": "Excessive stress levels can lead to fluctuations in pilot operating techniques, decreased quality of work, increased errors, impulsive behavior, and communication difficulties, resulting in reduced pilot coping ability to the environment, behavioral disorders, and flight accidents. The purpose of this study is to analyze the cerebral blood oxygen characteristics of pilots before and after stress and the relationship between this characteristic and their antiglare performance by functional near-infrared techniques (fNIRs), and to establish an index for the evaluation of pilots' stress response. A total of 15 pilots were recruited in this study, and the stress of the pilots was induced by spin ladder training, while the cerebral blood oxygen of the pilots was collected simultaneously by fNIRs. It was found that the difference in HbO<sub>2</sub> between the left and right brain regions was significantly different before and after the stress stimulation caused by spin-ladder training, and the difference in HbO<sub>2</sub> was elevated by 0.072 (p &lap; 0.05) after the stimulation. In contrast, the difference in Hb decreased by 0.068 (p &lap; 0.05) after the stimulation. Furthermore, the value of the change in HbO<sub>2</sub> showed a significant negative correlation with the level of anti-vertigo in the subjects: r = -0.925, p &lap; 0.01. The results of this study can be used to indicate the level of rotational stress in pilots and to predict and assess the anti-glare potential of flight trainees.",

      "abstract": "Although large-scale video-language pre-training models, which usually build a global alignment between the video and the text, have achieved remarkable progress on various downstream tasks, the idea of adopting fine-grained information during the pre-training stage is not well explored. In this work, we propose STOA-VLP, a pre-training framework that jointly models object and action information across spatial and temporal dimensions. More specifically, the model regards object trajectories across frames and multiple action features from the video as fine-grained features. Besides, We design two auxiliary tasks to better incorporate both kinds of information into the pre-training process of the video-language model. The first is the dynamic object-text alignment task, which builds a better connection between object trajectories and the relevant noun tokens. The second is the spatial-temporal action set prediction, which guides the model to generate consistent action features by predicting actions found in the text. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks (video captioning, text-video retrieval, and video question answering) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed STOA-VLP (e.g. 3.7 Rouge-L improvements on MSR-VTT video captioning benchmark, 2.9% accuracy improvements on MSVD video question answering benchmark, compared to previous approaches).",

      "abstract": "Causal Emotion Entailment aims to identify causal utterances that are responsible for the target utterance with a non-neutral emotion in conversations. Previous works are limited in thorough understanding of the conversational context and accurate reasoning of the emotion cause. To this end, we propose Knowledge-Bridged Causal Interaction Network (KBCIN) with commonsense knowledge (CSK) leveraged as three bridges. Specifically, we construct a conversational graph for each conversation and leverage the event-centered CSK as the semantics-level bridge (S-bridge) to capture the deep inter-utterance dependencies in the conversational context via the CSK-Enhanced Graph Attention module. Moreover, social-interaction CSK serves as emotion-level bridge (E-bridge) and action-level bridge (A-bridge) to connect candidate utterances with the target one, which provides explicit causal clues for the Emotional Interaction module and Actional Interaction module to reason the target emotion. Experimental results show that our model achieves better performance over most baseline models. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/circle-hit/KBCIN.",

      "abstract": "Understanding temporal commonsense concepts, such as times of occurrence and durations is crucial for event-centric language understanding. Reasoning about such temporal concepts in a complex context requires reasoning over both the stated context and the world knowledge that underlines it. A recent study shows massive pre-trained LM still struggle with such temporal reasoning under complex contexts (e.g., dialog) because they only implicitly encode the relevant contexts and fail to explicitly uncover the underlying logical compositions for complex inference, thus may not be robust enough. In this work, we propose to augment LMs with the temporal logic induction ability, which frames the temporal reasoning by defining three modular components: temporal dependency inducer and temporal concept defuzzifier and logic validator. The former two components disentangle the explicit/implicit dependency between temporal concepts across context (before, after, ...) and the specific meaning of fuzzy temporal concepts, respectively, while the validator combines the intermediate reasoning clues for robust contextual reasoning about the temporal concepts. Extensive experimental results on TIMEDIAL, a challenging dataset for temporal reasoning over dialog, show that our method, Logic Induction Enhanced Contextualized TEmporal Reasoning (LECTER), can yield great improvements over the traditional language model for temporal reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Despite achieving remarkable performance on various vision-language tasks, Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from redundancy in inputs and parameters, significantly hampering their efficiency in real-world applications. Moreover, the degree of redundancy in token representations and model parameters, such as attention heads, varies significantly for different inputs. In light of the challenges, we propose SmartTrim, an adaptive acceleration framework for VLMs, which adjusts the computational overhead per instance. Specifically, we integrate lightweight modules into the original backbone to identify and prune redundant token representations and attention heads within each layer. Furthermore, we devise a self-distillation strategy to enhance the consistency between the predictions of the pruned model and its fully-capacity counterpart. Experimental results across various vision-language tasks consistently demonstrate that SmartTrim accelerates the original model by 2-3 times with minimal performance degradation, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous approaches. Code will be available at https://github.com/kugwzk/SmartTrim.",

      "abstract": "Vision-and-language (VL) pre-training, which aims to learn a general representation of image-text pairs that can be transferred to various vision-and-language tasks. Compared with modeling uni-modal data, the main challenge of the VL model is: how to learn the cross-modal interaction from multimodal data, especially the fine-grained interaction. Existing works have shown that fully transformer-based models that adopt attention mechanisms to learn in-layer cross-model interaction can demonstrate impressive performance on various cross-modal downstream tasks. However, they ignored that the semantic information of the different modals at the same layer was not uniform, which leads to the cross-modal interaction collapsing into a limited multi-modal semantic information interaction. In this work, we propose the UNIMO-3 model, which has the capacity to simultaneously learn the multimodal in-layer interaction and cross-layer interaction. UNIMO-3 model can establish effective connections between different layers in a cross-modal encoder, and adaptively capture the interaction between two modalities at different levels. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks, and through ablation study can prove that effective cross-layer learning improves the model's ability of multimodal representation.",

      "abstract": "Surrounded by structured data, such as medical data, financial data, knowledge bases, etc., data-to-text generation has become an important natural language processing task that can help people better understand the meaning of those data by providing them with user-friendly text. Existing methods for data-to-text generation show promising results in tackling two major challenges: content planning and surface realization, which transform structured data into fluent text. However, they lack an iterative refinement process for generating text, which can enable the model to perfect the text step-by-step while accepting control over the process. In this paper, we explore enhancing data-to-text generation with an iterative refinement process via diffusion. We have four main contributions: (1) we use the diffusion model to improve the prefix tuning for data-to-text generation; (2) we propose a look-ahead guiding loss to supervise the iterative refinement process for better text generation; (3) we extract content plans from reference text and propose a planning-then-writing pipeline to give the model content planning ability; and (4) we conducted experiments on three data-to-text generation datasets and both automatic evaluation criteria (BLEU, NIST, METEOR, ROUGEL, CIDEr, TER, MoverScore, BLEURT, and BERTScore) and human evaluation criteria (Quality and Naturalness) show the effectiveness of our model. Our model can improve the competitive prefix tuning method by 2.19% in terms of a widely-used automatic evaluation criterion BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) on WebNLG dataset with GPT-2 Large as the pretrained language model backbone. Human evaluation criteria also show that our model can improve the quality and naturalness of the generated text across all three datasets.",

      "abstract": "Emotion Forecasting in Conversations (EFC), the task aims to predict the emotion of next utterance (yet to come), has received more and more attention in recent years. However, this task ignores the one-to-many feature of dialogue and its prediction target is emotion label, which is flawed in most cases. In this work, we propose a new task: Emotion Distribution Forecasting in Conversations (EDFC), which aims to predict the emotion distribution of next utterance. Although this task is more reasonable in real applications, it can only learn using emotion labels in most cases because of the difficulty in obtaining emotion distribution. To address it, we explore the positive role of topic in this task and propose a topic-enhanced approach. Specifically, we first obtain the topic-based emotion distribution prior through topic model and emotion generation model, and then use the emotion distribution prior to enhance original label learning model. To effectively evaluate the distribution prediction results, we construct two datasets for this task, and the experimental results prove the feasibility of the EDFC task as well as the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Action item detection aims at recognizing sentences containing information about actionable tasks, which can help people quickly grasp core tasks in the meeting without going through the redundant meeting contents. Therefore, in this paper, we thoroughly describe our carefully designed solution for the Action Item Detection Track of the General Meeting Understanding and Generation (MUG) challenge in the ICASSP 2023 Signal Processing Grand Challenge. Specifically, we systematically analyze the task instances provided by MUG and find that the key ingredient for successful action item detection is leveraging the dialogue context information into consideration. To this end, we design a simple and effective method for modelling context and utterance information concurrently. The experimental results show our method achieves remarkable improvements over baseline models, with an absolute increase of 0.62 of the F <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf> score on the validation set. The stable generalizability of our method is further verified by our score on the final test set <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> .",

Specifically, the generative agent architecture comprising several meticulously designed modules constitutes the most critical component. To facilitate progress in this research, this report presents our integrated perspective on comprehending generative agents through summarization, since we believe summarization is the most fundamental and indispensable capacity of generative agents manifested across diverse scenarios. We hope this report can provide insight into understanding the importance of summarization capacity in generative agents and motivate future research.",

The study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT on emotional dialogue understanding and generation through a series of experiments on several downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that while ChatGPT's performance on emotional dialogue understanding may still lag behind that of supervised models, it exhibits promising results in generating emotional responses. Furthermore, the study suggests potential avenues for future research directions.",

Nevertheless, LLMs have not yet performed optimally in biomedical domain tasks due to the need for medical expertise in the responses. In response to this challenge, we propose HuaTuo, a LLaMA-based model that has been supervised-fine-tuned with generated QA (Question-Answer) instances. The experimental results demonstrate that HuaTuo generates responses that possess more reliable medical knowledge. Our proposed HuaTuo model is accessible at https://github.com/SCIR-HI/Huatuo-Llama-Med-Chinese.",

We present Hansel, a new benchmark in Chinese that fills the vacancy of non-English few-shot and zero-shot EL challenges. The test set of Hansel is human annotated and reviewed, created with a novel method for collecting zero-shot EL datasets. It covers 10K diverse documents in news, social media posts and other web articles, with Wikidata as its target Knowledge Base. We demonstrate that the existing state-of-the-art EL system performs poorly on Hansel ([email protected] of 36.6% on Few-Shot). We then establish a strong baseline that scores a [email protected] of 46.2% on Few-Shot and 76.6% on Zero-Shot on our dataset. We also show that our baseline achieves competitive results on TAC-KBP2015 Chinese Entity Linking task. Datasets and codes are released at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Hansel.",

      "abstract": "The current‐limiting reactor is currently the most used fault current limiting technique to ensure the fault ride‐through of the multi‐terminal dc grid. However, its configuration will significantly prolong the fault current clearance time and increase the dissipated energy of dc circuit breakers. Therefore, this paper proposes a cost‐effective multiline fault current limiter for multiport application in multi‐terminal dc grids, which can effectively limit the rising speed of fault current through the integrated current‐limiting reactors without time delay and significantly reduce their negative impacts on the performance of dc circuit breakers by bypassing the current‐limiting reactors through the solid‐state switch units during the fault current interruption process. The topology and operation process of the multiline fault current limiter are introduced at first. Then, the economic comparison of the proposed device with the existing solutions is presented. Finally, the feasibility and superiorities of the proposed device are verified by extensive simulations and scaled‐down experiments. © 2023 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography-to-Text generation (EEG-to-Text), which aims to directly generate natural text from EEG signals has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to the enormous potential for Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the remarkable discrepancy between the subject-dependent EEG representation and the semantic-dependent text representation poses a great challenge to this task. To mitigate this challenge, we devise a Curriculum Semantic-aware Contrastive Learning strategy (C-SCL), which effectively re-calibrates the subject-dependent EEG representation to the semantic-dependent EEG representation, thus reducing the discrepancy. Specifically, our C-SCL pulls semantically similar EEG representations together while pushing apart dissimilar ones. Besides, in order to introduce more meaningful contrastive pairs, we carefully employ curriculum learning to not only craft meaningful contrastive pairs but also make the learning progressively. We conduct extensive experiments on the ZuCo benchmark and our method combined with diverse models and architectures shows stable improvements across three types of metrics while achieving the new state-of-the-art. Further investigation proves not only its superiority in both the single-subject and low-resource settings but also its robust generalizability in the zero-shot setting.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, adolescents would like to share their daily lives via social media platforms, which presents an excellent opportunity for us to leverage these data to develop techniques to measure their mental health status, such as depression. Previous researches focus on the more accurate detection of depression through statistical learning and ignore psychological understanding of depression. However, psychologists have given lots of theoretical evidence for depression. Such as according to cognitive psychology research, cognitive distortions will result in depression. Thus, in this study, we propose a new task, explainable depression detection, to not only automatically detect depression but also try to give clues to depression based on cognitive distortion theory. For this purpose, we construct a multi-task learning model based on a pre-trained model to detect depression and identify cognitive distortion. And we use many analytical means including word clouds for data analysis to draw our conclusion. Previous social media users' depression corpus and our cognitive distortion corpus are utilized for analysis and experiment. Our experimental results outperform the baseline results and interesting conclusions about adolescent depression are drawn.",

      "abstract": "The facts and time in the document are intricately intertwined, making temporal reasoning over documents challenging. Previous work models time implicitly, making it difficult to handle such complex relationships. To address this issue, we propose MTGER, a novel Multi-view Temporal Graph Enhanced Reasoning framework for temporal reasoning over time-involved documents. Concretely, MTGER explicitly models the temporal relationships among facts by multi-view temporal graphs. On the one hand, the heterogeneous temporal graphs explicitly model the temporal and discourse relationships among facts; on the other hand, the multi-view mechanism captures both time-focused and fact-focused information, allowing the two views to complement each other through adaptive fusion. To further improve the implicit reasoning capability of the model, we design a self-supervised time-comparing objective. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the TimeQA and SituatedQA datasets. Furthermore, MTGER gives more consistent answers under question perturbations.",

      "abstract": "Explaining black-box model behavior with natural language has achieved impressive results in various NLP tasks. Recent research has explored the utilization of subsequences from the input text as a rationale, providing users with evidence to support the model decision. Although existing frameworks excel in generating high-quality rationales while achieving high task performance, they neglect to account for the unreliable link between the generated rationale and model decision. In simpler terms, a model may make correct decisions while attributing wrong rationales, or make poor decisions while attributing correct rationales. To mitigate this issue, we propose a unified two-stage framework known as Self-Attribution and Decision-Making (SADM). Through extensive experiments on five reasoning datasets from the ERASER benchmark, we demonstrate that our framework not only establishes a more reliable link between the generated rationale and model decision but also achieves competitive results in task performance and the quality of rationale. Furthermore, we explore the potential of our framework in semi-supervised scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Decoding text stimuli from cognitive signals (e.g. fMRI) enhances our understanding of the human language system, paving the way for building versatile Brain-Computer Interface. However, existing studies largely focus on decoding individual word-level fMRI volumes from a restricted vocabulary, which is far too idealized for real-world application. In this paper, we propose fMRI2text, the first open-vocabulary task aiming to bridge fMRI time series and human language. Furthermore, to explore the potential of this new task, we present a baseline solution, UniCoRN: the Unified Cognitive Signal ReconstructioN for Brain Decoding. By reconstructing both individual time points and time series, UniCoRN establishes a robust encoder for cognitive signals (fMRI & EEG). Leveraging a pre-trained language model as decoder, UniCoRN proves its efficacy in decoding coherent text from fMRI series across various split settings. Our model achieves a 34.77% BLEU score on fMRI2text, and a 37.04% BLEU when generalized to EEG-to-text decoding, thereby surpassing the former baseline. Experimental results indicate the feasibility of decoding consecutive fMRI volumes, and the effectiveness of decoding different cognitive signals using a unified structure.",

      "abstract": "Event skeleton generation, aiming to induce an event schema skeleton graph with abstracted event nodes and their temporal relations from a set of event instance graphs, is a critical step in the temporal complex event schema induction task. Existing methods effectively address this task from a graph generation perspective but suffer from noise-sensitive and error accumulation, e.g., the inability to correct errors while generating schema. We, therefore, propose a novel Diffusion Event Graph Model (DEGM) to address these issues. Our DEGM is the first workable diffusion model for event skeleton generation, where the embedding and rounding techniques with a custom edge-based loss are introduced to transform a discrete event graph into learnable latent representations. Furthermore, we propose a denoising training process to maintain the model’s robustness. Consequently, DEGM derives the final schema, where error correction is guaranteed by iteratively refining the latent representations during the schema generation process. Experimental results on three IED bombing datasets demonstrate that our DEGM achieves better results than other state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zhufq00/EventSkeletonGeneration.",

However, the best-performing approach considers historically generated results as flattened memory cells, ignoring the fact that not all preceding images contribute equally to the generation of the characters and scenes at the current stage. To address this, we present a simple method that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story. We evaluate our model on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on both story visualization and continuation scenarios.We conduct detailed model analysis and show that our model excels at generating semantically consistent images for stories.",

      "abstract": "Multilingual neural machine translation has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years. However, the long-tailed distribution of multilingual corpora poses a challenge of Pareto optimization, i.e., optimizing for some languages may come at the cost of degrading the performance of others.Existing balancing training strategies are equivalent to a series of Pareto optimal solutions, which trade off on a Pareto frontierIn Pareto optimization, Pareto optimal solutions refer to solutions in which none of the objectives can be improved without sacrificing at least one of the other objectives. The set of all Pareto optimal solutions forms a Pareto frontier..In this work, we propose a new training framework, Pareto Mutual Distillation (Pareto-MD), towards pushing the Pareto frontier outwards rather than making trade-offs.Specifically, Pareto-MD collaboratively trains two Pareto optimal solutions that favor different languages and allows them to learn from the strengths of each other via knowledge distillation.Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to enable stronger communication between Pareto optimal solutions and broaden the applicability of our approach. Experimental results on the widely-used WMT and TED datasets show that our method significantly pushes the Pareto frontier and outperforms baselines by up to +2.46 BLEUOur code will be released upon acceptance..",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in various applications, but they still face various inconsistency issues. Existing works primarily focus on the inconsistency issues within a single LLM, while we complementarily explore the inter-consistency among multiple LLMs for collaboration. To examine whether LLMs can collaborate effectively to achieve a consensus for a shared goal, we focus on commonsense reasoning, and introduce a formal debate framework (FORD) to conduct a three-stage debate among LLMs with real-world scenarios alignment: fair debate, mismatched debate, and roundtable debate. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, LLMs can effectively collaborate to reach a consensus despite noticeable inter-inconsistencies, but imbalances in their abilities can lead to domination by superior LLMs. Leveraging a more advanced LLM like GPT-4 as an authoritative judge can boost collaboration performance. Our work contributes to understanding the inter-consistency among LLMs and lays the foundation for developing future collaboration methods. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/Waste-Wood/FORD.",

      "abstract": "Causal reasoning ability is crucial for numerous NLP applications. Despite the impressive emerging ability of ChatGPT in various NLP tasks, it is unclear how well ChatGPT performs in causal reasoning. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the ChatGPT's causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that ChatGPT is not a good causal reasoner, but a good causal interpreter. Besides, ChatGPT has a serious hallucination on causal reasoning, possibly due to the reporting biases between causal and non-causal relationships in natural language, as well as ChatGPT's upgrading processes, such as RLHF. The In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (COT) techniques can further exacerbate such causal hallucination. Additionally, the causal reasoning ability of ChatGPT is sensitive to the words used to express the causal concept in prompts, and close-ended prompts perform better than open-ended prompts. For events in sentences, ChatGPT excels at capturing explicit causality rather than implicit causality, and performs better in sentences with lower event density and smaller lexical distance between events.",

      "abstract": "Emotion Support Conversation (ESC) is an emerging and challenging task with the goal of reducing the emotional distress of people. Previous attempts fail to maintain smooth transitions between utterances in ESC because they ignoring to grasp the fine-grained transition information at each dialogue turn. To solve this problem, we propose to take into account turn-level state Transitions of ESC (TransESC) from three perspectives, including semantics transition, strategy transition and emotion transition, to drive the conversation in a smooth and natural way. Specifically, we construct the state transition graph with a two-step way, named transit-then-interact, to grasp such three types of turn-level transition information. Finally, they are injected into the transition aware decoder to generate more engaging responses. Both automatic and human evaluations on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of TransESC to generate more smooth and effective supportive responses. Our source code will be publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Scientific literature review generation aims to extract and organize important information from an abundant collection of reference papers and produces corresponding reviews while lacking a clear and logical hierarchy. We observe that a high-quality catalogue-guided generation process can effectively alleviate this problem. Therefore, we present an atomic and challenging task named Hierarchical Catalogue Generation for Literature Review as the first step for review generation, which aims to produce a hierarchical catalogue of a review paper given various references. We construct a novel English Hierarchical Catalogues of Literature Reviews Dataset with 7.6k literature review catalogues and 389k reference papers. To accurately assess the model performance, we design two evaluation metrics for informativeness and similarity to ground truth from semantics and structure. Our extensive analyses verify the high quality of our dataset and the effectiveness of our evaluation metrics. We further benchmark diverse experiments on state-of-the-art summarization models like BART and large language models like ChatGPT to evaluate their capabilities. We further discuss potential directions for this task to motivate future research.",

      "abstract": "As a critical step to achieve human-like chatbots, empathetic response generation has attained increasing interests. Previous attempts are incomplete and not sufficient enough to elicit empathy because they only stay on the initial stage of empathy to automatically sense and simulate the feelings and thoughts of others via other-awareness. However, they ignore to include self-awareness to consider the own views of the self in their responses, which is a crucial process to achieve the empathy. To this end, we propose to generate Empathetic response with explicit Self-Other Awareness (EmpSOA). Specifically, three stages, self-other differentiation, self-other modulation and self-other generation, are devised to clearly maintain, regulate and inject the self-other aware information into the process of empathetic response generation. Both automatic and human evaluations on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of EmpSOA to generate more empathetic responses. Our source code will be publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography-to-Text generation (EEG-to-Text), which aims to directly generate natural text from EEG signals has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to the enormous potential for Brain-computer interfaces. However, the remarkable discrepancy between the subject-dependent EEG representation and the semantic-dependent text representation poses a great challenge to this task. To mitigate this, we devise a Curriculum Semantic-aware Contrastive Learning strategy (C- SCL), which effectively recalibrates the subject-dependent EEG representation to the semantic-dependent EEG representation, thereby reducing the discrepancy. Specifically, our C- SCL pulls semantically similar EEG representations together while pushing apart dissimilar ones. Besides, in order to introduce more meaningful contrastive pairs, we carefully employ curriculum learning to not only craft meaningful contrastive pairs but also make the learning progressively. We conduct extensive experiments on the ZuCo benchmark and our method combined with diverse models and architectures shows stable improvements across three types of metrics while achieving the new state-of-the-art. Further investigation proves not only its superiority in both the single-subject and low-resource settings but also its robust generalizability in the zero-shot setting.

      "abstract": "Thanks in part to the availability of copious annotated resources for some entity categories, existing studies have achieved superior performance in multimodal named entity recognition (MNER). However, in the real-world scenario, it is infeasible to enumerate all entity categories in advance. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate a new few-shot multimodal named entity recognition (FewMNER) task, which aims to effectively locate and identify named entities for a text-image pair only using a small number of labeled examples. Further, we explore the merit of in-context learning (ICL) and propose a novel framework to deal with FewMNER, where three points are taken into account: i.e., converting visual modality, selecting useful examples, and designing an effective task demonstration. Specifically, we first employ an image caption model to convert images into textual descriptions, enabling large language models to absorb information from visual modality. Then, we use the ranking of the sum of similarity rankings from both text and image modalities to select k-nearest examples, which form a demonstration context. Finally, we utilize the MNER definition and the meaning of each entity category as effective instruction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms baselines under several few-shot settings.",

      "abstract": "Adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can compromise the effectiveness of concurrent drug administration, posing a significant challenge in healthcare. As the development of new drugs continues, the potential for unknown adverse effects resulting from DDIs becomes a growing concern. Traditional computational methods for DDI prediction may fail to capture interactions for new drugs due to the lack of knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a new problem setup as zero-shot DDI prediction that deals with the case of new drugs. Leveraging textual information from online databases like DrugBank and PubChem, we propose an innovative approach TextDDI with a language model-based DDI predictor and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based information selector, enabling the selection of concise and pertinent text for accurate DDI prediction on new drugs. Empirical results show the benefits of the proposed approach on several settings including zero-shot and few-shot DDI prediction, and the selected texts are semantically relevant.

However, exploring this knowledge in Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is currently a blank slate due to the lack of annotated data and the high cost involved in obtaining such knowledge. Fortunately, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds promise in filling this void. Therefore, we propose a Multiple Knowledge Fusion Model (MKFM) to effectively integrate such knowledge generated by LLMs for ERC and empirically study its impact on the model. Experimental results on three public datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of multiple knowledge for ERC. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the contribution and complementarity of this knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to recognize fine-grained opinions and sentiments of users, which is an important problem in sentiment analysis. Recent work has shown that Sentiment-enhanced Pre-Training (SPT) can substantially improve the performance of various ABSA tasks. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive evaluation and fair comparison of existing SPT approaches. Therefore, this paper performs an empirical study to investigate the effectiveness of different SPT approaches. First, we develop an effective knowledge-mining method and leverage it to build a large-scale knowledge-annotated SPT corpus. Second, we systematically analyze the impact of integrating sentiment knowledge and other linguistic knowledge in pre-training. For each type of sentiment knowledge, we also examine and compare multiple integration methods. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of ABSA tasks to see how much SPT can facilitate the understanding of aspect-level sentiments.",

We focus on three tracks: Track 1 (Empathy and Emotion Prediction in Conversations, CONV), Track 2 (Empathy Prediction, EMP) and Track 3 (Emotion Classification, EMO), and designed three different models to address them separately. For Track 1, we designed a direct fine-tuning DeBERTa model for three regression tasks at the utterance-level. For Track 2, we designed a multi-task learning RoBERTa model for two regression tasks at the essay-level. For Track 3, we designed a RoBERTa model with data augmentation for the classification task at the essay-level. Finally, our team ranked 1st in the Track 1 (CONV), 5th in the Track 2 (EMP) and 3rd in the Track 3 (EMO) in the evaluation phase.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive distortions refer to patterns of irrational thinking that can lead to distorted perceptions of reality and mental health problems in individuals. Despite previous attempts to detect cognitive distortion through language, progress has been slow due to the lack of appropriate data. In this paper, we present the C2D2 dataset, the first expert-supervised Chinese Cognitive Distortion Dataset, which contains 7,500 cognitive distortion thoughts in everyday life scenes. Additionally, we examine the presence of cognitive distortions in social media texts shared by individuals diagnosed with mental disorders, providing insights into the association between cognitive distortions and mental health conditions. We propose that incorporating information about users’ cognitive distortions can enhance the performance of existing models mental disorder detection. We contribute to a better understanding of how cognitive distortions appear in individuals’ language and their impact on mental health.",

      "abstract": "Although achieving promising performance, current Natural Language Understanding models tend to utilize dataset biases instead of learning the intended task, which always leads to performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Toincrease the performance stability, previous debiasing methods empirically capture bias features from data to prevent the model from corresponding biases. However, our analyses show that the empirical debiasing methods may fail to capture part of the potential dataset biases and mistake semantic information of input text as biases, which limits the effectiveness of debiasing. To address these issues, we propose a debiasing framework IEGDB that comprehensively detects the dataset biases to induce a set of biased features, and then purifies the biased features with the guidance of information entropy. Experimental results show that IEGDB can consistently improve the stability of performance on OOD datasets for a set of widely adopted NLU models.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised neural machine translation has recently made remarkable strides, achieving impressive results with the exclusive use of monolingual corpora. Nonetheless, these methods still exhibit fundamental flaws, such as confusing similar words. A straightforward remedy to rectify this drawback is to employ bilingual dictionaries, however, high-quality bilingual dictionaries can be costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that incorporates images at the word level to augment the lexical mappings. Specifically, our method inserts visual representations into the model, modifying the corresponding embedding layer information. Besides, a visible matrix is adopted to isolate the impact of images on other unrelated words. Experiments on the Multi30k dataset with over 300,000 self-collected images validate the effectiveness in generating more accurate word translation, achieving an improvement of up to +2.81 BLEU score, which is comparable or even superior to using bilingual dictionaries.",

      "abstract": "Stance detection models may tend to rely on dataset bias in the text part as a shortcut and thus fail to sufficiently learn the interaction between the targets and texts. Recent debiasing methods usually treated features learned by small models or big models at earlier steps as bias features and proposed to exclude the branch learning those bias features during inference. However, most of these methods fail to disentangle the ``good'' stance features and ``bad'' bias features in the text part. In this paper, we investigate how to mitigate dataset bias in stance detection. Motivated by causal effects, we leverage a novel counterfactual inference framework, which enables us to capture the dataset bias in the text part as the direct causal effect of the text on stances and reduce the dataset bias in the text part by subtracting the direct text effect from the total causal effect. We novelly model bias features as features that correlate with the stance labels but fail on intermediate stance reasoning subtasks and propose an adversarial bias learning module to model the bias more accurately. To verify whether our model could better model the interaction between texts and targets, we test our model on recently proposed test sets to evaluate the understanding of the task from various aspects. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method (1) could better model the bias features, and (2) outperforms existing debiasing baselines on both the original dataset and most of the newly constructed test sets.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents BigCilin, the first Chinese open-domain knowledge graph with fine-grained hypernym-hyponym re-lations which are extracted automatically from multiple sources for Chinese named entities. With the fine-grained hypernym-hyponym relations, BigCilin owns flexible semantic hierarchical structure. Since the hypernym-hyponym paths are automati-cally generated and one entity may have several senses, we provide a path disambi-guation solution to map a hypernym-hyponym path of one entity to its one sense on the condition that the path and the sense express the same meaning. In order to conveniently access our BigCilin Knowle-dge graph, we provide web interface in two ways. One is that it supports querying any Chinese named entity and browsing the extracted hypernym-hyponym paths surro-unding the query entity. The other is that it gives a top-down browsing view to illust-rate the overall hierarchical structure of our BigCilin knowledge graph over some sam-pled entities.",

      "abstract": "Online encyclopedias, such as Wikipedia, have been well-developed and researched in the last two decades. One can find any attributes or other information of a wiki item on a wiki page edited by a community of volunteers. However, the traditional text, images and tables can hardly express some aspects of an wiki item. For example, when we talk about ``Shiba Inu'', one may care more about ``How to feed it'' or ``How to train it not to protect its food''. Currently, short-video platforms have become a hallmark in the online world. Whether you're on TikTok, Instagram, Kuaishou, or YouTube Shorts, short-video apps have changed how we consume and create content today. Except for producing short videos for entertainment, we can find more and more authors sharing insightful knowledge widely across all walks of life. These short videos, which we call knowledge videos, can easily express any aspects (e.g. hair or how-to-feed) consumers want to know about an item (e.g. Shiba Inu), and they can be systematically analyzed and organized like an online encyclopedia. In this paper, we propose Kuaipedia, a large-scale multi-modal encyclopedia consisting of items, aspects, and short videos lined to them, which was extracted from billions of videos of Kuaishou (Kwai), a well-known short-video platform in China. We first collected items from multiple sources and mined user-centered aspects from millions of users' queries to build an item-aspect tree. Then we propose a new task called ``multi-modal item-aspect linking'' as an expansion of ``entity linking'' to link short videos into item-aspect pairs and build the whole short-video encyclopedia. Intrinsic evaluations show that our encyclopedia is of large scale and highly accurate. We also conduct sufficient extrinsic experiments to show how Kuaipedia can help fundamental applications such as entity typing and entity linking.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Motivation With the rapid development of precision medicine, a large amount of health data (such as electronic health records, gene sequencing, medical images, etc.) has been produced. It encourages more and more interest in data-driven insight discovery from these data. A reasonable way to verify the derived insights is by checking evidence from biomedical literature. However, manual verification is inefficient and not scalable. Therefore, an intelligent technique is necessary to solve this problem. Results This article introduces a framework for biomedical evidence engineering, addressing this problem more effectively. The framework consists of a biomedical literature retrieval module and an evidence extraction module. The retrieval module ensembles several methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in biomedical literature retrieval. A BERT-based evidence extraction model is proposed to extract evidence from literature in response to queries. Moreover, we create a dataset with 1 million examples of biomedical evidence, 10 000 of which are manually annotated. Availability and implementation Datasets are available at https://github.com/SendongZhao.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotion states from multi-modal inputs. Existing end-to-end models typically fuse the uni-modal representations in the last layers without leveraging the multi-modal interactions among the intermediate representations. In this paper, we propose the multi-modal Recurrent Intermediate-Layer Aggregation (RILA) model to explore the effectiveness of leveraging the multi-modal interactions among the intermediate representations of deep pre-trained transformers for end-to-end emotion recognition. At the heart of our model is the Intermediate-Representation Fusion Module (IRFM), which consists of the multi-modal aggregation gating module and multi-modal token attention module. Specifically, at each layer, we first use the multi-modal aggregation gating module to capture the utterance-level interactions across the modalities and layers. Then we utilize the multi-modal token attention module to leverage the token-level multi-modal interactions. The experimental results on IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance, benefiting from fully exploiting the multi-modal interactions among the intermediate representations.",

      "abstract": "Recent works on multi-modal emotion recognition move towards end-to-end models, which can extract the task-specific features supervised by the target task compared with the two-phase pipeline. However, previous methods only model the feature interactions between the textual and either acoustic and visual modalities, ignoring capturing the feature interactions between the acoustic and visual modalities. In this paper, we propose the multi-modal end-to-end transformer (ME2ET), which can effectively model the tri-modal features interaction among the textual, acoustic, and visual modalities at the low-level and high-level. At the low-level, we propose the progressive tri-modal attention, which can model the tri-modal feature interactions by adopting a two-pass strategy and can further leverage such interactions to significantly reduce the computation and memory complexity through reducing the input token length. At the high-level, we introduce the tri-modal feature fusion layer to explicitly aggregate the semantic representations of three modalities. The experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets show that ME2ET achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The further in-depth analysis demonstrates the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of the proposed progressive tri-modal attention, which can help our model to achieve better performance while significantly reducing the computation and memory cost. Our code will be publicly available.",

However, tuning with prompt in biomedical domain has not been investigated thoroughly. Biomedical words are often rare in general domain, but quite ubiquitous in biomedical contexts, which dramatically deteriorates the performance of pre-trained models on downstream biomedical applications even after fine-tuning, especially in low-resource scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective approach to helping models learn rare biomedical words during tuning with prompt. Experimental results show that our method can achieve up to 6% improvement in biomedical natural language inference task without any extra parameters or training steps using few-shot vanilla prompt settings.",

      "abstract": "As aspect-level sentiment labels are expensive and labor-intensive to acquire, zero-shot aspect-level sentiment classification is proposed to learn classifiers applicable to new domains without using any annotated aspect-level data. In contrast, document-level sentiment data with ratings are more easily accessible. In this work, we achieve zero-shot aspect-level sentiment classification by only using document-level reviews. Our key intuition is that the sentiment representation of a document is composed of the sentiment representations of all the aspects of that document. Based on this, we propose the AF-DSC method to explicitly model such sentiment composition in reviews. AF-DSC first learns sentiment representations for all potential aspects and then aggregates aspect-level sentiments into a document-level one to perform document-level sentiment classification. In this way, we obtain the aspect-level sentiment classifier as the by-product of the document-level sentiment classifier. Experimental results on aspect-level sentiment classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit utilization of sentiment composition in document-level sentiment classification. Our model with only 30k training data outperforms previous work utilizing millions of data.",

      "abstract": "Given a task, human learns from easy to hard, whereas the model learns randomly. Undeniably, difficulty insensitive learning leads to great success in NLP, but little attention has been paid to the effect of text difficulty in NLP. In this research, we propose the Human Learning Matching Index (HLM Index) to investigate the effect of text difficulty. Experiment results show: (1) LSTM has more human-like learning behavior than BERT. (2) UID-SuperLinear gives the best evaluation of text difficulty among four text difficulty criteria. (3) Among nine tasks, some tasks' performance is related to text difficulty, whereas some are not. (4) Model trained on easy data performs best in easy and medium data, whereas trains on a hard level only perform well on hard data. (5) Training the model from easy to hard leads to fast convergence.",

      "abstract": "Existing approaches for sarcasm detection are mainly based on supervised learning, in which the promising performance largely depends on a considerable amount of labeled data or extra information. In the real world scenario, however, the abundant labeled data or extra information requires high labor cost, not to mention that sufficient annotated data is unavailable in many low-resource conditions. To alleviate this dilemma, we investigate sarcasm detection from an unsupervised perspective, in which we explore a masking and generation paradigm in the context to extract the context incongruities for learning sarcastic expression. Further, to improve the feature representations of the sentences, we use unsupervised contrastive learning to improve the sentence representation based on the standard dropout. Experimental results on six perceived sarcasm detection benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms baselines. Simultaneously, our unsupervised method obtains comparative performance with supervised methods for the intended sarcasm dataset.",

      "abstract": "Dialogue summarization aims to condense the original dialogue into a shorter version covering salient information, which is a crucial way to reduce dialogue data overload. Recently, the promising achievements in both dialogue systems and natural language generation techniques drastically lead this task to a new landscape, which results in significant research attentions. However, there still remains a lack of a comprehensive survey for this task. To this end, we take the first step and present a thorough review of this research field carefully and widely. In detail, we systematically organize the current works according to the characteristics of each domain, covering meeting, chat, email thread, customer service and medical dialogue. Additionally, we provide an overview of publicly available research datasets as well as organize two leaderboards under unified metrics. Furthermore, we discuss some future directions, including faithfulness, multi-modal, multi-domain and multi-lingual dialogue summarization, and give our thoughts respectively. We hope that this first survey of dialogue summarization can provide the community with a quick access and a general picture to this task and motivate future researches.",

Beyond the labeled instances, conceptual explanations of the causality can provide deep understanding of the causal facts to facilitate the causal reasoning process. However, such explanation information still remains absent in existing causal reasoning resources. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a human-annotated explainable CAusal REasoning dataset (e-CARE), which contains over 21K causal reasoning questions, together with natural language formed explanations of the causal questions. Experimental results show that generating valid explanations for causal facts still remains especially challenging for the state-of-the-art models, and the explanation information can be helpful for promoting the accuracy and stability of causal reasoning models.",

      "abstract": "Owing to the availability of various large-scale Machine Reading Comprehension ( MRC ) datasets, building an effective model to extract passage spans for question answering has been well studied in previous works. However, in reality, there are some questions that cannot be answered through the passage information, which brings more challenges to this task. In this article, we propose an Interactive Gated Decoder ( IG Decoder ), which focuses on modeling the interactions between the answer span prediction and no-answer prediction with a gating mechanism. We also propose a simple but effective approach for automatically generating pseudo training data, which aims to enrich the training data of the unanswerable questions. Experimental results on popular benchmark SQuAD 2.0 and NewsQA show that the proposed approaches yield consistent improvements over traditional BERT-large and strong ALBERT-xxlarge baseline systems. We also provide detailed ablations of the proposed method and error analysis on hard samples, which could be helpful in future research.",

      "abstract": "Multi-aspect controllable text generation is a more challenging and practical task than single-aspect control. Existing methods achieve complex multi-aspect control by fusing multiple controllers learned from single-aspect, but suffer from attribute degeneration caused by the mutual interference of these controllers. To address this, we provide observations on attribute fusion from a distributional perspective and propose to directly search for the intersection areas of multiple attribute distributions as their combination for generation. Our method first estimates the attribute space with an autoencoder structure. Afterward, we iteratively approach the intersections by jointly minimizing distances to points representing different attributes. Finally, we map them to attribute-relevant sentences with a prefix-tuning-based decoder. Experiments on the three-aspect control task, including sentiment, topic, and detoxification aspects, reveal that our method outperforms several strong baselines on attribute relevance and text quality and achieves the SOTA. Further analysis also supplies some explanatory support for the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Predicting the subsequent event for an existing event context is an important but challenging task, as it requires understanding the underlying relationship between events. Previous methods propose to retrieve relational features from event graph to enhance the modeling of event correlation. However, the sparsity of event graph may restrict the acquisition of relevant graph information, and hence influence the model performance. To address this issue, we consider automatically building of event graph using a BERT model. To this end, we incorporate an additional structured variable into BERT to learn to predict the event connections in the training process.Hence, in the test process, the connection relationship for unseen events can be predicted by the structured variable.Results on two event prediction tasks: script event prediction and story ending prediction, show that our approach can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

This leads to the trained MNMT model over-fitting low-resource language translations while under-fitting high-resource ones. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy named LSSD (LanguageSpecific Self-Distillation), which can alleviate the convergence inconsistency and help MNMT models achieve the best performance on each language pair simultaneously. Specifically, LSSD picks up language-specific best checkpoints for each language pair to teach the current model on the fly. Furthermore, we systematically explore three sample-level manipulations of knowledge transferring. Experimental results on three datasets show that LSSD obtains consistent improvements towards all language pairs and achieves the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention and lots of models have been proposed. However, the performance of the state-of-the-art models decreases sharply when they are deployed in the real world. We find that the main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text outputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with errors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of the ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key sentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words, which makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of multimodal sentiment analysis models directly. To address this problem, we propose the sentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically refine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues. Specifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to obtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then utilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine the sentiment word embeddings. The refined embeddings are taken as the textual inputs of the multimodal feature fusion module to predict the sentiment labels. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets including MOSI-Speechbrain, MOSI-IBM, and MOSI-iFlytek and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which surpasses the current state-of-the-art models on three datasets. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted for other multimodal feature fusion models easily.",

      "abstract": "On vision-language understanding (VLU) tasks, fusion-encoder vision-language models achieve superior results but sacrifice efficiency because of the simultaneous encoding of images and text. On the contrary, the dual encoder model that separately encodes images and text has the advantage in efficiency, while failing on VLU tasks due to the lack of deep cross-modal interactions. To get the best of both worlds, we propose DiDE, a framework that distills the knowledge of the fusion-encoder teacher model into the dual-encoder student model. Since the cross-modal interaction is the key to the superior performance of teacher model but is absent in the student model, we encourage the student not only to mimic the predictions of teacher, but also to calculate the cross-modal attention distributions and align with the teacher. Experimental results demonstrate that DiDE is competitive with the fusion-encoder teacher model in performance (only a 1% drop) while enjoying 4 times faster inference. Further analyses reveal that the proposed cross-modal attention distillation is crucial to the success of our framework.",

Meanwhile, the manual construction of a query-focused summarization corpus is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we use Wikipedia to automatically collect a large query-focused summarization dataset (named W <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">iki</small> R <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ef</small> ) of more than 280,000 examples, which can serve as a means of data augmentation. We also develop a BERT-based query-focused summarization model (Q-BERT) to extract sentences from the documents as summaries. To better adapt a huge model containing millions of parameters to tiny benchmarks, we identify and fine-tune only a sparse subnetwork, which corresponds to a small fraction of the whole model parameters. Experimental results on three DUC benchmarks show that the model pre-trained on W <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">iki</small> R <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ef</small> has already achieved reasonable performance. After fine-tuning on the specific benchmark datasets, the model with data augmentation outperforms strong comparison systems. Moreover, both our proposed Q-BERT model and subnetwork fine-tuning further improve the model performance.",

Despite the recent success in textual aspect-based sentiment analysis, existing models mainly focused on utilizing the object-level semantic information in the image but ignore explicitly using the visual emotional cues, especially the facial emotions. How to distill visual emotional cues and align them with the textual content remains a key challenge to solve the problem. In this work, we introduce a face-sensitive image-to-emotional-text translation (FITE) method, which focuses on capturing visual sentiment cues through facial expressions and selectively matching and fusing with the target aspect in textual modality. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first that explicitly utilize the emotional information from images in the multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis task. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017 datasets. The improvement demonstrates the superiority of our model in capturing aspect-level sentiment in multimodal data with facial expressions.",

      "abstract": "Dialogue summarization helps users capture salient information from various types of dialogues has received much attention recently. However, current works mainly focus on English dialogue summarization, leaving other languages less well explored. Therefore, we present a multi-lingual dialogue summarization dataset, namely MSAMSum, which covers dialogue-summary pairs in six languages. Specifically, we derive MSAMSum from the standard SAMSum using sophisticated translation techniques and further employ two methods to ensure the integral translation quality and summary factual consistency. Given the proposed MSAMum, we systematically set up five multi-lingual settings for this task, including a novel mix-lingual dialogue summarization setting. To illustrate the utility of our dataset, we benchmark various experiments with pre-trained models under different settings and report results in both supervised and zero-shot manners. We also discuss some future works towards this task to motivate future researches.",

      "abstract": "Weighted decoding methods composed of the pretrained language model (LM) and the controller have achieved promising results for controllable text generation. However, these models often suffer from a control strength/fluency trade-off problem as higher control strength is more likely to generate incoherent and repetitive text. In this paper, we illustrate this trade-off is arisen by the controller imposing the target attribute on the LM at improper positions. And we propose a novel framework based on existing weighted decoding methods called CAT-PAW, which introduces a lightweight regulator to adjust bias signals from the controller at different decoding positions. Experiments on positive sentiment control, topic control, and language detoxification show the effectiveness of our CAT-PAW upon 4 SOTA models.",

      "abstract": "Argument mining (AM) is a challenging task as it requires recognizing the complex argumentation structures involving multiple subtasks.To handle all subtasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion, previous works generally transform AM into a dependency parsing task.However, such methods largely require complex pre- and post-processing to realize the task transformation.In this paper, we investigate the end-to-end AM task from a novel perspective by proposing a generative framework, in which the expected outputs of AM are framed as a simple target sequence. Then, we employ a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence language model with a constrained pointer mechanism (CPM) to model the clues for all the subtasks of AM in the light of the target sequence. Furthermore, we devise a reconstructed positional encoding (RPE) to alleviate the order biases induced by the autoregressive generation paradigm.Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two AM benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Causal chain reasoning (CCR) is an essential ability for many decision-making AI systems, which requires the model to build reliable causal chains by connecting causal pairs. However, CCR suffers from two main transitive problems: threshold effect and scene drift. In other words, the causal pairs to be spliced may have a conflicting threshold boundary or scenario.To address these issues, we propose a novel Reliable Causal chain reasoning framework (ReCo), which introduces exogenous variables to represent the threshold and scene factors of each causal pair within the causal chain, and estimates the threshold and scene contradictions across exogenous variables via structural causal recurrent neural networks (SRNN). Experiments show that ReCo outperforms a series of strong baselines on both Chinese and English CCR datasets. Moreover, by injecting reliable causal chain knowledge distilled by ReCo, BERT can achieve better performances on four downstream causal-related tasks than BERT models enhanced by other kinds of knowledge.",

Compared with multiple-choice QA, it is challenging because the answers to a question are not unique and they are supposed to be popular and diverse. Our strategy exploits the dataset itself and negative samples that we collect from WordNet to train a ranker that picks out the most popular answers for commonsense questions. The effectiveness of our strategy is verified on different pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) in a pipeline framework, where an MLM reranks the generated answers. Further, we explore an end-to-end framework where MLMs are utilized to guide the generation of generative language models (GLMs). Taking advantage of reinforcement learning, we apply policy gradient to train a GLM with the rewards fed back by an MLM. Empirical results on ProtoQA dataset demonstrate that MLMs can acquire the ability to distinguish the popular answers and improve the typical answer generation of GLMs as well.",

We processed and analyzed the electroencephalogram (EEG) before and after vision-induced motion sickness, and obtained the EEG power spectrum characteristics. The results showed that the power spectrum characteristics of C3 channel α, Θ and δ waves were significantly different before and after stimulation (p<0.05). This study indicated that EEG power spectrum could be used as a reference for quantitative detection and evaluation of vision-induced motion sickness. It provides a reference for the detection and evaluation of motion sickness, and has a certain reference value for the study of the inherent neural mechanism of motion sickness.",

      "abstract": "Providing timely accessibility reminders of a point-of-interest (POI) plays a\\nvital role in improving user satisfaction of finding places and making visiting\\ndecisions. However, it is difficult to keep the POI database in sync with the\\nreal-world counterparts due to the dynamic nature of business changes. To\\nalleviate this problem, we formulate and present a practical solution that\\njointly extracts POI mentions and identifies their coupled accessibility labels\\nfrom unstructured text. We approach this task as a sequence tagging problem,\\nwhere the goal is to produce &lt;POI name, accessibility label&gt; pairs from\\nunstructured text. This task is challenging because of two main issues: (1) POI\\nnames are often newly-coined words so as to successfully register new entities\\nor brands and (2) there may exist multiple pairs in the text, which\\nnecessitates dealing with one-to-many or many-to-one mapping to make each POI\\ncoupled with its accessibility label. To this end, we propose a\\nGeographic-Enhanced and Dependency-guIded sequence Tagging (GEDIT) model to\\nconcurrently address the two challenges. First, to alleviate challenge #1, we\\ndevelop a geographic-enhanced pre-trained model to learn the text\\nrepresentations. Second, to mitigate challenge #2, we apply a relational graph\\nconvolutional network to learn the tree node representations from the parsed\\ndependency tree. Finally, we construct a neural sequence tagging model by\\nintegrating and feeding the previously pre-learned representations into a CRF\\nlayer. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the\\nsuperiority and effectiveness of GEDIT. In addition, it has already been\\ndeployed in production at Baidu Maps. Statistics show that the proposed\\nsolution can save significant human effort and labor costs to deal with the\\nsame amount of documents, which confirms that it is a practical way for POI\\naccessibility maintenance.\\n",

      "abstract": "Objective: The main goal of this study is to clarify the electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics of the stress response caused by vestibular endurance training under real conditions. Methods: Ten pilot trainees received a series of acute anti-vertigo training stimulations on the rotary ladder while recording electroencephalographic data (64 electrodes). Afterward, the anti-vertigo ability of the subject was tested for the best performance after 1 month of training and verified whether it is related to the EEG signals we collected before. Results: (1) The absolute power of α waves in the C3 and C4 regions is the same as the difference between 1 min before and 2 min after stimulation, and their activity is enhanced by stimulation. Otherwise, the activation of the C3 region after 5 min of stimulation is still significantly changed. (2) Through Spearman's correlation analysis, we found that the α waves in the C3 and C4 the greater the power change, the better the performance of the subject in the proficient stage. Conclusion: C3 and C4 areas are specific brain regions of the stress response of anti-vertigo endurance training, and the absolute power of the α wave can be used as a parameter for identifying the degree of motion sickness (MS). The absolute power changes of α waves in the C3 and C4 areas are positively correlated with their anti-vertigo potential. Significance: Increasing the absolute power of α wave in the C3 and C4 is a manifestation of MS stress adaptability.",

      "abstract": "Meeting summarization is a challenging task due to its dynamic interaction nature among multiple speakers and lack of sufficient training data. Existing methods view the meeting as a linear sequence of utterances while ignoring the diverse relations between each utterance. Besides, the limited labeled data further hinders the ability of data-hungry neural models. In this paper, we try to mitigate the above challenges by introducing dialogue-discourse relations. First, we present a Dialogue Discourse-Dware Meeting Summarizer (DDAMS) to explicitly model the interaction between utterances in a meeting by modeling different discourse relations. The core module is a relational graph encoder, where the utterances and discourse relations are modeled in a graph interaction manner. Moreover, we devise a Dialogue Discourse-Aware Data Augmentation (DDADA) strategy to construct a pseudo-summarization corpus from existing input meetings, which is 20 times larger than the original dataset and can be used to pretrain DDAMS. Experimental results on AMI and ICSI meeting datasets show that our full system can achieve SOTA performance. Our codes and outputs are available at https://github.com/xcfcode/DDAMS/.",

      "abstract": "Recent work has shown success in incorporating pre-trained models like BERT to improve NLP systems. However, existing pre-trained models lack of causal knowledge which prevents today's NLP systems from thinking like humans. In this paper, we investigate the problem of injecting causal knowledge into pre-trained models. There are two fundamental problems: 1) how to collect various granularities of causal pairs from unstructured texts; 2) how to effectively inject causal knowledge into pre-trained models. To address these issues, we extend the idea of CausalBERT from previous studies, and conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. In addition, we adopt a regularization-based method to preserve the already learned knowledge with an extra regularization term while injecting causal knowledge. Extensive experiments on 7 datasets, including four causal pair classification tasks, two causal QA tasks and a causal inference task, demonstrate that CausalBERT captures rich causal knowledge and outperforms all pre-trained models-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving a new causal inference benchmark.",

To fully exploit such discourse structure in multiparty dialogue, we present a discourse-aware dialogue graph neural network, DADgraph, which explicitly constructs the dialogue graph using discourse dependency links and discourse relations. To validate our model, we perform experiments on the Molweni corpus, a large-scale MRC dataset built over multiparty dialogue annotated with discourse structure. Experiments on Molweni show that our discourse-aware model achieves statistically significant improvements compared against strong neural network MRC baselines.",

      "abstract": "Recently, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered by Seq2Seq framework have been proposed to achieve the goal of generating more abstractive summaries by learning to map input text to output text. At a high level, such neural models can freely generate summaries without any constraint on the words or phrases used. Moreover, their format is closer to human-edited summaries and output is more readable and fluent. However, the neural model's abstraction ability is a double-edged sword. A commonly observed problem with the generated summaries is the distortion or fabrication of factual information in the article. This inconsistency between the original text and the summary has caused various concerns over its applicability, and the previous evaluation methods of text summarization are not suitable for this issue. In response to the above problems, the current research direction is predominantly divided into two categories, one is to design fact-aware evaluation metrics to select outputs without factual inconsistency errors, and the other is to develop new summarization systems towards factual consistency. In this survey, we focus on presenting a comprehensive review of these fact-specific evaluation methods and text summarization models.",

      "abstract": "Sarcasm is a sophisticated linguistic phenomenon and commonly manifests on social media platforms, which poses a great challenge for opinion mining systems. Therefore, multimodal sarcasm detection, which aims to understand the implied sentiment in the video, has gained more and more attention. However, previous works mostly focus on multimodal feature fusion without explicitly modeling the incongruity between modalities, such as expressing verbal compliments while rolling eyes, which is an obvious cue for detecting sarcasm. In this article, we propose the incongruity-aware attention network (IWAN), which detects sarcasm by focusing on the word-level incongruity between modalities via a scoring mechanism. This scoring mechanism could assign larger weights to words with incongruent modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IWAN model, which not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MUStARD dataset but also offers the advantages of interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Non-autoregressive neural machine translation, which decomposes the dependence on previous target tokens from the inputs of the decoder, has achieved impressive inference speedup but at the cost of inferior accuracy. Previous works employ iterative decoding to improve the translation by applying multiple refinement iterations. However, a serious drawback is that these approaches expose the serious weakness in recognizing the erroneous translation pieces. In this paper, we propose an architecture named RewriteNAT to explicitly learn to rewrite the erroneous translation pieces. Specifically, RewriteNAT utilizes a locator module to locate the erroneous ones, which are then revised into the correct ones by a revisor module. Towards keeping the consistency of data distribution with iterative decoding, an iterative training strategy is employed to further improve the capacity of rewriting. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used benchmarks show that RewriteNAT can achieve better performance while significantly reducing decoding time, compared with previous iterative decoding strategies. In particular, RewriteNAT can obtain competitive results with autoregressive translation on WMT14 En-De, En-Fr and WMT16 Ro-En translation benchmarks.",

A QA system then determines if the supporting knowledge bases, regarded as potential premises, entail the hypotheses. In this paper, we investigate a neural-symbolic QA approach that integrates natural logic reasoning within deep learning architectures, towards developing effective and yet explainable question answering models. The proposed model gradually bridges a hypothesis and candidate premises following natural logic inference steps to build proof paths. Entailment scores between the acquired intermediate hypotheses and candidate premises are measured to determine if a premise entails the hypothesis. As the natural logic reasoning process forms a tree-like, hierarchical structure, we embed hypotheses and premises in a Hyperbolic space rather than Euclidean space to acquire more precise representations. Empirically, our method outperforms prior work on answering multiple-choice science questions, achieving the best results on two publicly available datasets. The natural logic inference process inherently provides evidence to help explain the prediction process.",

Previous works mainly utilize a single semantic unit of financial text, such as words, events, sentences, to predict the tendency of stock market. However, the interaction of different-grained information within financial text can be useful for context knowledge supplement and predictive information selection, and then improve the performance of stock market prediction. To facilitate this, we propose constructing a heterogeneous graph with different-grained information nodes from financial text for the task. A novel heterogeneous neural network is presented to aggregate multi-grained information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach reaches higher performance than baselines.",

      "abstract": "Obtaining affective response is a key step in building empathetic dialogue systems. This task has been studied a lot in generation-based chatbots, but the related research in retrieval-based chatbots is still in the early stage. Existing works in retrieval-based chatbots are based on Retrieve-and-Rerank framework, which have a common problem of satisfying affect label at the expense of response quality. To address this problem, we propose a simple and effective Retrieve-Discriminate-Rewrite framework. The framework replaces the reranking mechanism with a new discriminate-and-rewrite mechanism, which predicts the affect label of the retrieved high-quality response via discrimination module and further rewrites the affect unsatisfied response via rewriting module. This can not only guarantee the quality of the response, but also satisfy the given affect label. In addition, another challenge for this line of research is the lack of an off-the-shelf affective response dataset. To address this problem and test our proposed framework, we annotate a Sentimental Douban Conversation Corpus based on the original Douban Conversation Corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed framework is effective and outperforms competitive baselines.",

Then, we only fine-tune the lottery subnetwork, a small fraction of the whole parameters, on the annotated target domain data for adaptation. To obtain more adaptable subnetworks, we introduce self-attention attribution to weigh parameters, beyond simply pruning the smallest magnitude parameters, which can be seen as combining structured pruning and unstructured magnitude pruning softly. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the full model fine-tuning adaptation on four out of five domains when only a small amount of annotated data available for adaptation. Moreover, introducing self-attention attribution reserves more parameters for important attention heads in the lottery subnetwork and improves the target domain model performance. Our further analyses reveal that, besides exploiting fewer parameters, the choice of subnetworks is critical to the effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge plays an essential role in biomedical literature search (BLS) systems, filling the semantic gap between queries and documents. Knowledge bases, constructed by human experts or machine learning methods, are generally regarded as the main sources serving external knowledge. However, a good knowledge base must balances its particularity and generalization, resulting limited knowledge coverage and utilization to BLS systems. Considering massive documents in a BLS system, and recently developing Open IE techniques by which we can automatically extract structured knowledge from documents, how about harnessing distilled internal knowledge rather than external knowledge to conduct BLS systems? Internal knowledge, providing tailored particular knowledge to BLS systems, is supposed to lead better knowledge utilization and much more competitive performance on literature search. In this paper, we design an novel internal knowledge driven BLS system upon a Multi-layered Encoders incorporating Multi-layered internal Knowledge graph, called MEMK. MEMK harnesses distilled internal structural knowledge, empowering interactive representations learning of query and documents. The experiments show that MEMK outperforms strong baselines on a public benchmark, and internal knowledge based query expansion can further improve the performance to a new state of the art.",

Different from documents like news and scientific papers, a meeting is naturally full of dialogue-specific structural information. However, previous works model a meeting in a sequential manner, while ignoring the rich structural information. In this paper, we develop a Dialogue Discourse-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks (DDA-GCN) for meeting summarization by utilizing dialogue discourse, which is a dialogue-specific structure that can provide pre-defined semantic relationships between each utterance. We first transform the entire meeting text with dialogue discourse relations into a discourse graph and then use DDA-GCN to encode the semantic representation of the graph. Finally, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to generate the summary. In addition, we utilize the question-answer discourse relation to construct a pseudo-summarization corpus, which can be used to pre-train our model. Experimental results on the AMI dataset show that our model outperforms various baselines and can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Currently, there is a rapidly increasing need for high-quality biomedical knowledge graphs (BioKG) that provide direct and precise biomedical knowledge. In the context of COVID-19, this issue is even more necessary to be highlighted. However, most BioKG construction inevitably includes numerous conflicts and noises deriving from incorrect knowledge descriptions in literature and defective information extraction techniques. Many studies have demonstrated that reasoning upon the knowledge graph is effective in eliminating such conflicts and noises. This paper proposes a method BioGRER to improve the BioKG's quality, which comprehensively combines the knowledge graph embedding and logic rules that support and negate triplets in the BioKG. In the proposed model, the BioKG refinement problem is formulated as the probability estimation for triplets in the BioKG. We employ the variational EM algorithm to optimize knowledge graph embedding and logic rule inference alternately. In this way, our model could combine efforts from both the knowledge graph embedding and logic rules, leading to better results than using them alone. We evaluate our model over a COVID-19 knowledge graph and obtain competitive results.",

      "abstract": "Along with the explosion of web information, information flow service has attracted the attention of users. In this kind of service, how to measure the correlation between texts and further filter the redundant information collected from multiple sources becomes the key solution to meet the users desire. Recently, the popular text correlation calculation methods mostly represent text as vector and then measure text similarity as text correlation. However, in information flow service, most of the texts are news, and the core element in a news is the event it stated. Therefore, we need a way to extract the core features that are related to the event stated by text, so we can accurately calculate text correlation via these extracted features. Unfortunately, recent event-related researches focus on the sentence-level. To calculate text correlation, we need to grasp the content of the text from the passage-level, which indicates that passage-level event analysis has more impact. To this end, we propose a passage-level event representation method based on sentence-level event extraction. It constructs a passage-level event connection graph based on the extracting results obtained from sentences. After that, it selects the important nodes in the graph as the representations of the passage-level events. Based on the passage-level representations, we can acquire text correlation. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms conventional text correlation calculation methods.",

In this work, we integrate structural information (from which tuple, which sentence) and semantic information (semantic similarity) to do the canonicalization. We represent the two types of information as a multi-layered graph: the structural information forms the links across the sentence, relational phrase, and noun phrase layers; the semantic information forms weighted intra-layer links for each layer. We propose a graph neural network model to aggregate the representations of noun phrases and relational phrases through the multi-layered meta-graph structure. Experiments show that our model outperforms existing approaches on a public datasets in general domain.",

We present the Molweni dataset, a machine reading comprehension\\n(MRC) dataset with discourse structure built over multiparty dialog. Molweni's\\nsource samples from the Ubuntu Chat Corpus, including 10,000 dialogs comprising\\n88,303 utterances. We annotate 30,066 questions on this corpus, including both\\nanswerable and unanswerable questions. Molweni also uniquely contributes\\ndiscourse dependency annotations in a modified Segmented Discourse\\nRepresentation Theory (SDRT; Asher et al., 2016) style for all of its\\nmultiparty dialogs, contributing large-scale (78,245 annotated discourse\\nrelations) data to bear on the task of multiparty dialog discourse parsing. Our\\nexperiments show that Molweni is a challenging dataset for current MRC models:\\nBERT-wwm, a current, strong SQuAD 2.0 performer, achieves only 67.7% F1 on\\nMolweni's questions, a 20+% significant drop as compared against its SQuAD 2.0\\nperformance.\\n",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a new practical task, document-scale text content manipulation, which is the opposite of text style transfer and aims to preserve text styles while altering the content. In detail, the input is a set of structured records and a reference text for describing another recordset. The output is a summary that accurately describes the partial content in the source recordset with the same writing style of the reference. The task is unsupervised due to lack of parallel data, and is challenging to select suitable records and style words from bi-aspect inputs respectively and generate a high-fidelity long document. To tackle those problems, we first build a dataset based on a basketball game report corpus as our testbed, and present an unsupervised neural model with interactive attention mechanism, which is used for learning the semantic relationship between records and reference texts to achieve better content transfer and better style preservation. In addition, we also explore the effectiveness of the back-translation in our task for constructing some pseudo-training pairs. Empirical results show superiority of our approaches over competitive methods, and the models also yield a new state-of-the-art result on a sentence-level dataset. 1",

Our goal is to learn a neural semantic parser when only prior knowledge about a limited number of simple rules is available, without access to either annotated programs or execution results. Our approach is initialized by rules, and improved in a back-translation paradigm using generated question-program pairs from the semantic parser and the question generator. A phrase table with frequent mapping patterns is automatically derived, also updated as training progresses, to measure the quality of generated instances. We train the model with model-agnostic meta-learning to guarantee the accuracy and stability on examples covered by rules, and meanwhile acquire the versatility to generalize well on examples uncovered by rules. Results on three benchmark datasets with different domains and programs show that our approach incrementally improves the accuracy. On WikiSQL, our best model is comparable to the state-of-the-art system learned from denotations.",

      "abstract": "Conditions play an essential role in biomedical statements. However, existing biomedical knowledge graphs (BioKGs) only focus on factual knowledge, organized as a flat relational network of biomedical concepts. These BioKGs ignore the conditions of the facts being valid, which loses essential contexts for knowledge exploration and inference. We consider both facts and their conditions in biomedical statements and proposed a three-layered information-lossless representation of BioKG. The first layer has biomedical concept nodes, attribute nodes. The second layer represents both biomedical fact and condition tuples by nodes of the relation phrases, connecting to the subject and object in the first layer. The third layer has nodes of statements connecting to a set of fact tuples and/or condition tuples in the second layer. We transform the BioKG construction problem into a sequence labeling problem based on a novel designed tag schema. We design a Multi-Input Multi-Output sequence labeling model (MIMO) that learns from multiple input signals and generates proper number of multiple output sequences for tuple extraction. Experiments on a newly constructed dataset show that MIMO outperforms the existing methods. Further case study demonstrates that the BioKGs constructed provide a good understanding of the biomedical statements.",

      "abstract": "Tumor vaccine inducing effective and perdurable antitumor immunity has a great potential for cancer prevention and therapy. The key indicator for a successful tumor vaccine is to boost the immune system to produce more memory T cells. Although many tumor vaccines have been designed in the past two decades, few of them involve actively regulating immune memory CD8+T cells. The behavior of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) in stimulating the immune system is related to the formation of immune memory. At the same time, the metabolic pattern of memory CD8+T cells changed significantly compared to effector T cells. Here we present a tumor vaccine vector (TA-Met@MS) by encapsulating tumor antigen (TA, the whole tumor cell antigen induced with photothermal-therapy (PTT) as a TAA model), metformin (Met, an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)) and Hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS, with photothermal conversion effect in the near infrared (NIR) region) into poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres. TA via the treatment with PTT showed high immunogenicity and immune-adjuvant effectiveness. We found that NIR light-mediated photothermal effect lead to a pulsed-release behavior of TA and Met from the microspheres, based on their sustained release. The released TA regulated primary T cell expansion and contraction, and stimulated the production of effector T cells at the early immunization stage. The metabolic behavior of the cells was then intervened from glycolysis into fatty acids oxidation (FAO) through the activation of AMPK mediated by the released Met, which enhanced cell survival and facilitated the differentiation of memory CD8+T cells. Our study may present a valuable insight to design tumor vaccine for enhanced cancer prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Self-attention networks (SANs) with selective mechanism has produced substantial improvements in various NLP tasks by concentrating on a subset of input words. However, the underlying reasons for their strong performance have not been well explained. In this paper, we bridge the gap by assessing the strengths of selective SANs (SSANs), which are implemented with a flexible and universal Gumbel-Softmax. Experimental results on several representative NLP tasks, including natural language inference, semantic role labelling, and machine translation, show that SSANs consistently outperform the standard SANs. Through well-designed probing experiments, we empirically validate that the improvement of SSANs can be attributed in part to mitigating two commonly-cited weaknesses of SANs: word order encoding and structure modeling. Specifically, the selective mechanism improves SANs by paying more attention to content words that contribute to the meaning of the sentence.",

      "abstract": "Although neural table-to-text models have achieved remarkable progress with the help of large-scale datasets, they suffer insufficient learning problem with limited training data. Recently, pre-trained language models show potential in few-shot learning with linguistic knowledge learnt from pretraining on large-scale corpus. However, benefiting table-to-text generation in few-shot setting with the powerful pretrained language model faces three challenges, including (1) the gap between the task’s structured input and the natural language input for pretraining language model. (2) The lack of modeling for table structure and (3) improving text fidelity with less incorrect expressions that are contradicting to the table. To address aforementioned problems, we propose TableGPT for table-to-text generation. At first, we utilize table transformation module with template to rewrite structured table in natural language as input for GPT-2. In addition, we exploit multi-task learning with two auxiliary tasks that preserve table’s structural information by reconstructing the structure from GPT-2’s representation and improving the text’s fidelity with content matching task aligning the table and information in the generated text. By experimenting on Humans, Songs and Books, three few-shot table-to-text datasets in different domains, our model outperforms existing systems on most few-shot settings.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has received much attention recently in the natural language processing community. Considering that the emotions of the utterances in conversations are interactive, previous works usually implicitly model the emotion interaction between utterances by modeling dialogue context, but the misleading emotion information from context often interferes with the emotion interaction. We noticed that the gold emotion labels of the context utterances can provide explicit and accurate emotion interaction, but it is impossible to input gold labels at inference time. To address this problem, we propose an iterative emotion interaction network, which uses iteratively predicted emotion labels instead of gold emotion labels to explicitly model the emotion interaction. This approach solves the above problem, and can effectively retain the performance advantages of explicit modeling. We conduct experiments on two datasets, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Based on results from previous work, the performance bottleneck of current models lies in the stage of content planing (selecting and ordering salient content from the input). That is, performance drops drastically when an oracle content plan is replaced by a model-inferred one during surface realization. In this paper, we propose to enhance neural content planning by (1) understanding data values with contextual numerical value representations that bring the sense of value comparison into content planning; (2) verifying the importance and ordering of the selected sequence of records with policy gradient. We evaluated our model on ROTOWIRE and MLB, two datasets on this task, and results show that our model outperforms existing systems with respect to content planning metrics.",

Despite deep learning has achieved significant success in many fields, it still hardly drives today’s AI to strong AI, as it lacks of causation, which is a fundamental concept in human thinking and reasoning. In this task, we dedicate to detecting causation, especially counterfactuals from texts. We explore multiple pre-trained models to learn basic features and then fine-tune models with counterfactual data and pseudo-labeling data. Our team HIT-SCIR wins the first place (1st) in Sub-task 1 — Detecting Counterfactual Statements and is ranked 4th in Sub-task 2 — Detecting Antecedent and Consequence. In this paper we provide a detailed description of the approach, as well as the results obtained in this task.",

      "abstract": "Many problems in natural language processing (NLP) can be cast as the problem of segmenting a sequence. In this article, we combine the semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRF) with neural networks to solve NLP segmentation problems. We focus on the segment representation in neural semi-CRF which is important to the performance. Based on our preliminary work in Liu et al.[1], we represent a segment by both encoding the subsequence and embedding the segment string. We conduct a systematic study of the utility of various components in subsequence encoding and propose a method of constructing and deriving segment string embeddings. Extensive experiments on three typical segmentation problems, namely, shallow syntax parsing, named entity recognition, and Chinese word segmentation are conducted. The results show that we can achieve equally-performed subsequence encoding with a three times faster concatenation network compared to previous work. The results also show that the segment string embeddings help our neural semi-CRF model to achieve a macro-averaged error reduction of 13.15% over a strong baseline using deep contextualized embeddings and bidirectional long-short-term memory CRF, which also show the usefulness of semi-CRF even with contextualized embeddings. These results are competitive with the state-of-the-art segmentation systems.",

      "abstract": "Research into the area of multiparty dialog has grown considerably over recent years. We present the Molweni dataset, a machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset with discourse structure built over multiparty dialog. Molweni's source samples from the Ubuntu Chat Corpus, including 10,000 dialogs comprising 88,303 utterances. We annotate 30,066 questions on this corpus, including both answerable and unanswerable questions. Molweni also uniquely contributes discourse dependency annotations in a modified Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT; Asher et al., 2016) style for all of its multiparty dialogs, contributing large-scale (78,245 annotated discourse relations) data to bear on the task of multiparty dialog discourse parsing. Our experiments show that Molweni is a challenging dataset for current MRC models: BERT-wwm, a current, strong SQuAD 2.0 performer, achieves only 67.7% F1 on Molweni's questions, a 20+% significant drop as compared against its SQuAD 2.0 performance.",

For each multi-party dialogue, we annotate the discourse structure and question-answer pairs for dialogues. As we know, this is the first large scale corpus for multi-party dialogues discourse parsing, and we firstly propose the task for multi-party dialogues machine reading comprehension.",

Existing BLS systems adopt a \"C-A\" paradigm that is to design query-document similarity measurement based on words/phrases in the unstructured Content and to develop search Algorithms. In this work, we argue that structures should be extracted and utilized to bridge the gap between text content and knowledge-based search. And graph is one of the most effective structured forms of knowledge and more informative than words or phrases. So we carry out a paradigm shift from \"C-A\" to \"CTGA\". Here \"T\" is for factual tuple of concepts and relations, and \"G\" is for knowledge graph. Our proposed graph-based BLS system has three parts: (1) it uses neural information extraction models to turn text into tuples; (2) it represents the tuples of a query or a document as a knowledge graph of linked concept nodes; (3) it has an efficient graph-based matching algorithm to return related documents at the level of structured knowledge. Experiments show that in both objective and subjective evaluation, our CTGA performs significantly better than traditional CA-based PubMed.",

      "abstract": "Conditions play an essential role in scientific observations, hypotheses, and statements. Unfortunately, existing scientific knowledge graphs (SciKGs) represent factual knowledge as a flat relational network of concepts, as same as the KGs in general domain, without considering the conditions of the facts being valid, which loses important contexts for inference and exploration. In this work, we propose a novel representation of SciKG, which has three layers. The first layer has concept nodes, attribute nodes, as well as the attaching links from attribute to concept. The second layer represents both fact tuples and condition tuples. Each tuple is a node of the relation name, connecting to the subject and object that are concept or attribute nodes in the first layer. The third layer has nodes of statement sentences traceable to the original paper and authors. Each statement node connects to a set of fact tuples and/or condition tuples in the second layer. We design a semi-supervised Multi-Input Multi-Output sequence labeling model that learns complex dependencies between the sequence tags from multiple signals and generates output sequences for fact and condition tuples. It has a self-training module of multiple strategies to leverage the massive scientific data for better performance when manual annotation is limited. Experiments on a data set of 141M sentences show that our model outperforms existing methods and the SciKGs we constructed provide a good understanding of the scientific statements.",

      "abstract": "Detecting stance from certain types of question-answer pairs is an interesting problem which has not been carefully explored. Unlike previous stance detection tasks, targets here are not given entities or claims but entire questions, which makes it difficult to capture the semantics of targets and build target-dependent representations of answers. To address them, we introduce the Recurrent Conditional Attention (RCA) model which incorporates a conditional attention structure into the recurrent reading process. RCA iteratively guides the distillation of question semantic with answer information and collects stance-oriented text relating to question, further revealing mutual relationship among stance, answer and question. Experiments on a manually labeled Chinese community QA stance dataset show that RCA outperforms four strong baselines by average 2.90% on macro-F1 and 2.66% on micro-F1 respectively.",

      "abstract": "Deep contextualized word embeddings (Embeddings from Language Model, short for ELMo), as an emerging and effective replacement for the static word embeddings, have achieved success on a bunch of syntactic and semantic NLP problems. However, little is known about what is responsible for the improvements. In this article, we focus on the effect of ELMo for a typical syntax problem—universal POS tagging and dependency parsing. We incorporate ELMo as additional word embeddings into the state-of-the-art POS tagger and dependency parser, and it leads to consistent performance improvements. Experimental results show the model using ELMo outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by an average of 0.91 for POS tagging and 1.11 for dependency parsing. Further analysis reveals that the improvements mainly result from the ELMo’s better abstraction ability on the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, and the character-level word representation in ELMo contributes a lot to the abstraction. Based on ELMo’s advantage on OOV, experiments that simulate low-resource settings are conducted and the results show that deep contextualized word embeddings are effective for data-insufficient tasks where the OOV problem is severe.",

      "abstract": "Conditions are essential in the statements of biological literature. Without the conditions (e.g., environment, equipment) that were precisely specified, the facts (e.g., observations) in the statements may no longer be valid. One biological statement has one or multiple fact(s) and/or condition(s). Their subject and object can be either a concept or a concept's attribute. Existing information extraction methods do not consider the role of condition in the biological statement nor the role of attribute in the subject/object. In this work, we design a new tag schema and propose a deep sequence tagging framework to structure conditional statement into fact and condition tuples from biological text. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields a information-lossless structure of the literature.",

Reviews information can offer help in modeling user's preference and item's performance. Some existing methods utilize reviews for the recommendation. However, few of those models consider the importance of reviews and words in corpus together. Therefore, we propose an approach for rating prediction using a hierarchical attention-based network named HANN, which can distinguish the importance of reviews at both word level and review level for explanations automatically. Experiments on four real-life datasets from Amazon demonstrate that our model achieves an improvement in prediction compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. The hierarchical attention weights in sampled test data verify the effect on selecting informative words and reviews.",

      "abstract": "Distant supervision for relation extraction heavily suffers from the wrong labeling problem. To alleviate this issue in news data with the timestamp, we take a new factor time into consideration and propose a novel time-aware distant supervision framework (Time-DS). Time-DS is composed of a time series instance-popularity and two strategies. Instance-popularity is to encode the strong relevance of time and true relation mention. Therefore, instance-popularity would be an effective clue to reduce the noises generated through distant supervision labeling. The two strategies, i.e., hard filter and curriculum learning are both ways to implement instance-popularity for better relation extraction in the manner of Time-DS. The curriculum learning is a more sophisticated and flexible way to exploit instance-popularity to eliminate the bad effects of noises, thus get better relation extraction performance. Experiments on our collected multi-source news corpus show that Time-DS achieves significant improvements for relation extraction.",

      "abstract": "Attribute acquisition for classes is a key step in ontology construction, which is often achieved by community members manually. This paper investigates an attention-based automatic paradigm called TransATT for attribute acquisition, by learning the representation of hierarchical classes and attributes in Chinese ontology. The attributes of an entity can be acquired by merely inspecting its classes, because the entity can be regard as the instance of its classes and inherit their attributes. For explicitly describing of the class of an entity unambiguously, we propose class-path to represent the hierarchical classes in ontology, instead of the terminal class word of the hypernym-hyponym relation (i.e., is-a relation) based hierarchy. The high performance of TransATT on attribute acquisition indicates the promising ability of the learned representation of class-paths and attributes. Moreover, we construct a dataset named \\textbf{BigCilin11k}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Chinese dataset with abundant hierarchical classes and entities with attributes.",

      "abstract": "Question answering (QA) and question generation (QG) are closely related tasks that could improve each other; however, the connection of these two tasks is not well explored in the literature. In this paper, we present two training algorithms for learning better QA and QG models through leveraging one another. The first algorithm extends Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which selectively incorporates artificially generated instances as additional QA training data. The second algorithm is an extension of dual learning, which incorporates the probabilistic correlation of QA and QG as additional regularization in training objectives. To test the scalability of our algorithms, we conduct experiments on both document based and table based question answering tasks. Results show that both algorithms improve a QA model in terms of accuracy and QG model in terms of BLEU score. Moreover, we find that the performance of a QG model could be easily improved by a QA model via policy gradient, however, directly applying GAN that regards all the generated questions as negative instances could not improve the accuracy of the QA model. Our algorithm that selectively assigns labels to generated questions would bring a performance boost.",

      "abstract": "Facing lots of name mentions appearing on the web, entity linking is essential for many information processing applications. To improve linking accuracy, the relations between entities are usually considered in the linking process. This kind of method is called collective entity linking and can obtain high-quality results. There are two kinds of information helpful to reveal the relations between entities, i.e., contextual information and structural information of entities. Most traditional collective entity linking methods consider them separately. In fact, these two kinds of information represent entities from specific and diverse views and can enhance each other, respectively. Besides, if we look into each view closely, it can be separated into sub-views that are more meaningful. For this reason, this article proposes a multi-view–based collective entity linking algorithm, which combines several views of entities into an objective function for entity linking. The importance of each view can be valued and the linking results can be obtained along with resolving this objective function. Experimental results demonstrate that our linking algorithm can acquire higher accuracy than many state-of-the-art entity linking methods. Besides, since we simplify the entity's structure and change the entity linking to a sub-matrix searching problem, our algorithm also obtains high efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Abstract To analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities and outcomes of adult renal solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) treated at a single institution. Demographic, diagnostic, surgical, and pathological findings of patients who had undergone radical nephrectomy (RN) due to renal SFT were collected from the database of a single institution and were retrospectively reviewed. Ten patients (6 men and 4 women) were diagnosed with renal SFT in our institution between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. The mean age was 50.9 ± 8.2 years (range, 38–63 years). Of the 10 patients, 6 were asymptomatic, 2 presented with flank pain, 1 presented with abdominal discomfort, and 1 presented with haematuria. Computed tomography scans were obtained for all patients. Open RN was performed on 6 patients, and laparoscopic RN was performed on 4 patients. The mean tumor size was 10.23 ± 4 cm (range, 5.3–19 cm). Pathological diagnosis revealed that the tumors in 8 patients were benign, while those in the other 2 patients were malignant renal SFT. No recurrence occurred during a mean follow-up period of 47.3 ± 21.5 months (range, 16–85 months). Renal SFT is extremely rare, and its diagnosis may be challenging because of a lack of typical imaging manifestations. RN is a safe treatment modality for benign or low-grade malignant renal SFT, ensuring favorable outcomes.",

In this work, we propose a data augmentation technique by automatically generating relevant unanswerable questions according to an answerable question paired with its corresponding paragraph that contains the answer. We introduce a pair-to-sequence model for unanswerable question generation, which effectively captures the interactions between the question and the paragraph. We also present a way to construct training data for our question generation models by leveraging the existing reading comprehension dataset. Experimental results show that the pair-to-sequence model performs consistently better compared with the sequence-to-sequence baseline. We further use the automatically generated unanswerable questions as a means of data augmentation on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset, yielding 1.9 absolute F1 improvement with BERT-base model and 1.7 absolute F1 improvement with BERT-large model.",

      "abstract": "Though the community has made great progress on Machine Reading Comprehension\\n(MRC) task, most of the previous works are solving English-based MRC problems,\\nand there are few efforts on other languages mainly due to the lack of\\nlarge-scale training data. In this paper, we propose Cross-Lingual Machine\\nReading Comprehension (CLMRC) task for the languages other than English.\\nFirstly, we present several back-translation approaches for CLMRC task, which\\nis straightforward to adopt. However, to accurately align the answer into\\nanother language is difficult and could introduce additional noise. In this\\ncontext, we propose a novel model called Dual BERT, which takes advantage of\\nthe large-scale training data provided by rich-resource language (such as\\nEnglish) and learn the semantic relations between the passage and question in a\\nbilingual context, and then utilize the learned knowledge to improve reading\\ncomprehension performance of low-resource language. We conduct experiments on\\ntwo Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets CMRC 2018 and DRCD. The\\nresults show consistent and significant improvements over various\\nstate-of-the-art systems by a large margin, which demonstrate the potentials in\\nCLMRC task.

      "abstract": "As a recommendation problem, tag recommendation has been receiving increasing attention from both the business and academic communities. Traditional recommendation methods are inappropriate for folksonomy because the basis of such mechanism remains un-updated in time owing to the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition. Therefore, we propose a novel method of tag recommendation based on the topic hierarchy of folksonomy. The method applies the topic tag hierarchy constructed automatically from folksonomy to tag recommendation using the proposed strategy. The method can improve the quality of folksonomy and can evaluate the topic tag hierarchy through tag recommendation. The precision of tag recommendation reaches 0.892. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (t-test, p-value < 0.0001) and demonstrates effectiveness with respect to data sources on tag recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Machine reading comprehension (MRC) requires reasoning about both the knowledge involved in a document and knowledge about the world. However, existing datasets are typically dominated by questions that can be well solved by context matching, which fail to test this capability. To encourage the progress on knowledge-based reasoning in MRC, we present knowledge-based MRC in this paper, and build a new dataset consisting of 40,047 question-answer pairs. The annotation of this dataset is designed so that successfully answering the questions requires understanding and the knowledge involved in a document. We implement a framework consisting of both a question answering model and a question generation model, both of which take the knowledge extracted from the document as well as relevant facts from an external knowledge base such as Freebase/ProBase/Reverb/NELL. Results show that incorporating side information from external KB improves the accuracy of the baseline question answer system. We compare it with a standard MRC model BiDAF, and also provide the difficulty of the dataset and lay out remaining challenges.",

      "abstract": "Deriving pseudo causal relations from medical text data lies at the heart of medical literature mining. Existing studies have utilized extraction models to find pseudo causal relation from single sentences, while the knowledge created by causation transitivity - often spanning multiple sentences - has not been considered. Furthermore, we observe that many pseudo causal relations follow the rule of causation transitivity, which makes it possible to discover unseen casual relations and generate new causal relation hypotheses. In this paper, we address these two issues by proposing a factor graph model to incorporate three clues to discover causation expressions in the text data. We propose four types of triad structures to represent the rules of causation transitivity among causal relations. Our proposed model, called CausalTriad, uses textual and structural knowledge to infer pseudo causal relations from the triad structures. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that (a) CausalTriad is effective for pseudo causal relation discovery within and across sentences; (b) CausalTriad is highly capable at recognizing implicit pseudo causal relations; (c) CausalTriad can infer missing/new pseudo causal relations from text data.",

To address this, we develop a multi-topic aware long short-term memory (MTA-LSTM) network.In this model, we maintain a novel multi-topic coverage vector, which learns the weight of each topic and is sequentially updated during the decoding process.Afterwards this vector is fed to an attention model to guide the generator.Moreover, we automatically construct two paragraph-level Chinese essay corpora, 305,000 essay paragraphs and 55,000 question-and-answer pairs.Empirical results show that our approach obtains much better BLEU score compared to various baselines.Furthermore, human judgment shows that MTA-LSTM has the ability to generate essays that are not only coherent but also closely related to the input topics.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks have been widely used for high resource language (e.g. English) named entity recognition (NER) and have shown state-of-the-art results.However, for low resource languages, such as Dutch, Spanish, due to the limitation of resources and lack of annotated data, taggers tend to have lower performances.To narrow this gap, we propose three novel strategies to enrich the semantic representations of low resource languages: we first develop neural networks to improve low resource word representations by knowledge transfer from high resource language using bilingual lexicons. Further, a lexicon extension strategy is designed to address out-of lexicon problem by automatically learning semantic projections.Thirdly, we regard word-level entity type distribution features as an external language-independent knowledge and incorporate them into our neural architecture. Experiments on two low resource languages (including Dutch and Spanish) demonstrate the effectiveness of these additional semantic representations (average 4.8\\% improvement). Moreover, on Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 dataset, our approach achieved an F-score of 83.07\\% with 2.91\\% absolute gain compared to the state-of-the-art results.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effects and safety of intravitreal injection of Conbercept combined with macular grid pattern photocoagulation for macular edema secondary to non-ischemic branch retinal vein occlusion(BRVO). METHODS: A total of 38 patients(38 eyes )with macular edema following non-ischemic BRVO were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were given best corrected visual acuity(BCVA), intraocular pressure, slit lamp with preset lens, optic coherent tomography(OCT)and fluorescence fundus angiography(FFA)examination. The BCVA and central macular thickness(CMT)were observed before and 1wk, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12mo after treatment. The change in pre-treatment and post-treatment were compared, and the related complications were recorded. RESULTS:BCVA before treatment and 1wk, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12mo after treatment were 0.89±0.62, 0.64±0.59, 0.55±0.62, 0.46±0.43, 0.53±0.67, 0.43±0.38, 0.42±0.29, 0.40±0.30, the difference was statistically significant between that before and after treatment(<i>P</i><0.001), while the BCVA after treatment showed no significant difference with each other(<i>P</i>>0.05). CMT were 683.25±236.47, 298.65±116.12, 276.89±107.28, 281.55±99.62, 251.41±119.47, 240.58±88.62, 231.74±75.36, 209.51±84.68μm, the difference was statistically significant between that before and after treatment(<i>P</i><0.001), while the those after treatment showed no significant difference with each other(<i>P</i>>0.05). There were 11 eyes received one injection, 18 eyes with two injections, 2 eyes with 3, 3 eyes with 4, and 4 eyes more than 4, the average injection was 2.01±1.42. The CMT decreased after every injection. The intraocular hypertension and other complications were not seen after treatment. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal injection of conbercept combined with macular grid pattern photocoagulation for macular edema to non-ischemic BRVO can reduce the macular edema and improve BCVA, which is effective and safety.",

      "abstract": "Target-polarity word (T-P) collocation extraction is a basic sentiment analysis task, which aims to extract the targets and their modifying polarity words by analyzing the relationships between them. Recent studies rely primarily on syntactic rule matching. However, this kind of method has two disadvantages: (1) the syntactic rules are limited and hard matching is always used during the matching procedure that can result in the low recall value, and (2) this method omits the effect of the latent lexical semantic information on the T-P collocation extraction task. To solve the structured syntactic information loss and the lexical semantic information loss problems, in this paper we study the impact of syntactic and semantic information and incorporate them into kernels to automatically extract T-P collocations. We define a syntactic kernel based on the tree structures between targets and polarity words, and a semantic kernel based on the word semantic representations of them to exploit the good way to represent the two kinds of information with support vector machines. The experiments on four types of product reviews show that based on the basic features, a suitable combination of the syntactic and semantic kernels is very promising for T-P collocation extraction.",

We present the hierarchical attention flow to adequately leverage candidate options to model the interactions among passages, questions and candidate options. We observe that leveraging candidate options to boost evidence gathering from the passages play a vital role in this task, which is ignored in previous works. In addition, we explicitly model the option correlations with attention mechanism to obtain better option representations, which are further fed into a bilinear layer to obtain the ranking score for each option. On a large-scale multiple-choice reading comprehension dataset (i.e. the RACE dataset), the proposed model outperforms two previous neural network baselines on both RACE-M and RACE-H subsets and yields the state-of-the-art overall results.",

Our aligner is further tuned by our oracle parser via picking the alignment that leads to the highest-scored achievable AMR graph. Experimental results show that our aligner outperforms the rule-based aligner in previous work by achieving higher alignment F1 score and consistently improving two open-sourced AMR parsers. Based on our aligner and transition system, we develop a transition-based AMR parser that parses a sentence into its AMR graph directly. An ensemble of our parsers with only words and POS tags as input leads to 68.4 Smatch F1 score, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art parser.",

      "abstract": "Many natural language processing tasks can be modeled into structured prediction and solved as a search problem. In this paper, we distill an ensemble of multiple models trained with different initialization into a single model. In addition to learning to match the ensemble’s probability output on the reference states, we also use the ensemble to explore the search space and learn from the encountered states in the exploration. Experimental results on two typical search-based structured prediction tasks – transition-based dependency parsing and neural machine translation show that distillation can effectively improve the single model’s performance and the final model achieves improvements of 1.32 in LAS and 2.65 in BLEU score on these two tasks respectively over strong baselines and it outperforms the greedy structured prediction models in previous literatures.",

      "abstract": "Although end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved remarkable progress in the recent years, the idea of adopting multi-pass decoding mechanism into conventional NMT is not well explored. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called adaptive multi-pass decoder, which introduces a flexible multi-pass polishing mechanism to extend the capacity of NMT via reinforcement learning. More specifically, we adopt an extra policy network to automatically choose a suitable and effective number of decoding passes, according to the complexity of source sentences and the quality of the generated translations. Extensive experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive multi-pass decoder upon the conventional NMT with a significant improvement about 1.55 BLEU.",

Conventional methods for truth discovery mainly investigate the mutual effect between the reliability of sources and the credibility of statements. These methods use real numbers, which have a lower representation capability than vectors to represent the reliability. In addition, neural networks have not been used for truth discovery. In this work, we propose memory-network-based models to address truth discovery. Our proposed models use feedforward and feedback memory networks to learn the representation of the credibility of statements. Specifically, our models adopt a memory mechanism to learn the reliability of sources for truth prediction. The proposed models use categorical and continuous data during model learning by automatically assigning different weights to the loss function on the basis of their own effects. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform state-of-the-art methods for truth discovery.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks have been widely used for English name tagging and have delivered state-of-the-art results. However, for low resource languages, due to the limited resources and lack of training data, taggers tend to have lower performance, in comparison to the English language. In this paper, we tackle this challenging issue by incorporating multi-level cross-lingual knowledge as attention into a neural architecture, which guides low resource name tagging to achieve a better performance. Specifically, we regard entity type distribution as language independent and use bilingual lexicons to bridge cross-lingual semantic mapping. Then, we jointly apply word-level cross-lingual mutual influence and entity-type level monolingual word distributions to enhance low resource name tagging. Experiments on three languages demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural architecture: for Chinese, Uzbek, and Turkish, we are able to yield significant improvements in name tagging over all previous baselines.",

Typically it can be formalized as a multi-instance multi-label problem.In this paper, we introduce a novel neural approach for distant supervised (RE) with specific focus on attention mechanisms.Unlike the feature-based logistic regression model and compositional neural models such as CNN, our approach includes two major attention-based memory components, which is capable of explicitly capturing the importance of each context word for modeling the representation of the entity pair, as well as the intrinsic dependencies between relations.Such importance degree and dependency relationship are calculated with multiple computational layers, each of which is a neural attention model over an external memory. Experiment on real-world datasets shows that our approach performs significantly and consistently better than various baselines.",

      "abstract": "Online users have generated a large amount of health-related data on medical forums and search engines. However, exploiting these rich data for orienting patient online and assisting medical checkup offline is nontrivial due to the sparseness of existing symptom-disease links, which caused by the natural and chatty expressions of symptoms. In this paper, we propose a novel and general representation learning method ContextCare for human generated health-related data, which learns the latent relationship between symptoms and diseases from the symptom-disease diagnosis network for disease prediction, disease category prediction and disease clustering. To alleviate the network sparseness, ContextCare adopts regularizations from rich contextual information networks including a symptom co-occurrence network and a disease evolution network. Therefore, our representations of symptoms and diseases incorporate knowledge from these three networks. Extensive experiments on medical forum data demonstrate that ContextCare outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in disease category prediction, disease prediction and disease clustering.",

      "abstract": "Contradiction detection is a task to recognize contradiction relations between a pair of sentences. Despite the effectiveness of traditional context-based word embedding learning algorithms in many natural language processing tasks, such algorithms are not powerful enough for contradiction detection. Contrasting words such as “overfull” and “empty” are mostly mapped into close vectors in such embedding space. To solve this problem, we develop a tailored neural network to learn contradiction-specific word embedding (CWE). The method can separate antonyms in the opposite ends of a spectrum. CWE is learned from a training corpus which is automatically generated from the paraphrase database, and is naturally applied as features to carry out contradiction detection in SemEval 2014 benchmark dataset. Experimental results show that CWE outperforms traditional context-based word embedding in contradiction detection. The proposed model for contradiction detection performs comparably with the top-performing system in accuracy of three-category classification and enhances the accuracy from 75.97% to 82.08% in the contradiction category.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we formally define the problem of representing and leveraging abstract event causality to power downstream applications. We propose a novel solution to this problem, which build an abstract causality network and embed the causality network into a continuous vector space. The abstract causality network is generalized from a specific one, with abstract event nodes represented by frequently co-occurring word pairs. To perform the embedding task, we design a dual cause-effect transition model. Therefore, the proposed method can obtain general, frequent, and simple causality patterns, meanwhile, simplify event matching. Given the causality network and the learned embeddings, our model can be applied to a wide range of applications such as event prediction, event clustering and stock market movement prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that 1) the abstract causality network is effective for discovering high-level causality rules behind specific causal events; 2) the embedding models perform better than state-of-the-art link prediction techniques in predicting events; and 3) the event causality embedding is an easy-to-use and sophisticated feature for downstream applications such as stock market movement prediction.",

Different context words have different influences on determining the sentiment polarity of a sentence towards the target. Therefore, it is desirable to integrate the connections between target word and context words when building a learning system. In this paper, we develop two target dependent long short-term memory (LSTM) models, where target information is automatically taken into account. We evaluate our methods on a benchmark dataset from Twitter. Empirical results show that modeling sentence representation with standard LSTM does not perform well. Incorporating target information into LSTM can significantly boost the classification accuracy. The target-dependent LSTM models achieve state-of-the-art performances without using syntactic parser or external sentiment lexicons.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge base (KB) such as Freebase plays an important role for many natural language processing tasks. English knowledge base is obviously larger and of higher quality than low resource language like Chinese. To expand Chinese KB by leveraging English KB resources, an effective way is to translate English KB (source) into Chinese (target). In this direction, two major challenges are to model triple semantics and to build a robust KB translator. We address these challenges by presenting a neural network approach, which learns continuous triple representation with a gated neural network. Accordingly, source triples and target triples are mapped in the same semantic vector space. We build a new dataset for English-Chinese KB translation from Freebase, and compare with several baselines on it. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves translation accuracy compared with baseline methods. We show that adaptive composition model improves standard solution such as neural tensor network in terms of translation accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Product aspect recognition is a key task in fine-grained opinion mining. Current methods primarily focus on the extraction of aspects from the product reviews. However, it is also important to cluster synonymous extracted aspects into the same category. In this paper, we focus on the problem of product aspect clustering. The primary challenge is to properly cluster and generalize aspects that have similar meanings but different representations. To address this problem, we learn two types of background knowledge for each extracted aspect based on two types of effective aspect relations: relevant aspect relations and irrelevant aspect relations, which describe two different types of relationships between two aspects. Based on these two types of relationships, we can assign many relevant and irrelevant aspects into two different sets as the background knowledge to describe each product aspect. To obtain abundant background knowledge for each product aspect, we can enrich the available information with background knowledge from the Web. Then, we design a hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster these aspects into different groups, in which aspect similarity is computed using the relevant and irrelevant aspect sets for each product aspect. Experimental results obtained in both camera and mobile phone domains demonstrate that the proposed product aspect clustering method based on two types of background knowledge performs better than the baseline approach without the use of background knowledge. Moreover, the experimental results also indicate that expanding the available background knowledge using the Web is feasible.",

      "abstract": "Most existing supervised hashing methods learn the affinity‐preserving binary codes to represent the high‐dimensional data. However, each hashing code is assumed as independent and irrelevant with other codes. In practice, the authors find that there exists context association among hashing bits. This study proposes a novel hashing method dubbed kernelised supervised context hashing, which considers the hashing codes interrelation to reduce the quantisation. In this work, the kernel formulation is employed to tackle the high‐dimensional data which is mostly linear inseparable first; and then different distributions are utilised to describe the binary codes context; finally, the hashing codes can be approximated by gradient descent method iteratively. Therefore, the correlation between the hash codes is integrated to redefine the metric measurement (i.e. Hamming affinity) to preserve the data similarity in the raw space. The authors evaluate the proposed method on three image benchmarks CIFAR‐10, MNIST and NUS‐WIDE for image retrieval, and experimental results show that it achieves better performance than several other state‐of‐the‐art methods.",

Inspired by recently proposed HC-search framework, we decompose the incremental parsing algorithm into two steps: first searching a set of high-quality outputs with beam-search, and second selecting the best output with a ranking model. We learn our incremental parsing model with a relaxed learning objective. We incorporate arbitrary features in our ranking model and learn the model from fine grain ranking examples. Experimental results on standard English and Chinese datasets show our method significantly outperforms a strong baseline.",

      "abstract": "Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks can be generalized into segmentation problem. In this paper, we combine semi-CRF with neural network to solve NLP segmentation tasks. Our model represents a segment both by composing the input units and embedding the entire segment. We thoroughly study different composition functions and different segment embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on two typical segmentation tasks: named entity recognition (NER) and Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Experimental results show that our neural semi-CRF model benefits from representing the entire segment and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CWS benchmark dataset and competitive results on the CoNLL03 dataset.",

      "abstract": "Generating an article automatically with computer program is a challenging task in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. In this paper, we target at essay generation, which takes as input a topic word in mind and generates an organized article under the theme of the topic. We follow the idea of text planning \\cite{Reiter1997} and develop an essay generation framework. The framework consists of three components, including topic understanding, sentence extraction and sentence reordering. For each component, we studied several statistical algorithms and empirically compared between them in terms of qualitative or quantitative analysis. Although we run experiments on Chinese corpus, the method is language independent and can be easily adapted to other language. We lay out the remaining challenges and suggest avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "Target-dependent sentiment classification remains a challenge: modeling the semantic relatedness of a target with its context words in a sentence. Different context words have different influences on determining the sentiment polarity of a sentence towards the target. Therefore, it is desirable to integrate the connections between target word and context words when building a learning system. In this paper, we develop two target dependent long short-term memory (LSTM) models, where target information is automatically taken into account. We evaluate our methods on a benchmark dataset from Twitter. Empirical results show that modeling sentence representation with standard LSTM does not perform well. Incorporating target information into LSTM can significantly boost the classification accuracy. The target-dependent LSTM models achieve state-of-the-art performances without using syntactic parser or external sentiment lexicons.",

      "abstract": "Hashing plays an important role in image retrieval due to its fast search speed and low storage cost. In this paper, a new algorithm called Kernelized Iterative Hashing (KIH) is proposed for image retrieval, which takes account of kernel trick, and gets hash codes by iterative training. The kernel trick is used to map the image data from low-dimension into high-dimension cleverly. In this way that the data become linear separable and image retrieval achieves good performance when the hash codes are in low-dimension, by using iterative method to train hash codes, image data approach to hash codes step by step. The training error is reduced substantially and the hash codes are generated for image retrieval. The experimental results show that it decisively outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods on image benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) is an active research area in natural language processing. It aims at identifying, extracting and organizing sentiments from user generated texts in social networks, blogs or product reviews. A lot of studies in literature exploit machine learning approaches to solve sentiment analysis tasks from different perspectives in the past 15 years. Since the performance of a machine learner heavily depends on the choices of data representation, many studies devote to building powerful feature extractor with domain expert and careful engineering. Recently, deep learning approaches emerge as powerful computational models that discover intricate semantic representations of texts automatically from data without feature engineering. These approaches have improved the state‐of‐the‐art in many sentiment analysis tasks including sentiment classification of sentences/documents, sentiment extraction and sentiment lexicon learning. In this paper, we provide an overview of the successful deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis tasks, lay out the remaining challenges and provide some suggestions to address these challenges.

      "abstract": "We propose learning sentiment-specific word embeddings dubbed sentiment embeddings in this paper. Existing word embedding learning algorithms typically only use the contexts of words but ignore the sentiment of texts. It is problematic for sentiment analysis because the words with similar contexts but opposite sentiment polarity, such as <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">good</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bad</i> , are mapped to neighboring word vectors. We address this issue by encoding sentiment information of texts (e.g., sentences and words) together with contexts of words in sentiment embeddings. By combining context and sentiment level evidences, the nearest neighbors in sentiment embedding space are semantically similar and it favors words with the same sentiment polarity. In order to learn sentiment embeddings effectively, we develop a number of neural networks with tailoring loss functions, and collect massive texts automatically with sentiment signals like emoticons as the training data. Sentiment embeddings can be naturally used as word features for a variety of sentiment analysis tasks without feature engineering. We apply sentiment embeddings to word-level sentiment analysis, sentence level sentiment classification, and building sentiment lexicons. Experimental results show that sentiment embeddings consistently outperform context-based embeddings on several benchmark datasets of these tasks. This work provides insights on the design of neural networks for learning task-specific word embeddings in other natural language processing tasks.",

      "abstract": "For the robustness of visual object tracking, a new tracking algorithm based on multi-stage convolution filtering feature is proposed by introducing deep learning into visual tracking. The algorithm uses the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) eigenvectors obtained by stratified learning, to extract the deeper abstract expression of the original image by multi-stage convolutional filtering. Then the Bhattacharyya distance is used to evaluate the similarity among features. Finally, particle filter algorithm is combined to realize target tracking. The result shows that the feature obtained by multi-stage convolution filtering can express target better, the proposed algorithm has a better inflexibility to illumination, covering, rotation, and camera shake, and it exhibits very good robustness in video sequence with such characteristics.",

      "abstract": "We present a neural network method for review rating prediction in this paper. Existing neural network methods for sentiment prediction typically only capture the semantics of texts, but ignore the user who expresses the sentiment. This is not desirable for review rating prediction as each user has an influence on how to interpret the textual content of a review. For example, the same word (e.g. good) might indicate different sentiment strengths when written by different users. We address this issue by developing a new neural network that takes user information into account. The intuition is to factor in user-specific modification to the meaning of a certain word. Specifically, we extend the lexical semantic composition models and introduce a userword composition vector model (UWCVM), which effectively captures how user acts as a function affecting the continuous word representation. We integrate UWCVM into a supervised learning framework for review rating prediction, and conduct experiments on two benchmark review datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It shows superior performances over several strong baseline methods.",

However, different domains have different event type paradigms. When transferring to a new domain, we have to build a new event type paradigm and annotate a new corpus from scratch. This kind of conventional event extraction system requires massive human effort, and hence prevents event extraction from being widely applicable. In this paper, we present BUEES, a bottom-up event extraction system, which extracts events from the web in a completely unsupervised way. The system automatically builds an event type paradigm in the input corpus, and then proceeds to extract a large number of instance patterns of these events. Subsequently, the system extracts event arguments according to these patterns. By conducting a series of experiments, we demonstrate the good performance of BUEES and compare it to a state-of-the-art Chinese event extraction system, i.e., a supervised event extraction system. Experimental results show that BUEES performs comparably (5% higher F-measure in event type identification and 3% higher F-measure in event argument extraction), but without any human effort.",

However, previous work has always simply regarded the aspect as the target itself and has ignored the important \"object\" element. Thus, these studies have addressed incomplete targets, which are of limited use for practical applications. This paper proposes a novel and important sentiment analysis task, termed aspect-object alignment, to solve the \"object neglect\" problem. The objective of this task is to obtain the correct corresponding object for each aspect. We design a two-step framework for this task. We first provide an aspect-object alignment classifier that incorporates three sets of features, namely, the basic, relational, and special target features. However, the objects that are assigned to aspects in a sentence often contradict each other and possess many complicated features that are difficult to incorporate into a classifier. To resolve these conflicts, we impose two types of constraints in the second step: intra-sentence constraints and inter-sentence constraints. These constraints are encoded as linear formulations, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used as an inference procedure to obtain a final global decision that is consistent with the constraints. Experiments on a corpus in the camera domain demonstrate that the three feature sets used in the aspect-object alignment classifier are effective in improving its performance. Moreover, the classifier with ILP inference performs better than the classifier without it, thereby illustrating that the two types of constraints that we impose are beneficial.",

A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of such relations. This paper proposes a novel and effective method for the construction of semantic hierarchies based on continuous vector representation of words, named word embeddings, which can be used to measure the semantic relationship between words. We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym-hyponym relation by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words and their hypernyms. Our result, an F-score of 73.74%, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset. Moreover, combining our method with a previous manually built hierarchy extension method can further improve F-score to 80.29%.",

      "abstract": "Document level sentiment classification remains a challenge: encoding the intrinsic relations between sentences in the semantic meaning of a document. To address this, we introduce a neural network model to learn vector-based document representation in a unified, bottom-up fashion. The model first learns sentence representation with convolutional neural network or long short-term memory. Afterwards, semantics of sentences and their relations are adaptively encoded in document representation with gated recurrent neural network. We conduct document level sentiment classification on four large-scale review datasets from IMDB and Yelp Dataset Challenge. Experimental results show that: (1) our neural model shows superior performances over several state-of-the-art algorithms; (2) gated recurrent neural network dramatically outperforms standard recurrent neural network in document modeling for sentiment classification. 1",

      "abstract": "Syntactic linearization algorithms take a bag of input words and a set of optional constraints, and construct an output sentence and its syntactic derivation simultaneously.The search problem is NP-hard, and the current best results are achieved by bottom-up bestfirst search.One drawback of the method is low efficiency; and there is no theoretical guarantee that a full sentence can be found within bounded time.We propose an alternative algorithm that constructs output structures from left to right using beam-search.The algorithm is based on incremental parsing algorithms.We extend the transition system so that word ordering is performed in addition to syntactic parsing, resulting in a linearization system that runs in guaranteed quadratic time.In standard evaluations, our system runs an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art baseline using best-first search, with improved accuracies.",

Existing approaches to detect deceptive spam are concern on feature designing. Hand-crafted features can show some linguistic phenomenon, but is time-consuming and can not reveal the connotative semantic meaning of the review. We present a neural network to learn document-level representation. In our model, we not only learn to represent each sentence but also represent the whole document of the review. We apply traditional convolutional neural network to represent the semantic meaning of sentences. We present two variant convolutional neural-network models to learn the document representation. The model taking sentence importance into consideration shows the better performance in deceptive spam detection which enhances the value of F1 by 5 %.",

      "abstract": "Current online public opinion analysis systems can explore lots of hot events and present the public emotion distribution for each event, which are useful for the governments and companies. However, the public emotion distributions are just the shallow analysis of the hot events, more and more people want to know the hidden causation behind the emotion distributions. Thus, this paper presents a deep Event-Emotion analysis system on Microblogs to reveal what causes different emotions of a hot event. We here use several related sub-events to describe a hot event in different perspectives, accordingly these sub-events combined with their different emotion distributions can be used to explain the total emotion distribution of a hot event. Experiments on 15 hot events show that the above idea is reasonable to exploit the emotion causation and can help people better understand the evolution of the hot event. Furthermore, this deep Event-Emotion analysis system also tracks the amount treads and emotion treads of the hot event, and presents the deep analysis based on the user profile.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to build large-scale sentiment lexicon from Twitter with a representation learning approach. We cast sentiment lexicon learning as a phrase-level sentiment classification task. The challenges are developing effective feature representation of phrases and obtaining training data with minor manual annotations for building the sentiment classifier. Specifically, we develop a dedicated neural architecture and integrate the sentiment information of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) into its hybrid loss function for learning sentiment-specific phrase embedding (SSPE). The neural network is trained from massive tweets collected with positive and negative emoticons, without any manual annotation. Furthermore, we introduce the Urban Dictionary to expand a small number of sentiment seeds to obtain more training data for building the phrase-level sentiment classifier. We evaluate our sentiment lexicon (TS-Lex) by applying it in a supervised learning framework for Twitter sentiment classification. Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that, TS-Lex yields better performance than previously introduced sentiment lexicons.",

      "abstract": "Target-polarity word (T-P) collocation extraction, a basic sentiment analysis task, relies primarily on syntactic features to identify the relationships between targets and polarity words. A major problem of current research is that this task focuses on customer reviews, which are natural or spontaneous, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers. We address this problem by proposing a framework of adding a sentiment sentence compression (Sent Comp) step before performing T-P collocation extraction. Sent Comp seeks to remove the unnecessary information for senti-ment analysis, thereby compressing a complicated sentence into one that is shorter and easier to parse. We apply a discriminative conditional random field model, with some special sentiment-related features, in order to automatically compress sentiment sentences. Experiments show that Sent Comp significantly improves the performance of T-P collocation extraction. 1",

      "abstract": "Document enrichment is the task of retrieving additional knowledge from external resource over what is available through source document. This task is essential because of the phenomenon that text is generally replete with gaps and ellipses since authors assume a certain amount of background knowledge. The recovery of these gaps is intuitively useful for better understanding of document. Conventional document enrichment techniques usually rely on Wikipedia which has great coverage but less accuracy, or Ontology which has great accuracy but less cover-age. In this study, we propose a document enrichment framework which automatically extracts “argument1, predicate, argument2 ” triple from any text corpus as background knowledge, so that to ensure the compatibility with any resource (e.g. news text, ontology, and on-line ency-clopedia) and improve the enriching accuracy. We first incorporate source document and back-ground knowledge together into a triple based document-level graph and then propose a global iterative ranking model to propagate relevance score and select the most relevant knowledge triple. We evaluate our model as a ranking problem and compute the MAP and P&amp;amp;N score to validate the ranking result. Our final result, a MAP score of 0.676 and P&amp;amp;20 score of 0.417 outperform a strong baseline based on search engine by 0.182 in MAP and 0.04 in P&amp;amp;20. 1",

      "abstract": "Tibetan kefir grains (TKGs), a kind of natural starter for fermented milk in Tibet, China, host various microorganisms of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and occasionally acetic acid bacteria in a polysaccharide/protein matrix. In the present study, the fine structure of TKGs was studied to shed light on this unusual symbiosis with stereomicroscopy and thin sections. The results reveal that TKGs consist of numerous small grain units, which are characterized by a hollow globular structure with a diameter between 2.0 and 9.0 mm and a wall thickness of approximately 200 µm. A polyhedron-like net structure, formed mainly by the bacteria, was observed in the wall of the grain units, which has not been reported previously to our knowledge. Towards the inside of the grain unit, the polyhedron-like net structures became gradually larger in diameter and fewer in number. Such fine structures may play a crucial role in the stability of the grains. Subsequently, the distribution, diversity, and shift of yeasts in TKGs were investigated based on thin section, scanning electron microscopy, cloning and sequencing of D1/D2 of the 26S rRNA gene, real-time quantitative PCR, and in situ hybridization with specific fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probes. These show that (i) yeasts appear to localize on the outer surface of the grains and grow normally together to form colonies embedded in the bacterial community; (ii) the diversity of yeasts is relatively low on genus level with three dominant species--Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, and Yarrowia lipolytica; (iii) S. cerevisiae is the stable predominant yeast species, while the composition of Kluyveromyces and Yarrowia are subject to change over time. Our results indicate that TKGs are relatively stable in structure, and culture conditions to some extent shape the microbial community and interaction in kefir grains. These findings pave the way for further study of the specific symbiotic associations between S. cerevisiae and Lactobacillus bacteria in TKGs.",

      "abstract": "Writing comments on products or news has become a popular activity in social media. The amount of opinionated text available online has been growing rapidly, increasing the need for techniques that can analyze opinions expressed in such text so that reviews can be easily absorbed by users. To date, most techniques depend on annotated corpora. However, existing corpora are almost sentence-level works that ignore important global sentiment information in other sentences. Given the rise of advanced applications, more fine-grained corpora are needed, even at the sentence level. The authors aim to create a fine-grained corpus for Chinese sentiment analysis, and more importantly, explore new sentiment analysis tasks by analyzing the annotated corpus. The proposed fine-grained annotation scheme not only introduces cross-sentence and global sentiment information (such as \"target entity\"') but also includes new sentence-level elements (such as \"implicit aspect\"). Based on this scheme, this corpus can provide a more fine-grained platform for researchers to study algorithms for advanced applications. In addition, an in-depth analysis on the annotated corpus is made and several important but ignored tasks, such as the target-aspect pair extraction task, are explored, which can give useful hints about future directions.",

In order to analyze the emotional changes in accordance with time and space, this paper presents an Emotion Analysis Platform (EAP), which explores the emotional distribution of each province, so that can monitor the global pulse of each province in China. The massive data of Weibo and the real-time requirements make the building of EAP challenging. In order to solve the above problems, emoticons, emotion lexicon and emotion-shifting rules are adopted in EAP to analyze the emotion of each tweet. In order to verify the effectiveness of the platform, case study on the Sichuan earthquake is done, and the analysis result of the platform accords with the fact. In order to analyze from quantity, we manually annotate a test set and conduct experiment on it. The experimental results show that the macro-Precision of EAP reaches 80% and the EAP works effectively.",

      "abstract": "Background: From November 2011 to January 2012, a number of clustering cases of HCV infection were reported in Zijin County, Heyuan City, Guangdong, China.Most patients in the clustering cases suspected that they could be infected due to inappropriate medical care in the clinic located at the Xiangshui road.However, the molecular epidemiology of the clustering cases remains unknown. Methodology:The residents, living at Xiangshui Road, with HCV antibody positive reported from 2011 and 2012 were recruited.A survey of the HCV infected individuals from the clustering cases was conducted.Each participant underwent a questionnaire defining demographic characteristics and health care history.HCV serological test and viral load test were performed to confirm the infection status.Molecular phylogenetic analysis and Bayesian coalescence analysis were conducted to further confirm the HCV subtype distribution and to reconstruct the associated demographic history and time-scaled phylogeny among the clustering cases. Principal Findings:The molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that only two HCV subtypes, 2a and 6a, were found among the clustering cases.There was no close HCV subtype evolutionary relation was observed among patients from the same family.The 6a cluster showed higher viral loads than the 2a cluster.In addition, the Bayesian skyline plot analysis showed that both the HCV 2a and 6a subtype infections among the Heyuan cases experienced an \"expansion-diminishment-expansion\" featured dissemination.The 2a clustering infection occurred in 2004, and the 6a clustering cases originated in 2006. Conclusions:The molecular epidemiological characters imply that the inappropriate medical practices were possibly associated with the clustering HCV cases in Heyuan City during 2011, 2012.Latent HCV subtypes 2a and 6a infection may cause the prevalence and become a new public health issue in Guangdong, China.",

      "abstract": "We present a method that learns word em-bedding for Twitter sentiment classifica-tion in this paper. Most existing algorithm-s for learning continuous word represen-tations typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentimen-t of text. This is problematic for senti-ment analysis as they usually map word-s with similar syntactic context but oppo-site sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors. We address this issue by learning sentiment-specific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes sentiment information in the con-tinuous representation of words. Specif-ically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sen-tences or tweets) in their loss function-s. To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentiment-specific word em-bedding from massive distant-supervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons. Experiments on applying SS-WE to a benchmark Twitter sentimen-t classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that (1) the SSWE feature performs comparably with hand-crafted features in the top-performed system; (2) the perfor-mance is further improved by concatenat-ing SSWE with existing feature set. 1",

Among the 45 sub-mitted systems including the SemEval 2013 participants, our system (Coooolll) is ranked 2nd on the Twitter2014 test set of SemEval 2014 Task 9. Coooolll is built in a supervised learning framework by concatenating the sentiment-specific word embedding (SSWE) features with the state-of-the-art hand-crafted features. We develop a neural network with hybrid loss function 1 to learn SSWE, which en-codes the sentiment information of tweets in the continuous representation of words. To obtain large-scale training corpora, we train SSWE from 10M tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons, without any manual annotation. Our system can be easily re-implemented with the publicly available sentiment-specific word embed-ding. 1",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a joint segmenta-tion and classification framework for sen-timent analysis. Existing sentiment clas-sification algorithms typically split a sen-tence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent senti-ment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as “not bad ” and “a great deal of ”. We address this issue by developing a joint segmentation and classification framework (JSC), which si-multaneously conducts sentence segmen-tation and sentence-level sentiment classi-fication. Specifically, we use a log-linear model to score each segmentation candi-date, and exploit the phrasal information of top-ranked segmentations as features to build the sentiment classifier. A marginal log-likelihood objective function is de-vised for the segmentation model, which is optimized for enhancing the sentiment classification performance. The joint mod-el is trained only based on the annotat-ed sentiment polarity of sentences, with-out any segmentation annotations. Experi-ments on a benchmark Twitter sentimen-t classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that, our joint model performs com-parably with the state-of-the-art methods. 1",

However, different domains have different event type paradigms. When transferring to a new domain, we have to build a new event type paradigm. It is a costly task to discover and annotate event types manually. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach of building an event type para- digm by clustering event triggers. Based on the trigger clusters, the event type paradigm can be built automatically. Experimental re- sults on three different corpora - ACE (small, homogeneous, open corpus), Financial News and Musical News (large scale, specific do- main, web corpus) indicate that our method can effectively build an event type paradigm and can be easily adapted to new domains.",

Moreover, building a single ontology for multiple-topic corpus may lead to misconception. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework to extract topical key concepts from folksonomy. Folksonomy is a valuable data source due to real-time update and rich user-generated contents. We first identify topics from folksonomy using topic models. Next the tags are ranked according to their importance for a certain topic by applying topic-specific random walk methods. The top-ranking tags are extracted as topical key concepts. Especially, a novel link weight function which combines the local structure information and global semantic similarity is proposed in importance score propagation. From the perspectives of qualitative and quantitative investigation, our method is feasible and effective.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the automatic extraction of domain-specific sentiment word (DSSW), which is a fundamental subtask of sentiment analysis. Most previous work utilizes manual patterns for this task. However, the performance of those methods highly relies on the labelled patterns or selected seeds. In order to overcome the above problem, this paper presents an automatic framework to detect large-scale domain-specific patterns for DSSW extraction. To this end, sentiment seeds are extracted from massive dataset of user comments. Subsequently, these sentiment seeds are expanded by synonyms using a bootstrapping mechanism. Simultaneously, a synonymy graph is built and the graph propagation algorithm is applied on the built synonymy graph. Afterwards, syntactic and sequential relations between target words and high-ranked sentiment words are extracted automatically to construct large-scale patterns, which are further used to extracte DSSWs. The experimental results in three domains reveal the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Hypernym discovery aims to extract such noun pairs that one noun is a hypernym of the other. Most previous methods are based on lexical patterns but perform badly on opendomain data. Other work extracts hypernym relations from encyclopedias but has limited coverage. This paper proposes a simple yet effective distant supervision framework for Chinese open-domain hypernym discovery. Given an entity name, we try to discover its hypernyms by leveraging knowledge from multiple sources, i.e., search engine results, encyclopedias, and morphology of the entity name. First, we extract candidate hypernyms from the above sources. Then, we apply a statistical ranking model to select correct hypernyms. A set of novel features is proposed for the ranking model. We also present a heuristic strategy to build a large-scale noisy training data for the model without human annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset.",

Entity linking in long text has been well studied in previous works. However few work has focused on short text such as microblog post. Microblog posts are short and noisy. Previous method can extract few features from the post context. In this paper we propose to use extra posts for the microblog entity linking task. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves the linking accuracy over traditional methods by 8.3% and 7.5% respectively.",

However, retrieving relevant results from such data is a challenging problem due to the unstructured language of the web queries. In this paper, we propose a method to improve web search ranking by detecting Structured Annotation of queries based on top search results. In a structured annotation, the original query is split into different units that are associated with semantic attributes in the corresponding domain. We evaluate our techniques using real world queries and achieve significant improvement.",

To deal with this problem, we present an instance based dynamic generalization algorithm (IDGen). IDGen constructs an exclusive model level by level automatically for every single instance withthegenerationpointscreatedfromthefeatures.

The collocation refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and a target (such as ⟨long, battery life ⟩ or ⟨long, startup⟩), in which the sentiment orientation of the polarity word (“long”) changes along with different targets (“battery life ” or “startup”). To disambiguate a collocation’s polarity, previous work always turned to investigate the polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation. However, these contexts are limited, thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be reliable. We therefore propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand some pseudo contexts from web, to help disambiguate a collocation’s polarity.Without using any additional labeled data, experiments show that our method is effective. 1",

Abstract:Different from previous works such as hand-crafted patterns and rule based methods, this paper proposes a novel method that uses syntactic paths to automatically recognize the appraisal expressions. In detail, the syntactic paths are first automatically collected to describe the relationships between the polarity words and their corresponding targets. Next, an edit distance based syntactic path matching strategy is used to improve the performance of the exact syntactic path matching method. Experimental results on the camera and MP3 player domains show that (1) syntactic paths are helpful for appraisal expression recognition, and (2) edit distance based syntactic path matching method can further improve the performance of appraisal expression recognition. 参考文献 相似文献 引证文献",

Experiments show that the proposed approach is effective. 1",

This paper describes a method based on automatic expansion of the event triggers for event type recognition. The event triggers are first extended through a thesaurus to enable the extraction of the candidate events and their candidate types. Then, a binary classification method is used to recognize the candidate event types. This method effectively improves the unbalanced data problem in training models and the data sparseness problem with a small corpus. Evaluations on the ACE2005 dataset give a final F-score of 61.24%, which outperforms traditional methods based on pure machine learning.",

Methods A total of 155 Chinese (han) children with GEFS+ and 135 normal control subjects were included in the study. A PCR amplicons including the 7 exon and flanking intronic splice site have been screened by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). For those with abnormal elution peak,direct sequence analysis was performed. SPSS 11.5 was used to determine the difference between the two groups. Results In normal group,SCN1A Exon 7 -21 CT:CC,CT and TT genotype frequencies were 0.474,0.444 and 0.082,respectively. SCN1A Exon 7 -21 CT C and G Gene frequencies were 0.696,0.304,respectively; while in GEFS+ group,SCN1A Exon 7 -21 CT:CC,CT and TT genotype frequencies were 0.490,0.439 and 0.071,respectively. SCN1A Exon 7 -21 CT C and G Gene frequencies were 0.710 and 0.290,respectively. The results showed that genotypes and allelic frequencies for the SCN1A gene polymorphisms in both groups were not significantly different. Conclusion Our study suggests that the SCN1A single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) Exon 7 -21 CT might not be one of the susceptibility factors for GEFS+.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised-learning based coreference resolution obviates the need for annotation of training data. However, unsupervised approaches have traditionally been relying on the use of mention-pair models, which only consider information pertaining to a pair of mentions at a time. In this paper, it is proposed the use of hypergraph partitioning to overcome this limitation. The mentions are modeled as vertices. By allowing a hyperedge to cover multiple mentions that share a common property, the additional information beyond a mention pair can be captured. This paper introduces a hypergraph partitioning algorithm that divides mentions directly into equivalence classes representing individual entities. Evaluation on the ACE dataset shows that our unsupervised hypergraph based approach outperforms previous unsupervised methods.",

The results show that Zr element exists mainly in single and cluster particles of pure α‐Zr or Zn‐Zr compounds inside grains and at grain boundaries. Only the particles located in the interior of grains can act as the nucleus for α‐Mg growth and effectively promote the formation of fine equiaxed grains. The broken and dispersed Zr‐rich particles produced during the hot extrusion process can form nebulous banded structure in which these fine particles may act as obstacles to dislocation motion in wrought magnesium alloys.",

Syntactic Dependency ParsingWe extend our CoNLL 2008 graph-based model (Che et al., 2008) in four ways:1. We use bigram features to choose multiple possible syntactic labels for one arc, and decide the optimal label during decoding.2. We extend the model with sibling features (Mc-Donald, 2006).3. We extend the model with grandchildren features.Rather than only using the left-most and rightmost grandchildren as Carreras (2007) and Johansson and Nugues (2008) did, we use all left and right grandchildren in our model.4. We adopt the pseudo-projective approach introduced in (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005) to handle the non-projective languages including Czech, German and English. Syntactic Label Determining",

A novel \"polarityword-target\" related feature extraction method is proposed. An opinion judgment system is then built based on the sentiment of each sentence predicted by a maximum entropy (ME) classifier with the novel features. The experimental results on two domains show that the special feature extraction methods are promising; the opinion judgment system with 91.5% average accuracy is highly effective.",

      "abstract": "The update summary as defined for the DUC2007 new task aims to capture evolving information of a single topic over time.It delivers focused information to a user who has already read a set of older documents covering the same topic.This paper presents a novel manifold-ranking frame based on iterative feedback mechanism to this summary task.The topic set is extended by using the summarization of previous timeslices and the first sentences of documents in current timeslice.Iterative feedback mechanism is applied to model the dynamically evolving characteristic and represent the relay propagation of information in temporally evolving data.Modified manifold-ranking process also can naturally make use of both the relationships among all the sentences in the documents and relationships between the topic and the sentences.The ranking score for each sentence obtained in the manifold-ranking process denotes the importance of sentence biased towards topic, and then the greedy algorithm is employed to rerank the sentences for removing the redundant information.The summary is produced by choosing the sentences with high ranking score.Experiments on dataset of DUC2007 update task demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed approach.",

A first-order projective MSTParser is used as our syntactic dependency parser. In order to overcome the shortcoming of the MSTParser, that it cannot model more global information, we add a relabeling stage after the parsing to distinguish some confusable labels, such as ADV, TMP, and LOC. Besides adding a predicate identification and a classification stages, our semantic dependency parsing simplifies the traditional four stages semantic role labeling into two: a maximum entropy based argument classification and an ILP-based post inference. Finally, we gain the overall labeled macro F1 = 82.66, which ranked the second position in the closed challenge.",

It delivers salient and novel information to a user who has already read a set of older documents covering the same topic. According to the new challenges brought by update summary, we propose the evolutionary manifold-ranking algorithm, and further integrate the sub-topics partition with spectral clustering to have a content selection, which is completely language independence. Three systems: 11, 41 and 62 are submitted. Our best system ranks three top 1 under average modified (pyramid) score, average numSCUs and macro-average modified score with 3 models of PYRAMID, ranks 13 th in ROUGE-2, ranks 15 th in ROUGE-SU4 and ranks 17 th in BE. Though the evaluation results show the interesting performance of the proposed method, yet the problem is far from solved. 1.",

      "abstract": "Intra-document coreference resolution, which is the process of partitioning intra-document mentions into different real world entities, includes personal pronoun resolution and noun phrase resolution, and is always one of the key problems of natural language processing. In recent years, there have been extensive studies and rapid progresses in coreference resolution. After distinguishing several related concepts and summarizing the basic coreference types, this paper analyses the past 30 years research line on coreference resolution. It is pointed out that the current key problems and research trends are global optimization, the use of deep linguistical and background knowledge, and the combination of linguistical models and statistical models. Finally, the related international evaluations, evaluation metrics, related corpora and tools are described in detail. Key words Intra-document coreference resolution; personal pronoun resolution; noun phrase",
