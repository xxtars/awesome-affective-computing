Key trends include: (1) integrating vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4V, AffectGPT, Emotion-LLaMA) for zero-shot, open-vocabulary, and instruction-tuned emotion reasoning; (2) addressing real-world challenges like missing modalities, noise, and data scarcity via dynamic curriculum learning, contrastive masking, graph completion, and modality-invariant fusion; (3) prioritizing interpretability, explainability, and psychological grounding in model design and evaluation; (4) expanding beyond discrete classification to fine-grained, dimensional, compound, and joint emotion-intent-personality modeling; and (5) emphasizing responsible deployment—including ethics, privacy, clinical applicability (e.g., depression severity prediction), and cross-cultural/human-centered design.",

      "abstract": "• Proposes a multi-objective disruption management framework for LRMSAR. • Integrates stakeholder satisfaction, workload balance, and cost efficiency. • Formulates a realistic ILP model with organizational, technical, and environmental constraints. • Introduces an enhanced evolutionary algorithm with adaptive operators for rapid convergence. • Demonstrates effectiveness via a Bohai Sea capsized vessel case study. Long-range maritime search and rescue operations face critical challenges due to coastal distance, unpredictable weather, and limited resources. Disturbances such as resource failures or adverse conditions often render initial resource allocations ineffective, necessitating robust reallocation strategies. To address this, we propose a novel disruption management framework that employs a multi-objective reallocation model jointly optimizing operational efficiency, stakeholder equity, and plan stability. To solve this model, we introduce an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves approximately 98% reduction in Inverted Generational Distance compared to the classic algorithm, significantly improving optimization quality. In the Bohai Sea fishing boat capsizing case, our reallocation strategy successfully limited the increase in victim dissatisfaction to only 0.23. The reallocation results keep the victim dissatisfaction deviation and resources budget are both controlled rightly, demonstrating the framework’s superior adaptability and practical value. This research provides decision-makers with a robust, data-driven tool for managing disruptions in maritime emergency operations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In advanced DRAM and NAND structures, the feature size at the targeted cut face during the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) process has been reduced to sub-ten nanometer scale. Even with high-quality SEM resolution level scanned cut-face image data, determining the stopping point of the process remains a significant challenge. To address this, Micron has successfully implemented cut-face probability calculation and sliced image data interpolation methods using machine vision image artificial intelligence platforms (AIPs by Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the Micron’s latest memory devices analysis. This innovation enables machines to render a device’s three-dimensional geometry, infer and predict the upcoming cut face in SEM data points, and determine the stopping point in the FIB thinning process using detector’s raw data signal extractions. This approach avoids signal post-processing and transformation into visible light range for humans, thereby preventing meaningful data loss. The new methodology surpasses human eye detection limits, maximizes SEM resolution utilization, and converts an automation system into an autonomous system capable of deciding where to stop the FIB milling at each cut-face, based on the sensory input of Micron wafer’s cut-face analysis and learning algorithms. This technology has been integrated into its associated FIB platform, augmented by Open-AutoTEM, (iFast Extensibility). Micron defines this autonomous FIB thinning as active auto thinning (AAT), distinguishing it from the conventional fiducial-based FIB auto thinning, known as passive auto thinning (PAT).",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized numerous research fields, including computer vision and affective computing. As a pivotal challenge in this interdisciplinary domain, facial expression recognition (FER) has evolved from separate, domain-specific models to more unified approaches. One promising avenue to unify FER tasks is converting conventional FER datasets into visual question-answering (VQA) formats, enabling the direct application of powerful generalist MLLMs for inference. However, despite the success of cutting-edge MLLMs in various tasks, their performance on FER tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we provide FERBench, a systematic benchmark that incorporates 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs across four widely used FER datasets. Our results reveal that, while MLLMs exhibit good classification performance, they still face significant limitations in reasoning and interpretability. To this end, we introduce post-training strategies aimed at enhancing the facial expression reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we curate two high-quality and large-scale datasets: UniFER-CoT-230K for cold-start initialization and UniFER-RLVR-360K for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), respectively. Building upon them, we develop a unified and interpretable FER foundation model termed UniFER-7B, which outperforms many open-sourced and closed-source generalist MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro and Qwen2.5-VL-72B).",

      "abstract": "Audio deepfake detection (ADD) has grown increasingly important due to the rise of high-fidelity audio generative models and their potential for misuse. Given that audio large language models (ALLMs) have made significant progress in various audio processing tasks, a heuristic question arises: Can ALLMs be leveraged to solve ADD?. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of ALLMs on ADD, revealing their ineffectiveness. To this end, we propose ALLM4ADD, an ALLM-driven framework for ADD. Specifically, we reformulate ADD task as an audio question answering problem, prompting the model with the question: ''Is this audio fake or real?''. We then perform supervised fine-tuning to enable the ALLM to assess the authenticity of query audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our ALLM-based method can achieve superior performance in fake audio detection, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. As a pioneering study, we anticipate that this work will inspire the research community to leverage ALLMs to develop more effective ADD systems.

Previously, MER2023 (http://merchallenge.cn/mer2023) focused on multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning, while MER2024 (https://zeroqiaoba.github.io/MER2024-website) introduced a new track dedicated to open-vocabulary emotion recognition. This year, MER2025 centers on the theme ''When Affective Computing Meets Large Language Models (LLMs)''. We aim to shift the paradigm from traditional categorical frameworks reliant on predefined emotion taxonomies to LLM-driven generative methods, offering innovative solutions for more accurate and reliable emotion understanding. The challenge contains four tracks: MER-SEMI focuses on fixed categorical emotion recognition enhanced by semi-supervised learning; MER-FG explores fine-grained emotions, expanding recognition from basic to nuanced emotional states; MER-DES incorporates multimodal cues (beyond emotion words) into predictions to enhance model interpretability; MER-PR reveals whether emotion prediction results can improve personality recognition performance. For the first three tracks, the baseline code is available at MERTools (https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/MERTools) and datasets can be accessed via Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MERChallenge/MER2025). For the last track, the dataset and baseline code are available on GitHub (https://github.com/cai-cong/MER25_personality).",

      "abstract": "Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information). Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal, generative, and responsible affective computing aims to enhance people's lives. In recent years, the AI revolution has already begun to impact daily life, with virtual assistants being deployed across various sectors such as healthcare, banking, transportation, and education. It is clear that, in the near future, humans may interact with AI-powered systems as much or maybe even more than direct human-to-human interactions. Affective computing has numerous applications, including innovative approaches to forecasting and preventing anxiety, stress, and mental health issues; enhancing robotic empathy; assisting individuals with communication, behavior, and emotion regulation challenges; and promoting awareness of health and well-being. Many of these applications require enhanced control and protection of sensitive, private, and personal data. Therefore, it is crucial to further develop the creation, evaluation, and deployment of emotionally intelligent systems that are both responsive and responsible. Additionally, improving the accuracy and interpretability of emotion prediction results can significantly enhance the application of this technology in the downstream tasks mentioned above. MRAC'25 is the continuation of MRAC'23 and MRAC'24. Through this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers to discuss the potential and development of affective computing.",

      "abstract": "This study proposes an LLM-augmented hierarchical fusion framework to enhance multimodal personality and ability assessment for the ACM MULTIMEDIA AVI CHALLENGE 2025, addressing semantic sparsity and cross-modal interaction limitations. We leverage large language models (e.g., Qwen, DeepSeek) to generate psychologically enriched text descriptions, bridging raw transcripts with expert evaluations, and integrate them with audio-visual features through early fusion and multi-path MLP ensembles. Track 1 (personality regression) employs dual-text inputs while Track 2 (multi-label ability prediction) uses parallel regression. Results show significant improvements: 23.1% MSE reduction over text-only baselines in Track 1, and 10.7%/12.5% gains over state-of-the-art fusion in Tracks 1/2, with 31.2% average improvement for cognitive traits (Q3-Q5). The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of semantic enhancement and adaptive fusion, with future work focusing on overfitting mitigation and feature optimization.",

      "abstract": "Partial label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning, where each sample is associated with a set of candidate labels. Its basic assumption is that the ground-truth label must be in the candidate set, but this assumption may not be satisfied due to the unprofessional judgment of annotators. Therefore, we relax this assumption and focus on a more general task, noisy PLL, where the ground-truth label may not exist in the candidate set. To address this challenging task, we propose a novel framework called \"Iterative Refinement Network (IRNet)\", aiming to purify noisy samples through two key modules (i.e., noisy sample detection and label correction). To achieve better performance, we exploit smoothness constraints to reduce prediction errors in these modules. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that IRNet is able to reduce the noise level of the dataset and eventually approximate the Bayes optimal classifier. Meanwhile, IRNet is a plug-in strategy that can be integrated with existing PLL approaches. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that IRNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on noisy PLL.",

      "abstract": "La Imagen en el Dominio de la Frecuencia Espacial (SFDI, Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging) es una técnica óptica no invasiva con gran potencial para aplicaciones médicas. Permite extraer propiedades de absorción y dispersión del tejido mediante la proyección de patrones de luz estructurados y el análisis de las señales reflejadas. Sin embargo, la implementación en tiempo real de SFDI suele ser un requisito en aplicaciones médicas y aún se encuentra en fase experimental. Un estudio en curso sobre la implementación de SFDI con una cámara hiperespectral (HS, Hyperspectral Camera) ha revelado desafíos clave: lograr una proyección de patrones estable a altas tasas de cuadros (FRR, Frame Refresh Rate) y asegurar una medición precisa de la distancia entre el proyector y la superficie. Este proyecto desarrolla los subsistemas principales de un prototipo SFDI sobre una plataforma SoC (System-on-Chip) con Linux embebido. Este entorno ofrece mayor flexibilidad para el desarrollo futuro, permitiendo la integración directa de bibliotecas externas y controladores de dispositivos. La proyección de patrones debe ajustarse según la distancia entre el proyector y la superficie; por ello, se integró un sensor de Tiempo de Vuelo (ToF, Time-of-Flight). Los objetivos principales fueron desarrollar un módulo Baremetal para la medición de distancia con ToF, integrarlo con el módulo de proyección de patrones existente, y migrar todo el sistema al entorno SoC con Linux embebido. Esta migración es necesaria para soportar interfaces de dispositivos más complejas en el futuro, como una cámara HS USB. Durante el proyecto se enfrentaron dos desafíos importantes. Primero, las lecturas iniciales del sensor ToF presentaban errores significativos. Segundo, el desarrollo de un programa de control eficiente en espacio de usuario sobre Linux embebido para gestionar tanto el sensor ToF como el generador de patrones basado en HLS (High-Level Synthesis) resultó complejo. Se implementó una solución simple y eficaz que resolvió ambos problemas. La implementación final logró una tolerancia de error en la medición de distancia dentro de un ±3% y alcanzó una FRR de aproximadamente 58 Hz en la proyección de patrones, con capacidad de respuesta a cambios en los parámetros de fase desde el control por SW en un entorno Linux. Para validar este comportamiento, se generaron patrones con fases (0,2π/3 y 4π/3) a una distancia de trabajo fija, tanto en la plataforma Baremetal como en la plataforma Embedded Linux. Los resultados fueron comparados visualmente para confirmar la consistencia entre ambos entornos. Estos resultados demuestran que una plataforma SoC con Linux embebido puede soportar de manera confiable el control de patrones sensible a la distancia en subsistemas SFDI. Este trabajo sienta las bases para la futura integración de adquisición de imágenes, procesamiento en tiempo real y extracción de propiedades ópticas en un sistema SFDI completamente embebido.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigated the stability and dynamic response of the free end of rigid risers used in deep-sea mining operations, focusing on extracting polymetallic nodules from 6000 m around Minamitorisima Island, Japan. To simulate the dynamic behavior, we first hypothesized the wave height and wave period interval based on the Airy theory and incorporated the current by power law method. Then we established a model composed of Vessel, Riser, and Buffer in the FDM software to evaluate the hang-off configuration’s behavior of the riser by time domain simulation, involving bending moment, effective tension, lateral lateral displacement and steady state, under regular wave and current condition. In addition, the factors influencing the riser bottom’s dynamics were estimated quantitatively, like the buffer mass (connect to the bottom). The results revealed that the buffer mass significantly impacted the bottom’s dynamic behavior, reducing the maximum bending moment and lateral displacement while increasing the holistic effective tension. Besides that, in most cases with different buffer masses, after approximately 2500 seconds from the start of the simulation, the dynamic changes of the riser bottom began to exhibit periodicity and fluctuate within a relatively fixed numerical range. The findings suggest that the optimal buffer mass of 25% to 30% riser mass could offer enhanced stability and reliability for deep-sea mining operations.",

      "abstract": "Different annotators often assign different labels to the same sample due to backgrounds or preferences, and such labeling patterns are referred to as tendency. In multi-annotator scenarios, we introduce a novel task called Multi-annotator Tendency Learning (MATL), which aims to capture each annotator tendency. Unlike traditional tasks that prioritize consensus-oriented learning, which averages out annotator differences and leads to tendency information loss, MATL emphasizes learning each annotator tendency, better preserves tendency information. To this end, we propose an efficient baseline method, Query-based Multi-annotator Tendency Learning (QuMATL), which uses lightweight query to represent each annotator for tendency modeling. It saves the costs of building separate conventional models for each annotator, leverages shared learnable queries to capture inter-annotator correlations as an additional hidden supervisory signal to enhance modeling performance. Meanwhile, we provide a new metric, Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC), to evaluate how effectively models preserve annotators tendency information. Additionally, we contribute two large-scale datasets, STREET and AMER, providing averages of 4300 and 3118 per-annotator labels, respectively. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our QuMATL.",

      "abstract": "Partially deepfake audio localization is important in audio forensics. However, existing localization models for partially deepfake audio face two major challenges: distribution shifts between training and testing data as well as insufficient utilization of information from both manipulated regions and boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose to use Adversarial training and Gradient Optimization (AGO) to improve partially fake audio localization. Specifically, we apply a gradient reversal layer to reduce the dependence on domain-specific features, enhancing the model’s generalization ability. Additionally, we introduce an alternating update strategy to learn information from both manipulated regions and boundaries, while orthogonal gradient updates minimize conflicts between the two tasks. We evaluated AGO on both the ADD2023 track 2 and PartialSpoof datasets. We achieved a 22.82% relative improvement over the first-ranked method of the ADD2023 track 2. We also achieved state-of-the-art results on the PartialSpoof dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Little-dingding/ATGO.",

However, challenges such as difficulties in data acquisition and imbalance annotations have made it difficult for current methods to meet the demands of practical applications. Therefore, we have organized two tracks focusing on the key themes of semi-supervised learning and class imbalance. Additionally, we have prepared data in two different languages (English and Mandarin) for each track, treating each language as a sub-track, to encourage participants to explore solutions in more diverse linguistic environments.

      "abstract": "The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advances multimodal emotion recognition (MER) to the next level, from naive discriminative tasks to complex emotion understanding with advanced video understanding abilities and natural language description. However, the current community suffers from a lack of large-scale datasets with intensive, descriptive emotion annotations, as well as a multimodal-centric framework to maximize the potential of MLLMs for emotion understanding. To address this, we establish a new benchmark for MLLM-based emotion understanding with a novel dataset (MER-Caption) and a new model (AffectGPT). Utilizing our model-based crowd-sourcing data collection strategy, we construct the largest descriptive emotion dataset to date (by far), featuring over 2K fine-grained emotion categories across 115K samples. We also introduce the AffectGPT model, designed with pre-fusion operations to enhance multimodal integration. Finally, we present MER-UniBench, a unified benchmark with evaluation metrics tailored for typical MER tasks and the free-form, natural language output style of MLLMs. Extensive experimental results show AffectGPT's robust performance across various MER tasks. We have released both the code and the dataset to advance research and development in emotion understanding: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/AffectGPT.",

      "abstract": "The IERP 2024 Challenge is part of the ISCSLP 2024 Competition and Challenge track, aiming to explore the application of personality characteristics in emotion recognition. Existing emotion recognition technologies primarily focus on improving the accuracy of discrete and dimensional emotions, limiting their application scope. However, emotion is closely related to personality, and individuals with different personality traits exhibit distinct emotional expressions. Therefore, integrating personality characteristics into emotion recognition systems can enhance their accuracy and adaptability, holding significant research value. The IERP 2024 Challenge provides a large-scale emotional dataset with personality trait labels and includes two tracks: Track 1: Emotion Recognition Based on Audio and Text Modality: Utilize the provided speech features to recognize the scores of eight emotions ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 represents none and 5 represents the highest degree. Track 2: Multimodal Emotion Recognition: Utilize speech features, text features, and video to design an effective emotion classification method. The emotion types, score ranges, and speech features are the same as Track 1, with the added challenge of incorporating visual information. The challenge offers a platform for researchers and developers to showcase their skills, advance emotion recognition technology, and promote its application in diverse fields.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition is an important research topic in artificial intelligence. However, due to problems such as complex environments and inaccurate annotations, current systems are hard to meet the demands of practical applications. Therefore, we organize the MER series of competitions to promote the development of this field. Last year, we launched MER2023, focusing on three interesting topics: multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning. In this year's MER2024, besides expanding the dataset size, we further introduce a new track around open-vocabulary emotion recognition. The main purpose of this track is that existing datasets usually fix the label space and use majority voting to enhance the annotator consistency. However, this process may lead to inaccurate annotations, such as ignoring non-majority or non-candidate labels. In this track, we encourage participants to generate any number of labels in any category, aiming to describe emotional states as accurately as possible. Our baseline code relies on MERTools and is available at: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/MERTools/tree/master/MER2024.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) in practical scenarios is significantly challenged by the presence of missing or incomplete data across different modalities. To overcome these challenges, researchers have aimed to simulate incomplete conditions during the training phase to enhance the system's overall robustness. Traditional methods have often involved discarding data or substituting data segments with zero vectors to approximate these incompletenesses. However, such approaches neither accurately represent real-world conditions nor adequately address the issue of noisy data availability. For instance, a blurry image cannot be simply replaced with zero vectors, while still retaining information. To tackle this issue and develop a more precise MER system, we introduce a novel noise-robust MER model that effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data. This approach includes two pivotal components: firstly, a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the data to emulate various realistic incomplete situations. Secondly, a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based module is employed to reconstruct these robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy inputs. Notably, the introduction of the noise scheduler enables the exploration of an entirely new type of incomplete data condition, which is impossible with existing methods. Extensive experimental evaluations on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate the effectiveness of the noise scheduler and the excellent performance of our proposed model. Our project is publicly available on https://github.com/WooyoohL/Noise-robust_MER.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our unique method for the MuSe 2024 Perception sub-challenge. In the Perception sub-challenge, 21 labeled social perceptions data are given, 16 social perceptions are required to be predicted. Joint learning is crucial for our approach, as it allows for the comprehensive integration of multiple perceptions to enhance prediction accuracy. We fully utilize the LMU-ELP dataset, integrating 16 perceptions and their PCC distribution, along with an additional 5 perceptions that are not required for prediction, for joint prediction. We use visual, audio, and text modality features as the basic multimodal input into an MLP encoder, and employ 21 encoders to represent the 21 perceptions provided in the LMU-ELP dataset. All embeddings are stacked and multiplied with a learnable PCC matrix, initialized as the 21 perceptions PCC matrix. This is followed by a attention block for further joint learning. Our method achieves a mean Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.4098 and ranks in the Top 1 in this challenges.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal humor detection has become an active research area in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper presents the solution for the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge of cross-cultural humor detection. The goal of the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge is to predict whether humor exists in a given dataset, which includes data from various modalities such as text, audio, and video. The training data consists of German recordings and their transcriptions, while the test data is in English. This cross-cultural testing introduces new challenges, distinguishing it from ordinary multimodal humor detection tasks. To address this issue, we propose a method called Dual-Phase Processing (DPP). The proposed method first preprocesses the text data using a large language model to extract more effective features for humor detection from the raw data. It also partially addresses cross-cultural differences through bilingual annotation. Finally, by applying composite temporal smoothing to the results after decision-level fusion of the three modalities, the accuracy of humor prediction is greatly improved. The experimental results on the official test set demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our model achieves an impressive AUC score of 0.9366 on the test set, far surpassing the baseline and securing the first-place ranking.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) is a critical research area that seeks to decode human emotions from diverse data modalities. However, existing machine learning methods predominantly rely on predefined emotion taxonomies, which fail to capture the inherent complexity, subtlety, and multi-appraisal nature of human emotional experiences, as demonstrated by studies in psychology and cognitive science. To overcome this limitation, we advocate for introducing the concept of open vocabulary into MER. This paradigm shift aims to enable models to predict emotions beyond a fixed label space, accommodating a flexible set of categories to better reflect the nuanced spectrum of human emotions. To achieve this, we propose a novel paradigm: Open-Vocabulary MER (OV-MER), which enables emotion prediction without being confined to predefined spaces. However, constructing a dataset that encompasses the full range of emotions for OV-MER is practically infeasible; hence, we present a comprehensive solution including a newly curated database, novel evaluation metrics, and a preliminary benchmark. By advancing MER from basic emotions to more nuanced and diverse emotional states, we hope this work can inspire the next generation of MER, enhancing its generalizability and applicability in real-world scenarios.

      "abstract": "Video-based facial affect analysis has recently attracted increasing attention owing to its critical role in human-computer interaction. Previous studies mainly focus on developing various deep learning architectures and training them in a fully supervised manner. Although significant progress has been achieved by these supervised methods, the longstanding lack of large-scale high-quality labeled data severely hinders their further improvements. Motivated by the recent success of self-supervised learning in computer vision, this paper introduces a self-supervised approach, termed Self-supervised Video Facial Affect Perceiver (SVFAP), to address the dilemma faced by supervised methods. Specifically, SVFAP leverages masked facial video autoencoding to perform self-supervised pre-training on massive unlabeled facial videos. Considering that large spatiotemporal redundancy exists in facial videos, we propose a novel temporal pyramid and spatial bottleneck Transformer as the encoder of SVFAP, which not only largely reduces computational costs but also achieves excellent performance. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning three downstream tasks, including dynamic facial expression recognition, dimensional emotion recognition, and personality recognition. Comprehensive results demonstrate that SVFAP can learn powerful affect-related representations via large-scale self-supervised pre-training and it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.",

      "abstract": "Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) is an emerging task that aims to achieve reliable and accurate emotion recognition. However, due to the high annotation cost, the existing dataset (denoted as EMER-Fine) is small, making it difficult to perform supervised training. To reduce the annotation cost and expand the dataset size, this paper reviews the previous dataset construction process. Then, we simplify the annotation pipeline, avoid manual checks, and replace the closed-source models with open-source models. Finally, we build \\textbf{EMER-Coarse}, a coarsely-labeled dataset containing large-scale samples. Besides the dataset, we propose a two-stage training framework \\textbf{AffectGPT}. The first stage exploits EMER-Coarse to learn a coarse mapping between multimodal inputs and emotion-related descriptions; the second stage uses EMER-Fine to better align with manually-checked results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the challenging EMER task. To facilitate further research, we will make the code and dataset available at: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/AffectGPT.",

      "abstract": "Emotion and Intent Joint Understanding in Multimodal Conversation (MC-EIU) aims to decode the semantic information manifested in a multimodal conversational history, while inferring the emotions and intents simultaneously for the current utterance. MC-EIU is enabling technology for many human-computer interfaces. However, there is a lack of available datasets in terms of annotation, modality, language diversity, and accessibility. In this work, we propose an MC-EIU dataset, which features 7 emotion categories, 9 intent categories, 3 modalities, i.e., textual, acoustic, and visual content, and two languages, i.e., English and Mandarin. Furthermore, it is completely open-source for free access. To our knowledge, MC-EIU is the first comprehensive and rich emotion and intent joint understanding dataset for multimodal conversation. Together with the release of the dataset, we also develop an Emotion and Intent Interaction (EI$^2$) network as a reference system by modeling the deep correlation between emotion and intent in the multimodal conversation. With comparative experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EI$^2$ method on the MC-EIU dataset. The dataset and codes will be made available at: https://github.com/MC-EIU/MC-EIU.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aims to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of percutaneous antegrade and retrograde screws in treating superior pubic rami fractures in zone II, employing finite element analysis. It provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of the superior rami of pubis zone II fracture. Methods The software of Mimics and 3-Matic were utilized for reconstructing a fracture model of the superior pubic rami in zone II. Percutaneous screw implantation was simulated for treatment. Material properties were assigned using Mimics, and Ansys software was employed to simulate forces on the S1 vertebral endplate under a 500 N load in a standing posture. Mechanical stability was assessed by comparing these simulations. Results (1) Displacement and stress variations in the pubic bone and screws were consistent across the model and on the fracture site, whether the fracture was in zone I or zone II. However, in zone III, the displacement and stress experienced by the screws were markedly higher than those in zones I and II. (2) When employing an antegrade screw to simulate treatment of a superior pubic rami fracture in zone II, the maximum displacement and stress recorded were 0.88 mm and 15.53 MPa, respectively. Conversely, the use of a retrograde screw for treating a superior pubic rami fracture yielded a maximum displacement of 0.59 mm and stress of 5.51 MPa. Conclusion The biomechanical analysis suggests that for zone II superior pubic rami fractures, where the fracture line is no more than 70 mm from the insertion point (encompassing zones I and II fractures), the use of retrograde screw implantation is preferable.",

With the recent surge in the number of large pre-trained models, combining both multimodal fusion methods and pre-trained model features can achieve outstanding performance in many multimodal tasks. In this paper, we present our approach, which leverages both advantages for addressing the task of Expression (Expr) Recognition and Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation. We evaluate the Aff-Wild2 database using pre-trained models, then extract the final hidden layers of the models as features. Following preprocessing and interpolation or convolution to align the extracted features, different models are employed for modal fusion. Our code is available at GitHub - FulgenceWen/ABAW6th.",

      "abstract": "Recently, GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V) has demonstrated remarkable visual capabilities across various tasks, but its performance in emotion recognition has not been fully evaluated. To bridge this gap, we present the quantitative evaluation results of GPT-4V on 21 benchmark datasets covering 6 tasks: visual sentiment analysis, tweet sentiment analysis, micro-expression recognition, facial emotion recognition, dynamic facial emotion recognition, and multimodal emotion recognition. This paper collectively refers to these tasks as \"Generalized Emotion Recognition (GER)\". Through experimental analysis, we observe that GPT-4V exhibits strong visual understanding capabilities in GER tasks. Meanwhile, GPT-4V shows the ability to integrate multimodal clues and exploit temporal information, which is also critical for emotion recognition. However, it's worth noting that GPT-4V is primarily designed for general domains and cannot recognize micro-expressions that require specialized knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first quantitative assessment of GPT-4V for GER tasks. We have open-sourced the code and encourage subsequent researchers to broaden the evaluation scope by including more tasks and datasets. Our code and evaluation results are available at: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/gpt4v-emotion.",

      "abstract": "Partial-label learning (PLL) is an important branch of weakly supervised learning where the single ground truth resides in a set of candidate labels, while the research rarely considers the label imbalance. A recent study for imbalanced PLL propose that the combinatorial challenge of partial-label learning and long-tail learning lies in matching between a decent marginal prior distribution with drawing the pseudo labels. However, even if the pseudo label matches the prior distribution, the tail classes will still be difficult to learn because the total weight of tail classes is too small. Therefore, we propose a pseudo-label regularization technique specially designed for imbalanced PLL. By punishing the pseudo labels of head classes, our method implements state-of-art under the standardized benchmarks compared to the previous PLL methods.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to understand the way that humans express their emotions by exploring complementary information across modalities. However, it is hard to guarantee that full-modality data is always available in real-world scenarios. To deal with missing modalities, researchers focused on meaningful joint multimodal representation learning during cross-modal missing modality imagination. However, the cross-modal imagination mechanism is highly susceptible to errors due to the \"modality gap\" issue, which affects the imagination accuracy, thus, the final recognition performance. To this end, we introduce the concept of a modality-invariant feature into the missing modality imagination network, which contains two key modules: 1) a novel contrastive learning-based module to extract modality-invariant features under full modalities and 2) a robust imagination module based on imagined invariant features to reconstruct missing information under missing conditions. Finally, we incorporate imagined and available modalities for emotion recognition. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art strategies. Compared with our previous work, our extended version is more effective on multimodal emotion recognition with missing modalities.",

      "abstract": "Deception detection has attracted increasing attention due to its importance in real-world scenarios. Its main goal is to detect deceptive behaviors from multimodal clues such as gestures, facial expressions, prosody, etc. However, these bases are usually subjective and related to personal habits. Therefore, we extend deception detection to deception reasoning, further providing objective evidence to support subjective judgment. Specifically, we provide potential lies and basic facts and then analyze why this sentence may be a lie by combining factual inconsistencies and intent behind them. Compared with deception detection, this task is more applicable to real-world scenarios. For example, in interrogation, the police should judge whether a person is lying based on solid evidence. This paper presents our initial attempts at this task, including constructing a dataset and defining evaluation metrics. Meanwhile, this task can serve as a benchmark for evaluating the complex reasoning capability of large language models. Our code and data are provided in the supplementary material.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience in human-computer interaction. Over the past few decades, researchers have proposed a series of algorithms and achieved impressive progress. Although each method shows its superior performance, different methods lack a fair comparison due to inconsistencies in feature extractors, evaluation manners, and experimental settings. These inconsistencies severely hinder the development of this field. Therefore, we build MERBench, a unified evaluation benchmark for multimodal emotion recognition. We aim to reveal the contribution of some important techniques employed in previous works, such as feature selection, multimodal fusion, robustness analysis, fine-tuning, pre-training, etc. We hope this benchmark can provide clear and comprehensive guidance for follow-up researchers. Based on the evaluation results of MERBench, we further point out some promising research directions. Additionally, we introduce a new emotion dataset MER2023, focusing on the Chinese language environment. This dataset can serve as a benchmark dataset for research on multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning. We encourage the follow-up researchers to evaluate their algorithms under the same experimental setup as MERBench for fair comparisons. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/MERTools.",

      "abstract": "There remain two critical challenges that hinder the development of ERC. Firstly, there is a lack of exploration into mining deeper insights from the data itself for conversational emotion tasks. Secondly, the systems exhibit vulnerability to random modality feature missing, which is a common occurrence in realistic settings. Focusing on these two key challenges, we propose a novel framework for incomplete multimodal learning in ERC, called \"Inverted Teacher-studEnt seArCH Network (ITEACH-Net).\" ITEACH-Net comprises two novel components: the Emotion Context Changing Encoder (ECCE) and the Inverted Teacher-Student (ITS) framework. Specifically, leveraging the tendency for emotional states to exhibit local stability within conversational contexts, ECCE captures these patterns and further perceives their evolution over time. Recognizing the varying challenges of handling incomplete versus complete data, ITS employs a teacher-student framework to decouple the respective computations. Subsequently, through Neural Architecture Search, the student model develops enhanced computational capabilities for handling incomplete data compared to the teacher model. During testing, we design a novel evaluation method, testing the model's performance under different missing rate conditions without altering the model weights. We conduct experiments on three benchmark ERC datasets, and the results demonstrate that our ITEACH-Net outperforms existing methods in incomplete multimodal ERC. We believe ITEACH-Net can inspire relevant research on the intrinsic nature of emotions within conversation scenarios and pave a more robust route for incomplete learning techniques. Codes will be made available.",

      "abstract": "The first Multimodal Emotion Recognition Challenge (MER 2023)1 was successfully held at ACM Multimedia. The challenge focuses on system robustness and consists of three distinct tracks: (1) MER-MULTI, where participants are required to recognize both discrete and dimensional emotions; (2) MER-NOISE, in which noise is added to test videos for modality robustness evaluation; (3) MER-SEMI, which provides a large amount of unlabeled samples for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we introduce the motivation behind this challenge, describe the benchmark dataset, and provide some statistics about participants. To continue using this dataset after MER 2023, please sign a new End User License Agreement2 and send it to our official email address3. We believe this high-quality dataset can become a new benchmark in multimodal emotion recognition, especially for the Chinese research community.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is essential to the development of intelligent and empathetic machines. Prior efforts in this field mainly fall into supervised learning paradigm, which is severely restricted by the limited labeled data in existing datasets. Inspired by recent unprecedented success of masked autoencoders (e.g., VideoMAE), this paper proposes MAE-DFER, a novel self-supervised method which leverages large-scale self-supervised pre-training on abundant unlabeled data to largely advance the development of DFER. Since the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) employed in VideoMAE requires substantial computation during fine-tuning, MAE-DFER develops an efficient local-global interaction Transformer (LGI-Former) as the encoder. Moreover, in addition to the standalone appearance content reconstruction in VideoMAE, MAE-DFER also introduces explicit temporal facial motion modeling to encourage LGI-Former to excavate both static appearance and dynamic motion information. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that MAE-DFER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods by significant margins (e.g., +6.30% UAR on DFEW and +8.34% UAR on MAFW), verifying that it can learn powerful dynamic facial representations via large-scale self-supervised pre-training. Besides, it has comparable or even better performance than VideoMAE, while largely reducing the computational cost (about 38% FLOPs). We believe MAE-DFER has paved a new way for the advancement of DFER and can inspire more relevant research in this field and even other related tasks. Codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/sunlicai/MAE-DFER.",

      "abstract": "The task of interval localization of macro- and micro-expression in long videos has a wide range of applications in the field of human-computer interaction. Compared with macro-expression, micro-expression has shorter duration, lower intensity, and smaller number of samples, which make them more difficult to spot accurately in long videos. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained model combined with the optical flow method to improve the accuracy and robustness of macro- and micro-expression spotting. Firstly, self-supervised pre-training is performed on rich unlabeled data based on VideoMAE. Then, multiple models are trained on the datasets SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)³ for macro- and micro-expression with different fine-grains. Finally, different lengths of slices are generated based on the models with different fine-grains, and the optimal matching method through the combination of model fine-grainedness and slice lengths is explored. At the same time, macro- and micro-expression generating regions were spotted using the optical flow method, fused with the model outputs to supplement the spatio-temporal information not captured by the model and to exclude the interference of non-interested regions. We evaluated the performance of our method on the MEGC2023 testset (consisting of 10 long videos from SAMM and 20 long videos from CAS(ME)3) and won first place in the MEGC2023 Challenge. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our solution to the Personalisation subchallenge in MuSe 2023. It aims to predict physio-arousal and valence for different individuals using multimodal inputs (such as audio, video, text, and physiological signals). During the competition, we observe notable performance variations among individuals with identical feature sets and model architectures, prompting us to propose an individual-specific framework. Additionally, fusion methods lead to severe overfitting when predicting physio-arousal. To enhance the generalization capability, we integrate ensemble learning, pseudo-label training, and information delay in the model design. Finally, our proposed solution achieves 0.8275 for physioarousal and 0.8876 for valence on the test data, significantly surpassing the baseline system (0.7450 for physio-arousal and 0.7827 for valence).",

      "abstract": "Humor detection has emerged as an active research area within the field of artificial intelligence. Over the past few decades, it has made remarkable progress with the development of deep learning. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at enhancing the model's understanding of humorous expressions. Specifically, we consider the impact of correspondence between labels and features. In order to achieve more effective models with limited training samples, we employ a widely utilized semi-supervised learning technique called pseudo labeling. Furthermore, we use the post-smoothing strategy to eliminate abnormally high predictions. At the same time, in order to alleviate the over-fitting phenomenon of the model on the validation set, we created 10 different random subsets of the training and then aggregating their prediction. To verify the effectiveness of our strategy, we evaluate its performance on the Cross-Cultural Humour sub-challenge at MuSe 2023. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an AUC score of 0.9112, surpassing the performance of baseline models by a substantial margin.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition is an important research topic in artificial intelligence, whose main goal is to integrate multimodal clues to identify human emotional states. Current works generally assume accurate labels for benchmark datasets and focus on developing more effective architectures. However, emotion annotation relies on subjective judgment. To obtain more reliable labels, existing datasets usually restrict the label space to some basic categories, then hire plenty of annotators and use majority voting to select the most likely label. However, this process may result in some correct but non-candidate or non-majority labels being ignored. To ensure reliability without ignoring subtle emotions, we propose a new task called ``Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER)''. Unlike traditional emotion recognition, EMER takes a step further by providing explanations for these predictions. Through this task, we can extract relatively reliable labels since each label has a certain basis. Meanwhile, we borrow large language models (LLMs) to disambiguate unimodal clues and generate more complete multimodal explanations. From them, we can extract richer emotions in an open-vocabulary manner. This paper presents our initial attempt at this task, including introducing a new dataset, establishing baselines, and defining evaluation metrics. In addition, EMER can serve as a benchmark task to evaluate the audio-video-text understanding performance of multimodal LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Audio deepfake detection is an emerging topic in the artificial intelligence community. The second Audio Deepfake Detection Challenge (ADD 2023) aims to spur researchers around the world to build new innovative technologies that can further accelerate and foster research on detecting and analyzing deepfake speech utterances. Different from previous challenges (e.g. ADD 2022), ADD 2023 focuses on surpassing the constraints of binary real/fake classification, and actually localizing the manipulated intervals in a partially fake speech as well as pinpointing the source responsible for generating any fake audio. Furthermore, ADD 2023 includes more rounds of evaluation for the fake audio game sub-challenge. The ADD 2023 challenge includes three subchallenges: audio fake game (FG), manipulation region location (RL) and deepfake algorithm recognition (AR). This paper describes the datasets, evaluation metrics, and protocols. Some findings are also reported in audio deepfake detection tasks.",

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of user-generated online videos, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has attracted increasing attention recently. Despite significant progress, there are still two major challenges on the way towards robust MSA: 1) inefficiency when modeling cross-modal interactions in unaligned multimodal data; and 2) vulnerability to random modality feature missing which typically occurs in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose a generic and unified framework to address them, named Efficient Multimodal Transformer with Dual-Level Feature Restoration (EMT-DLFR). Concretely, EMT employs utterance-level representations from each modality as the global multimodal context to interact with local unimodal features and mutually promote each other. It not only avoids the quadratic scaling cost of previous local-local cross-modal interaction methods but also leads to better performance. To improve model robustness in the incomplete modality setting, on the one hand, DLFR performs low-level feature reconstruction to implicitly encourage the model to learn semantic information from incomplete data. On the other hand, it innovatively regards complete and incomplete data as two different views of one sample and utilizes siamese representation learning to explicitly attract their high-level representations. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.",

      "abstract": "Background: 1, 8-naphthimide is a novel tumor inhibitor targeting nuclear DNA, which makes it applicable to the design and development of anti-osteosarcoma drugs. Objective: The aim of this study is to establish a satisfactory model based on 1, 8-naphthimide derivatives that makes reliable prediction as DNA-targeted chemotherapy agents for osteosarcoma. Methods: All compounds are constructed using ChemDraw software and subsequently optimized using Sybyl software. COMSIA method is used to construct QSAR model with the optimized compound in Sybyl software package. A series of new 1, 8-naphthalimide derivatives are designed and their IC50 values are predicted using the QSAR model. Finally, the newly designed compounds are screened according to IC50 values, and molecular docking experiments are conducted on the top ten compounds of IC50. Results: The COMSIA model shows that q2 is 0.529 and the optimum number of components is 6. The model has a high r2 value of 0.993 and a low SEE of 0.033, with the F value and the r2 predicted to be 495.841 and 0.996 respectively. The statistical results and verification results of the model are satisfactory. In addition, analyzing the contour maps is conducive to finding the structural requirements. Conclusion: The results of this study can provide guidance for medical chemists and other related workers to develop targeted chemotherapy drugs for osteosarcoma",

      "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to building reliable machine learning systems in the open world. Researchers have proposed various strategies to reduce model overconfidence on OOD data. Among them, ReAct is a typical and effective technique to deal with model overconfidence, which truncates high activations to increase the gap between in-distribution and OOD. Despite its promising results, is this technique the best choice for widening the gap? To answer this question, we leverage the variational method to find the optimal operation and verify the necessity of suppressing abnormally low and high activations and amplifying intermediate activations in OOD detection, rather than focusing only on high activations like ReAct. This motivates us to propose a novel technique called ``Variational Rectified Activation (VRA)'', which simulates these suppression and amplification operations using piecewise functions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing post-hoc strategies. Meanwhile, VRA is compatible with different scoring functions and network architectures. \\textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{Our code can be found in Supplementary Material}.",

      "abstract": "Noisy partial label learning (noisy PLL) is an important branch of weakly supervised learning. Unlike PLL where the ground-truth label must conceal in the candidate label set, noisy PLL relaxes this constraint and allows the ground-truth label may not be in the candidate label set. To address this challenging problem, most of the existing works attempt to detect noisy samples and estimate the ground-truth label for each noisy sample. However, detection errors are unavoidable. These errors can accumulate during training and continuously affect model optimization. To this end, we propose a novel framework for noisy PLL with theoretical guarantees, called ``Adjusting Label Importance Mechanism (ALIM)''. It aims to reduce the negative impact of detection errors by trading off the initial candidate set and model outputs. ALIM is a plug-in strategy that can be integrated with existing PLL approaches. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on noisy PLL. \\textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{Our code can be found in Supplementary Material}.",

      "abstract": "Conversations have become a critical data format on social media platforms. Understanding conversation from emotion, content and other aspects also attracts increasing attention from researchers due to its widespread application in human-computer interaction. In real-world environments, we often encounter the problem of incomplete modalities, which has become a core issue of conversation understanding. To address this problem, researchers propose various methods. However, existing approaches are mainly designed for individual utterances rather than conversational data, which cannot fully exploit temporal and speaker information in conversations. To this end, we propose a novel framework for incomplete multimodal learning in conversations, called \"Graph Complete Network (GCNet),\" filling the gap of existing works. Our GCNet contains two well-designed graph neural network-based modules, \"Speaker GNN\" and \"Temporal GNN,\" to capture temporal and speaker dependencies. To make full use of complete and incomplete data, we jointly optimize classification and reconstruction tasks in an end-to-end manner. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on three benchmark conversational datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our GCNet is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches in incomplete multimodal learning.",

      "abstract": "The evidential reasoning (ER) rule, with its strict probabilistic reasoning and superior uncertainty handling ability, has been widely used in the evaluation, diagnosis, and decision-making. Recently, a modeling approach based on the ER rule that combines the evidence constituted by a single attribute (SA_ER) has gradually attracted scholars' attention due to its good scalability and flexibility. However, in the SA_ER, the frame of discernment (FoD) is composed of a series of singleton propositions and the universal set of these propositions. Since the SA_ER has a special form of evidence structure, its reflection on the system output is incomplete. The existing FoD is unable to quantify this incompleteness, which greatly limits the development of SA_ER. In this article, an improved SA_ER approach that extends the FoD to the power set (PSA_ER) is proposed. Meanwhile, combined with the physical meaning of the model parameters, the expressions of evidence weight and reliability are deduced, respectively. Then, an intelligent optimization algorithm is used to optimize partial parameters to enhance the performance of PSA_ER. Further, the basic properties of PSA_ER are analyzed in detail from the parameter level to promote its engineering application. Finally, an engineering example is intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders and can lead to suicide in extreme cases. It is crucial to develop and design an automatic depression detection(ADD) model that is objective, effective, and robust. Many works have been done to develop automatic depression detection systems using speech data due to its easy accessibility and privacy. Although most current methods use RNN, it is difficult to capture the long-term dependence of depressed audio due to the gradient explosion/vanish. In this paper, a novel model combining Transformer Encoder and CNN is proposed to address this problem. Experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset show that the performance of the algorithm has improved considerably, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.48 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.37.",

      "abstract": "On-road object detection is an important part of driverless technology. The on-road object detection task requires both detection speed and accuracy. We propose an improved RepVGG-based anchor-free real-time object detection algorithm to meet these requirements. The RepVggmodule is improved by a reparameterization method, and an adaptive Fusion-Distribution Feature Pyramid Network(FDFPN) structure is proposed, based on which an anchor-free object detection head with fewer hyperparameters is constructed to balance accuracy and speed. Experiments on KITTI dataset show that the accuracy of this method can reach 80.01%, and the inference latency is only 5.9ms in deployment mode.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the solution to the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge in the MuSe 2022 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge. The task of MuSe-Stress is to predict a time-continuous value (i.e., physiological arousal and valence) based on multimodal data of audio, visual, text, and physiological signals. In this competition, we find that multimodal fusion has good performance for physiological arousal on the validation set, but poor prediction performance on the test set. We believe that problem may be due to the over-fitting caused by the model's over-reliance on some specific modal features. To deal with the above problem, we propose Multimodal Temporal Attention (MMTA), which considers the temporal effects of all modalities on each unimodal branch, realizing the interaction between unimodal branches and adaptive inter-modal balance. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of physiological arousal and valence are 0.6818 with MMTA and 0.6841 with early fusion, respectively, both ranking Top 1, outperforming the baseline system by a large margin (i.e., 0.4761 and 0.4931) on the test set.",

      "abstract": "Automatically predicting and understanding human emotional reactions have wide applications in human-computer interaction. In this paper, we present our solutions to the MuSe-Reaction sub-challenge in MuSe 2022. The task of this sub-challenge is to predict the intensity of 7 emotional expressions from human reactions to a wide range of emotionally evocative stimuli. Specifically, we design an end-to-end model, which is composed of a Spatio-Temporal Transformer for dynamic facial representation learning and a multi-label graph convolutional network for emotion dependency modeling.We also explore the effects of a temporal model with a variety of features from acoustic and visual modalities. Our proposed method achieves mean Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.3375 on the test set of MuSe-Reaction, which outperforms the baseline system(i.e., 0.2801) by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "Medical Relation Extraction (MRE) task aims to extract relations between entities in medical texts. Traditional relation extraction methods achieve impressive success by exploring the syntactic information, e.g., dependency tree. However, the quality of the 1-best dependency tree for medical texts produced by an out-of-domain parser is relatively limited so that the performance of medical relation extraction method may degenerate. To this end, we propose a method to jointly model semantic and syntactic information from medical texts based on causal explanation theory. We generate dependency forests consisting of the semantic-embedded 1-best dependency tree. Then, a task-specific causal explainer is adopted to prune the dependency forests, which are further fed into a designed graph convolutional network to learn the corresponding representation for downstream task. Empirically, the various comparisons on benchmark medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

      "abstract": "Affibodies targeting intracellular proteins have a great potential to function as ideal therapeutic agents. However, little is known about how the affibodies enter target cells to interact with intracellular target proteins. We have previously developed the HPV16E7 affibody (ZHPV16E7384) for HPV16 positive cervical cancer treatment. Here, we explored the underlying mechanisms of ZHPV16E7384 and found that ZHPV16E7384 significantly inhibited the proliferation of target cells and induced a G1/S phase cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, ZHPV16E7384 treatment resulted in the upregulation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and downregulation of phosphorylated Rb (pRb), E2F1, cyclin D1, and CDK4 in the target cells. Moreover, treatment with dynamin or the caveolin-1 inhibitor not only significantly suppressed the internalization of ZHPV16E7384 into target cells but also reversed the regulation of cell cycle factors by ZHPV16E7384. Overall, these results indicate that ZHPV16E7384 was likely internalized specifically into target cells through dynamin- and caveolin-1 mediated endocytosis. ZHPV16E7384 induced the cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase at least partially by interrupting HPV16E7 binding to and degrading Rb, subsequently leading to the downregulation of E2F1, cyclin D1, CDK4, and pRb, which ultimately inhibited target cell proliferation. These findings provide a rationale of using ZHPV16E7384 to conduct a clinical trial for target therapy in cervical cancer.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is important for enhancing user experience in human-computer interaction. Unlike vanilla emotion recognition in individual utterances, ERC aims to classify constituent utterances in a dialog into corresponding emotion labels, which makes contextual information crucial. In addition to contextual information, personality traits also affect emotional perception based on psychological findings. Although researchers have proposed several approaches and achieved promising results on ERC, current works in this domain rarely incorporate contextual information and personality influence. To this end, we propose a novel framework to integrate these factors seamlessly, called \"Personality-enhanced Iterative Refinement Network (PIRNet).\" Specifically, PIRNet is a multistage iterative method. To capture personality influence, PIRNet leverages personality traits to mimic emotional transitions and generates personality-enhanced results. Then we exploit sequence models to capture contextual information in conversations. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets for ERC, that is, IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI. Experimental results demonstrate that our PIRNet succeeds over currently advanced approaches to emotion recognition.",

The task of ABAW is to predict frame-level emotion descriptors from videos: discrete emotional state; valence and arousal; and action units. Although researchers have proposed several approaches and achieved promising results in ABAW, current works in this task rarely consider interactions between different emotion descriptors. To this end, we propose a novel end to end architecture to achieve full integration of different types of information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.",

      "abstract": "Background: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a serious neurosurgical emergency with extremely high morbidity and mortality rates. Resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenolic phytoalexin, is broadly presented in a wide variety of plants. Previous research had reasonably revealed its neuroprotective effects on experimental SAH animal models to some extent. But the results were more controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of RES in improving outcomes in SAH animal models. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to incorporate experimental control studies on the efficacy of RES on SAH models into our research. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to compare the brain water content (BWC) and neurological score (NS) between the treatment and control groups. Results: Overall, 16 articles published from 2014 to 2022 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of BWC showed a significant difference in favor of RES treatment (SMD: −1.026; 95% CI: −1.380, −0.672; p = 0.000) with significant heterogeneity (Q = 84.97; I 2 = 60.0%; p = 0.000). Further stratified analysis was performed for methodological differences, especially dosage, time of treatments, and time-point of outcome assessment. The meta-analysis of NS showed a significant difference in favor of RES treatment (SMD: 1.342; 95% CI: 1.089, 1.595; p = 0.000) with low heterogeneity (Q = 25.58; I 2 = 17.9%; p = 0.223). Conclusion: Generally, RES treatment showed an improvement in both pathological and behavioral outcomes in SAH animal models. The results of this study may provide a reference for preclinical and clinical studies in the future to some extent, with great significance for human health.",

      "abstract": "Although multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient is a classic deep reinforcement learning algorithm in multi-agent systems. It also has critical problems such as poor training stability and low policy robustness, which significantly limit the capability and application of the algorithm. So this article proposes an improved algorithm called friend-or-foe multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient for solving the above problems. The main innovations are as follows: (1) inspired by the concept of friend-or-foe game theory, we modified the framework of the original multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient by using two identical training networks with agents’ optimal and worst actions input, which improves the robustness of training policies, and (2) we propose an action perturbation technique based on gradient-descent to expand the selection range of actions, thereby improving training stability of our proposing algorithm. Finally, we conducted multiple sets of comparative experiments between our friend-or-foe multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient and original one in four authoritative mixed cooperative–competitive scenarios. The results show that our improving algorithm can simultaneously improve the training stability and the robustness of agents’ generating policies in different complicated environments.",

      "abstract": "Audio deepfake detection is an emerging topic, which was included in the ASVspoof 2021. However, the recent shared tasks have not covered many real-life and challenging scenarios. The first Audio Deep synthesis Detection challenge (ADD) was motivated to fill in the gap. The ADD 2022 includes three tracks: low-quality fake audio detection (LF), partially fake audio detection (PF) and audio fake game (FG). The LF track focuses on dealing with bona fide and fully fake utterances with various real-world noises etc. The PF track aims to distinguish the partially fake audio from the real. The FG track is a rivalry game, which includes two tasks: an audio generation task and an audio fake detection task. In this paper, we describe the datasets, evaluation metrics, and protocols. We also report major findings that reflect the recent advances in audio deepfake detection tasks.",

      "abstract": "Conversational emotion recognition is a crucial research topic in human-computer interactions. Due to the heavy annotation cost and inevitable label ambiguity, collecting large amounts of labeled data is challenging and expensive, which restricts the performance of current fully-supervised methods in this domain. To address this problem, researchers attempt to distill knowledge from unlabeled data via semi-supervised learning. However, most of these semi-supervised methods ignore multimodal interactive information, although recent works have proven that such interactive information is essential for emotion recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework to seamlessly integrate semi-supervised learning with multimodal interactions, called \"Semi-supervised Multi-modal Interaction Network (SMIN)\". SMIN contains two well-designed semi-supervised modules, \"Intra-modal Interactive Module (IIM)\" and \"Cross-modal Interactive Module (CIM)\" to learn intra- and cross-modal interactions. These two modules leverage additional unlabeled data to extract emotion-salient representations. To capture additional contextual information, we utilize the hierarchical recurrent networks followed with the hybrid fusion strategy to integrate multimodal features. These multimodal features are further utilized for conversational emotion recognition. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (i.e., IEMOCAP, MELD, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI) demonstrate that SMIN succeeds over existing state-of-the-art strategies on emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of user-generated videos in online websites, it becomes particularly important to achieve automatic perception and understanding of human emotion/sentiment from these videos. In this paper, we present our solutions to the MuSe-Wilder and MuSe-Sent sub-challenges in MuSe 2021 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge. MuSe-Wilder focuses on continuous emotion (i.e., arousal and valence) recognition while the task of MuSe-Sent concentrates on discrete sentiment classification. To this end, we first extract a variety of features from three common modalities (i.e., audio, visual, and text), including both low-level handcrafted features and high-level deep representations from supervised/unsupervised pre-trained models. Then, the long short-term memory recurrent neural network, as well as the self-attention mechanism is employed to model the complex temporal dependencies in the feature sequence. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) loss and F1-loss are used to guide continuous regression and discrete classification, respectively. To further boost the model's performance, we adopt late fusion to exploit complementary information from different modalities. Our proposed method achieves CCCs of 0.4117 and 0.6649 for arousal and valence respectively on the test set of MuSe-Wilder, which outperforms the baseline system (i.e., 0.3386 and 0.5974) by a large margin. For MuSe-Sent, F1-scores of 0.3614 and 0.4451 for arousal and valence are obtained, which also outperforms the baseline system significantly (i.e., 0.3512 and 0.3291). With these promising results, we ranked top3 in both sub-challenges.",

      "abstract": "Automatic estimation of emotional state has a wide application in human-computer interaction. In this paper, we present our solutions for the MuSe-Stress and MuSe-Physio sub-challenge of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MuSe 2021). The goal of these two sub-challenges is to perform continuous emotion predictions from people in stressed dispositions. To this end, we first extract both handcrafted features and deep representations from multiple modalities. Then, we explore the Long Short-Term Memory network and Transformer Encoder with Multimodal Multi-head Attention to model the complex temporal dependencies in the sequence. Finally, we adopt the early fusion, late fusion and model fusion to boost the model's performance by exploiting complementary information from different modalities. Our method achieves CCC of 0.6648, 0.3054 and 0.5781 for valence, arousal and arousal plus EDA (anno12_EDA). The results of valence and anno12_EDA outperform the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.5614 and 0.4908, and both rank Top3 in these challenges.",

      "abstract": "The conventional encoder-decoder framework for image captioning generally adopts a single-pass decoding process, which predicts the target descriptive sentence word by word in temporal order. Despite the great success of this framework, it still suffers from two serious disadvantages. Firstly, it is unable to correct the mistakes in the predicted words, which may mislead the subsequent prediction and result in error accumulation problem. Secondly, such a framework can only leverage the already generated words but not the possible future words, and thus lacks the ability of global planning on linguistic information. To overcome these limitations, we explore a universal two-pass decoding framework, where a single-pass decoding based model serving as the Drafting Model first generates a draft caption according to an input image, and a Deliberation Model then performs the polishing process to refine the draft caption to a better image description. Furthermore, inspired from the complementarity between different modalities, we propose a novel Cross Modification Attention (CMA) module to enhance the semantic expression of the image features and filter out error information from the draft captions. We integrate CMA with the decoder of our Deliberation Model and name it as Cross Modification Attention based Deliberation Model (CMA-DM). We train our proposed framework by jointly optimizing all trainable components from scratch with a trade-off coefficient. Experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our approach obtains significant improvements over single-pass decoding baselines and achieves competitive performances compared with other state-of-the-art two-pass decoding based methods.",

      "abstract": "We introduce BEHAVIOR, a benchmark for embodied AI with 100 activities in simulation, spanning a range of everyday household chores such as cleaning, maintenance, and food preparation. These activities are designed to be realistic, diverse, and complex, aiming to reproduce the challenges that agents must face in the real world. Building such a benchmark poses three fundamental difficulties for each activity: definition (it can differ by time, place, or person), instantiation in a simulator, and evaluation. BEHAVIOR addresses these with three innovations. First, we propose an object-centric, predicate logic-based description language for expressing an activity's initial and goal conditions, enabling generation of diverse instances for any activity. Second, we identify the simulator-agnostic features required by an underlying environment to support BEHAVIOR, and demonstrate its realization in one such simulator. Third, we introduce a set of metrics to measure task progress and efficiency, absolute and relative to human demonstrators. We include 500 human demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) to serve as the human ground truth. Our experiments demonstrate that even state of the art embodied AI solutions struggle with the level of realism, diversity, and complexity imposed by the activities in our benchmark. We make BEHAVIOR publicly available at behavior.stanford.edu to facilitate and calibrate the development of new embodied AI solutions.",

      "abstract": "Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) requires a thorough understanding of both the linguistic content of an utterance (i.e., textual information) and how the speaker utters it (i.e., acoustic information). The one vital challenge in SER is how to effectively fuse these two kinds of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Cross- and Self-Attention Network (MCSAN) to tackle this problem. The core of MCSAN is to employ the parallel cross- and self-attention modules to explicitly model both inter- and intra-modal interactions of audio and text. Specifically, the cross-attention module utilizes the cross-attention mechanism to guide one modality to attend to the other modality and update the features accordingly. Similarly, the self-attention module employs the self-attention mechanism to propagate information within each modality. We evaluate MCSAN on two benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.",

      "abstract": "In a typical voice conversion system, previous works utilized various acoustic features (such as the pitch, voiced/unvoiced flag and aperiodicity) of the source speech to control the prosody of converted speech. However, prosody is related with many factors, such as the intonation, stress and rhythm. It is a challenging task to perfectly describe prosody through hand-crafted acoustic features. To address these difficulties, we propose to use prosody embeddings to describe prosody. These embeddings are learned from the source speech in an unsupervised manner. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on our Mandarin corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed method can improve the speech quality and speaker similarity of the converted speech. What's more, we observe that our method can even achieve promising results in singing conditions.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversation is a crucial topic for its widespread applications in the field of human-computer interactions. Unlike vanilla emotion recognition of individual utterances, conversational emotion recognition requires modeling both context-sensitive and speaker-sensitive dependencies. Despite the promising results of recent works, they generally do not leverage advanced fusion techniques to generate the multimodal representations of an utterance. In this way, they have limitations in modeling the intra-modal and cross-modal interactions. In order to address these problems, we propose a multimodal learning framework for conversational emotion recognition, called conversational transformer network (CTNet). Specifically, we propose to use the transformer-based structure to model intra-modal and cross-modal interactions among multimodal features. Meanwhile, we utilize word-level lexical features and segment-level acoustic features as the inputs, thus enabling us to capture temporal information in the utterance. Additionally, to model context-sensitive and speaker-sensitive dependencies, we propose to use the multihead attention based bi-directional GRU component and speaker embeddings. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method shows an absolute 2.1~6.2% performance improvement on weighted average F1 over state-of-the-art strategies.",

      "abstract": "Continuous emotion recognition is a challenging task and a key part of human-computer interaction, especially multimodal emotion recognition can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of recognition. But there are limited emotion data sets, and it is difficult to extract emotion features. We present a multi-level segmented decision level fusion emotion recognition model to improve the performance of emotion recognition. In this paper, we predict multi-modal dimensional emotional state on AVEC2017 dataset. Our model uses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) as multi-level segmented emotional feature learning model, and uses the SVR model as fusion model of the decision layer. The BLSTM can model different forms of emotional information in time, and can also consider the impact of previous and later emotional features on current results. The SVR model can compensate for the redundant information of emotion recognition. At the same time, we also consider annotation delay and temporal pooling in our multi-modal dimensional emotion recognition model. Our multi-modal emotion recognition model achieves significant recognition improvements and provide the robustness. Finally, we compare the baseline methods which used the same dataset, and find that the CCC performance of our method is the best on arousal, which is 0.685. Our research shows that the proposed multi-layer segmentation decision level fusion emotion recognition model is conducive to improving performance.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents our CASIA (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation) voice conversion system for the Voice Conversation Challenge 2020 (VCC 2020). The CASIA voice conversion system can be separated into two modules: the conversion model and the vocoder. We first extract linguistic features from the source speech. Then, the conversion model takes these linguistic features as the inputs, aiming to predict the acoustic features of the target speaker. Finally, the vocoder utilizes these predicted features to generate the speech waveform of the target speaker. In our system, we utilize the CBHG conversion model and the LPCNet vocoder for speech generation. To better control the prosody of the converted speech, we utilize acoustic features of the source speech as additional inputs, including the pitch, voiced/unvoiced flag and band aperiodicity. Since the training data is limited in VCC 2020, we build our system by combining the initialization using a multi-speaker data and the adaptation using limited data of the target speaker. The results of VCC 2020 rank our CASIA system in the second place with an overall mean opinion score of 3.99 for speaker quality and 84% accuracy for speaker similarity.",

      "abstract": "Physiological studies have shown that there are some differences in speech and facial activities between depressive and healthy individuals. Based on this fact, we propose a novel spatio-temporal attention (STA) network and a multimodal attention feature fusion (MAFF) strategy to obtain the multimodal representation of depression cues for predicting the individual depression level. Specifically, we first divide the speech amplitude spectrum/video into fixed-length segments and input these segments into the STA network, which not only integrates the spatial and temporal information through attention mechanism, but also emphasizes the audio/video frames related to depression detection. The audio/video segment-level feature is obtained from the output of the last full connection layer of the STA network. Second, this article employs the eigen evolution pooling method to summarize the changes of each dimension of the audio/video segment-level features to aggregate them into the audio/video level feature. Third, the multimodal representation with modal complementary information is generated using the MAFF and inputs into the support vector regression predictor for estimating depression severity. Experimental results on the AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 depression databases illustrate the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Automatic perception and understanding of human emotion or sentiment has a wide range of applications and has attracted increasing attention nowadays. The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Real-life Media (MuSe) 2020 provides a testing bed for recognizing human emotion or sentiment from multiple modalities (audio, video, and text) in the wild scenario. In this paper, we present our solutions to the MuSe-Wild sub-challenge of MuSe 2020. The goal of this sub-challenge is to perform continuous emotion (arousal and valence) predictions on a car review database, Muse-CaR. To this end, we first extract both handcrafted features and deep representations from multiple modalities. Then, we utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network as well as the self-attention mechanism to model the complex temporal dependencies in the sequence. The Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) loss is employed to guide the model to learn local variations and the global trend of emotion simultaneously. Finally, two fusion strategies, early fusion and late fusion, are adopted to further boost the model's performance by exploiting complementary information from different modalities. Our proposed method achieves CCC of 0.4726 and 0.5996 for arousal and valence respectively on the test set, which outperforms the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.2834 and 0.2431.",

Compared with decision level and feature level fusion, model level fusion makes better use of the advantages of deep neural networks. In this work, we utilize the Transformer model to fuse audio-visual modalities on the model level. Specifically, the multi-head attention produces multimodal emotional intermediate representations from common semantic feature space after encoding audio and visual modalities. Meanwhile, it also can learn long-term temporal dependencies with self-attention mechanism effectively. The experiments, on the AVEC 2017 database, shows the superiority of model level fusion than other fusion strategies. Moreover, we combine the Transformer model and LSTM to further improve the performance, which achieves better results than other methods.",

The higher the awareness of risk perception, the higher the friendliness of environmental protection behavior. 3. The stronger the law-abiding consciousness, the higher the friendliness of environmental protection behavior. 4. Individual cognitive ability has a positive and significant impact on environmental knowledge, risk perception and law-abiding consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we investigated the effect of electrical pulses upon a supramolecular hybrid comprised of pentacenes and 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzenes at the octanoic acid/graphite interface. STM results revealed that positive electrical pulses can promote the formation of such hybrids, whereas negative pulses selectively remove pentacene molecules from the complex. We attribute such results to the voltage-pulse-induced instant electrical attraction and repulsion between pentacene and substrate, thereby inducing the hybrid to form or to deform, respectively. Furthermore, these observed phenomena were elucidated via a coarse-grained molecular dynamic model using the continuum approximation.",

      "abstract": "In practical applications for emotion recognition, users do not always exist in the training corpus. The mismatch between training speakers and testing speakers affects the performance of the trained model. To deal with this problem, we need our model to focus on emotion-related information, while ignoring the difference between speaker identities. In this paper, we look into the use of the domain adversarial neural network (DANN) to extract a common representation between different speakers. The primary task is to predict emotion labels. The secondary task is to learn a common representation where speaker identities can not be distinguished. By using the gradient reversal layer, the gradients coming from the secondary task are used to bring the representations for different speakers closer. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on the IEMOCAP database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework shows an absolute improvement of 3.48% over state-of-the-art strategies.",

      "abstract": "Different from the emotion recognition in individual utterances, we propose a\\nmultimodal learning framework using relation and dependencies among the\\nutterances for conversational emotion analysis. The attention mechanism is\\napplied to the fusion of the acoustic and lexical features. Then these fusion\\nrepresentations are fed into the self-attention based bi-directional gated\\nrecurrent unit (GRU) layer to capture long-term contextual information. To\\nimitate real interaction patterns of different speakers, speaker embeddings are\\nalso utilized as additional inputs to distinguish the speaker identities during\\nconversational dialogs. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we\\nconduct experiments on the IEMOCAP database. Experimental results demonstrate\\nthat our method shows absolute 2.42% performance improvement over the\\nstate-of-the-art strategies.\\n",

Prior researches have exploited emotional temporal contexts from two perspectives, which are based on feature representations and emotional models. In this paper, we explore the model based approaches for continuous emotion recognition. Specifically, three temporal models including LSTM, TDNN and multi-head attention models are utilized to learn long-term contexts dependencies based on short-term feature representations. The temporal information learned by the temporal models allows the network to more easily exploit the slow changing dynamics between emotional states. Our experimental results demonstrate that the temporal models can model emotional long-term dynamic information effectively. Multi-head attention model achieves best performance among three models and multi-model combination models further improve the performance of continuous emotion recognition significantly.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Here, water flow inside large radii semi-infinite carbon nanotubes is investigated. Permeable wall taking into account the molecular interactions between water and a nanotube, and the slip boundary condition will be considered. Furthermore, interactions among molecules are approximated by the continuum approximation. Incompressible and Newtonian fluid is assumed, and the Navier-Stokes equations, after certain assumptions, transformations and derivations, can be reduced into two first integral equations. In conjunction with the asymptotic expansion technique, we are able to derive the radial and axial velocities analytically, capturing the effect of the water leakage, where both mild and exceptionally large leakages will be considered. The radial velocity obeys the prescribed boundary condition at the (im)permeable wall. Through the mean of the radial forces, the sufficiently large leakages will enhance the radial velocity at the center of the tube. On the other hand, unlike the classical laminar flow, the axial velocity attains its maximum at the wall due to the coupling effect with the radial forces as water is being pushed into the proximity of the inner wall. In addition, the axial velocity and the flux with the consideration of the suck-in forces, induced by the tubes’ entry turn out to be one order higher than that without the suck-in forces. All the aforementioned considerations might partially resolve the mysteriously high water penetration through nanotubes. Axial velocity also drops with the tube’s length when the water leakage is permitted and the suck-in forces will ease the decline rate of the axial velocity. The present mathematical framework can be directly employed into the water flow inside other porous nano-materials, where large water leakage is permitted and therefore are of huge practical impact on ultra-filtration and environmental protection.",

      "abstract": "As a major component of speech signal processing, speech emotion recognition has become increasingly essential to understanding human communication. Benefitting from deep learning, many researchers have proposed various unsupervised models to extract effective emotional features and supervised models to train emotion recognition systems. In this paper, we utilize semi-supervised ladder networks for speech emotion recognition. The model is trained by minimizing the supervised loss and auxiliary unsupervised cost function. The addition of the unsupervised auxiliary task provides powerful discriminative representations of the input features, and is also regarded as the regularization of the emotional supervised task. We also compare the ladder network with other classical autoencoder structures. The experiments were conducted on the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) database, and the results reveal that the proposed methods achieve superior performance with a small number of labelled data and achieves better performance than other methods.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition is a challenging task due to its low intensity and short duration and how to extract the subtle facial changes is a key issue in this field. Although there are many methods attempt to cope with this problem, they are difficult to encode the temporal order of all frames in the video clips. For these reasons, this paper employs rank pooling and ℓ <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,1</sub> -norm to obtain the discriminative video representation with temporal order. In particular, we extract Local Two-Order Gradient Pattern (LTOGP) feature of each frame to describe the subtle information. Then, the video representation is generated by using rank pooling, which captures the temporal order among all frames. Furthermore, considering the sparsity of ℓ <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,1</sub> -norm, we can select those discriminant features. Finally, micro-expression classification is accomplished using SVM. Experiments are conducted on two publicly available micro-expression databases i.e. CASME and CASME2. The results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

A new parameter estimation method for atmospheric scattering model is proposed. Firstly, the sky and non-sky areas are segmented. Then, estimating the atmospheric light at the junction, and then corresponding restrictions on the value of transmittance according to the change of the depth of field. Finally, the transmittance is optimized by context-based regularization, so that the final image after dehazing is more in line with the visual characteristics. Through the subjective comparison and analysis with the existing mainstream algorithms, the dehazing effect of the proposed method has the advantages of low noise and high color recovery, especially in the sky. The restoration with the non-sky junction is the best, enriching the details that other algorithms have not restored and the colors are true and natural.",

      "abstract": "Learning from multiple annotations is an increasingly important research topic. Compared with conventional classification or regression problems, it faces more challenges because time-continuous annotations would result in noisy and temporal lags problems for continuous emotion recognition. In this paper, we address the problem by deep learning for continuous multiple time series annotations. We attach a novel crowd layer to the output layer of basic continuous emotion recognition system, which learns directly from the noisy labels of multiple annotators with end-to-end manner. The inputs of the system are multimodal features and the targets are multiple annotations, with the intention of learning an annotator-specific mapping. Our proposed method considers the ground truth as latent variables and multiple annotations are variant of ground truth by linear mapping. The experimental results show that our system can achieve superior performance and capture the reliabilities and biases of different annotators.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents our effects for Cross-cultural Emotion Sub-challenge in the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2018, whose goal is to predict the level of three emotional dimensions time-continuously in a cross-cultural setup. We extract the emotional features from audio, visual and textual modalities. The state of art regressor for continuous emotion recognition, long short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) is utilized. We augment the training data by replacing the original training samples with shorter overlapping samples extracted from them, thus multiplying the number of training samples and also beneficial to train emotional temporal model with LSTM-RNN. In addition, two strategies are explored to decrease the interlocutor influence to improve the performance. We also compare the performance of feature level fusion and decision level fusion. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method and competitive results are obtained.",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition is a challenging task. In this paper, we present our effort for the audio-video based sub-challenge of the Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) 2018 challenge, which requires participants to assign a single emotion label to the video clip from the six universal emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sad and Surprise) and Neutral. The proposed multimodal emotion recognition system takes audio, video and text information into account. Except for handcraft features, we also extract bottleneck features from deep neutral networks (DNNs) via transfer learning. Both temporal classifiers and non-temporal classifiers are evaluated to obtain the best unimodal emotion classification result. Then possibilities are extracted and passed into the Beam Search Fusion (BS-Fusion). We test our method in the EmotiW 2018 challenge and we gain promising results. Compared with the baseline system, there is a significant improvement. We achieve 60.34% accuracy on the testing dataset, which is only 1.5% lower than the winner. It shows that our method is very competitive.",

      "abstract": "As a major branch of speech processing, speech emotion recognition has drawn much attention of researchers. Prior works have proposed a variety of models and feature sets for training a system. In this paper, we propose to use semi-supervised learning with ladder networks to generate robust feature representation for speech emotion recognition. In our method, the input of ladder network is the normalized static acoustic features and is mapped to high level hidden representations. The model is trained to simultaneously minimize the sum of supervised and unsupervised cost functions by back-propagation. The extracted hidden representations are used as emotional features in SVM model for speech emotion recognition. The experimental results, performed on IEMOCAP database, show 2.6% higher performance than denoising auto-encoder, and 5.3% than the static acoustic features.",

      "abstract": "Facial emotion recognition is an essential aspect in human-machine interaction. In the real-world conditions, it faces many challenges, i.e., illumination changes, large pose variations and partial or full occlusions, which cause different facial areas with different sharpness and completeness. Inspired by this fact, we focus on facial expression recognition based on partial faces in this paper. We compare contribution of seven facial areas of low-resolution images, including nose areas, mouse areas, eyes areas, nose to mouse areas, nose to eyes areas, mouth to eyes areas and the whole face areas. Through analysis on the confusion matrix and the class activation map, we find that mouth regions contain much emotional information compared with nose areas and eyes areas. In the meantime, considering larger facial areas is helpful to judge the expression more precisely. To sum up, contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) We reveal concerned areas of human in emotion recognition. (2) We quantify the contribution of different facial parts.",

      "abstract": "Conventional continuous emotion recognition consists of feature extraction step followed by regression step. However, the objective of the two steps is not consistent as they are parted. Besides, there is still no consensus about appropriate emotional features. In this study, we propose an end-to-end continuous emotion recognition framework which merges feature extraction and regressor into a unified system. We employ 3D convolutional networks with Long Short-Term Memory Neutral Network (ConvLSTM) to handle spatiotemporal information for continuous emotion recognition. This model is applied on AVEC 2017 database. The experiment results reveal that ConvLSTM model makes a positive effect on the performance improvement, which outperforms the baseline results for arousal of 0.583 vs 0.525 (baseline) and for valence of 0.h54 vs 0.507.",

      "abstract": "The continuous dimensional emotion can depict subtlety and complexity of emotional change, which is an inherently challenging problem with growing attention. This paper presents our automatic prediction of dimensional emotional state for Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC 2017), which uses multi-features and fusion across all available modalities. Besides the baseline features provided by the organizers, we also extract other acoustic audio feature sets, appearance features and deep visual features as complementary features. Each type of feature is trained using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neutral Network (LSTM-RNN) for every dimensional emotion prediction separately considering annotation delay and temporal pooling. To overcome overfitting problem, robust models are chosen carefully for individual model. Finally, multimodal emotion fusion is achieved by utilizing Support Vector Regression (SVR) with the estimates from different feature sets in decision level fusion. The experimental results indicate that our extracted features are beneficial to performance improvement and our system design achieves very promising results with Concordant Correlation Coefficient (CCC), which outperform the baseline system on the testing set for arousal of 0.599 vs 0.375 (baseline) and for valence of 0.721 vs 0.466 and for liking 0.295 vs 0.246.",

This paper designs a stiffened plate structure of resonant loading and data acquisition system to accomplish the above objectives. Experiments show that the whole process of the experimental system is relatively stable, operable, and can be able to complete the expected experimental objectives, while provide a strong support to the structural vibration fatigue on the further study.",

      "abstract": "The vital status and uniqueness of the cultural and creative industries means that intellectual property protection is of paramount importance to these industries, whose very survival depends upon creativity and intellectual property. Intellectual property protection is the foundation of the growth and development of these industries. At present, the main challenges to intellectual property protection in China's cultural and creative industries are the weak awareness of the importance of intellectual property protection and the unscientific path choice for intellectual property protection. As such, it's critical to provide comprehensive protection for the cultural and creative industries with an integrated intellectual property protection system that covers patent rights, trademark rights, commercial secret rights, and anti-unfair competition legislation. The implementation of the mechanisms for the cultural and creative industries depends on the initiatives adopted by the different actors in the cultural and creative industries, such as the government, industry associations, intermediary organizations and creative enterprises, on the basis of their respective positions in the development of these industries. Thus, it's imperative to enhance the driving force of \"creativity\", strengthen property protection and capital operation, and build \"cultural creativity + science and technology + finance\" channels for industry realization.",

But because of the large amount of the information and the real-time requirement, the image of target is always distorted and incomplete.To solve this probolem,the image proecessing and target identification method of laser imaging fuze are introduced. Firstly,a thinning algorithm for binary image is proposed to get the target skeleton. Secondly, the feature of the target is extracted, this kind of feature is very helpful on the hardware design of system. Finally ,the FMW (Feature Mapping Wave) network is developed from M-P network and ART theory to recognitize target status. This kind of image processing system including plane target identification and the engagement of missile and plane identification. The validity of the system has been validated.",

However, calculating the high dimension fisher ratio is difficult. A new feature selection method, called fisher-and-correlation(FC), is proposed. The proposed method is combining fisher criterion and correlation criterion based on the analysis of feature relevance and redundancy. The proposed methodology is tested in five different classification applications. The presented results confirm that FC performs as well as HDF does at much lower computational complexity.",

      "abstract": "An new enhancement method is proposed to the Stochastic Active Contour Scheme (STACS) for image segmentation using Principle Component Analysis(PCA). STACS is a method developed for segmentation of cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) images and is based on the level set method in which the contour is driven by the minimization of a function of four terms−region based, edge based, shape prior, and curvature. STACS derives each of these forces from the original image that is to be segmented. In our method, PCA is performed on the entire set of eight images of the same slice of the heart taken at different instants of time in the cardiac cycle and then segment each image separately. The various terms in the energy functional in this new scheme are obtained from different principal components(Eigenvectors). Thus, STACS is improved by emphasizing each term in the energy functional with the help of the principal component that gives the most accurate result. Experimental results are presented with the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract": "Feature selection is one of the most important issues in the fields such as data mining, pattern recognition and machine learning. In this study, a new feature selection approach that combines the Fisher criterion and principal feature analysis (PFA) is proposed in order to identify the important (relevant and irredundant) feature subset. The Fisher criterion is used to remove features that are noisy or irrelevant, and then PFA is used to choose a subset of principal features. The proposed approach was evaluated in pattern classification on five publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can largely reduce the feature dimensionality with little loss of classification accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Many studies have shown the functional relevance of cross-modal plasticity in blind men. In order to study the changes of their brain structure, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) methods are used. The regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) concentrations of magnetic resonance (MR) images from 11 blind people and 9 sighted control subjects are compared using standard VBM. Optimized VBM is also discussed to measure the absolute local volume of GM or WM. Consistent results are achieved by statistical analysis with these methods. There are distinct differences not only in visual cortex but also the sensory area, auditory area and motor area. GM concentrations in blind men significantly decreased in Brodmann 7 and 22. While in Brodmann 18 and 19, GM concentration increased. GM volumes decreased in Brodmann 3,4,6,9 and 45. On the other hand, both WM concentration and volume increased in Brodmann 7. These results suggest that early visual deprivation can lead to changes in the brain structural anatomy which is consistent with the cortical cross-modal reorganization found by functional imaging. It may help to discover the relationship between the brain structural anatomy and the brain functional data of blind men at a macroscopic level from neuroimaging perspective.",

In this paper, a method and its algorithm DMAR of distributed mining association rules in synchronisms are presented in distributed transaction database environments by using meta-learning technology. The algorithm has higher mining efficiency and lower data communication amount. The distributed factor /spl gamma/ is also defined in the paper, which is to measure the efficiency of mining algorithm, and it is pointed out that the value of /spl gamma/ is related to mining efficiency and data communication amount. Experiments have been conducted to prove the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm DMAR.",

At present some effective platforms for mining have been proposed, but those are versatile and are not aimed at the characteristic of a particular mining task, and thus restrict the mining efficiency. For the question of mining association rules, we present a model of a mining association rule oriented data cube through analyzing the characteristic of the mining association rule and OLAP. The model has been proved correct and feasible by analyzing an application example.",
