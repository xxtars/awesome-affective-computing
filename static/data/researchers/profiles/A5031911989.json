Her work consistently bridges NLP, multimodal learning, and clinical psychology: advancing explainability via cognitive theories (e.g., cognitive distortion), integrating psychiatric scales into LLMs, modeling emotion distributions and causes in context, and addressing data scarcity through weak/low-shot supervision. A clear evolution is visible—from foundational aspect-based sentiment analysis (2010s) to clinically aligned, uncertainty-aware, multimodal, and causally grounded affective systems (2022–2024).",

      "abstract": "Abstract The 4D unconventional fracture network evolution, especially considering the closure state of hydraulic fractures during fracturing stimulations and shale gas productions is not well understood. This paper proposed a novel method to characterize 4D unconventional fracture network evaluations considering dynamic closure of unconventional fractures based on a 4D Hydro-geomechanical model and fiber optics monitoring. First, we summarized the geological deposition, tectonic features and organic matter resources of the Marcellus shale gas reservoir, and the gas decline law was used to fit and predict the production characteristics of horizontal wells in a certain drilling platform. The unconventional fracture extension simulation was carried out, which combined with microseismic monitoring data to reveal the fracture geometry and stimulation scale: the average propped fracture length of the 22 stages fractured in the well MIP-3H was 120.18 m (394.30 ft), with a height of 23.37 m (77.67 ft). The width of hydraulic fractures was about 1.52 mm (0.06 in) near the wellbore, and the average conductivity was 116.57 mD·m (382.45 mD·ft). Based on the fracture parameters, the four-dimensional (3D + time) reservoir flow and geomechanics coupled model were solved with the finite element method through numerical simulation. During gas production, the formation pressure gradually decreases while the effective stress increases and the reservoir appears a slight deformation. At the fracture surface, the deformation is relatively obvious due to the high effective stress, showing the closure phenomenon finally. In addition, the fracturing and coupled model analysis was validated using the distributed fiber-optic temperature sensing (DTS) monitoring data obtained in the field, which confirms that the dynamic fracture closure does occur in the fractured stage 9 of the MIP-3H well. This work can guide the fracturing design and production prediction of subsequent shale gas development and is of great importance for effective shale resource development.",

      "abstract": "Mental health issues pose significant challenges worldwide, leading researchers to utilize computing techniques to analyze social media posts for early detection. Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) represent advanced AI systems with exceptional language processing capabilities. However, their effectiveness depends on the use of appropriate prompts. The design of suitable prompts specifically for analyzing mental health issues remains underexplored. Drawing inspiration from psychiatrists who use psychiatric scales to assess mental health, we have developed scale-based chains of thought (Scale-CoT) prompts. These not only enhance the LLMs’ ability to detect mental health issues but also increase clarity and explainability by integrating professional scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the knowledge generated by LLMs can be effectively transferred to smaller models, resulting in a better-performing and more lightweight system. Our approach, which leverages psychiatric scales, outperforms existing methods. Our experiments indicate that combining traditional psychiatry with computational techniques is worthwhile and deserving of further research and exploration.",

      "abstract": "As a fine-grained task, multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) mainly focuses on identifying aspect-level sentiment information in the text-image pair. However, we observe that it is difficult to recognize the sentiment of aspects in low-quality samples, such as those with low-resolution images that tend to contain noise. And in the real world, the quality of data usually varies for different samples, such noise is called data uncertainty. But previous works for the MABSA task treat different quality samples with the same importance and ignored the influence of data uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel data uncertainty-aware multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis approach, UA-MABSA, which weighted the loss of different samples by the data quality and difficulty. UA-MABSA adopts a novel quality assessment strategy that takes into account both the image quality and the aspect-based cross-modal relevance, thus enabling the model to pay more attention to high-quality and challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Twitter-2015 dataset. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the quality assessment strategy.",

      "abstract": "Recently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages in model capacity and computational efficiency. However, studies have indicated that MoE Transformers underperform vanilla Transformers in many downstream tasks, significantly diminishing the practical value of MoE models. To explain this issue, we propose that the pre-training performance and transfer capability of a model are joint determinants of its downstream task performance. MoE models, in comparison to vanilla models, have poorer transfer capability, leading to their subpar performance in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, positing that although vanilla models have weaker performance, they are effective teachers of transfer capability. The MoE models guided by vanilla models can achieve both strong pre-training performance and transfer capability, ultimately enhancing their performance in downstream tasks. We design a specific distillation method and conduct experiments on the BERT architecture. Experimental results show a significant improvement in downstream performance of MoE models, and many further evidences also strongly support the concept of transfer capability distillation. Finally, we attempt to interpret transfer capability distillation and provide some insights from the perspective of model feature.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate different abilities of GPT-4V including visual understanding, language understanding, visual puzzle solving, and understanding of other modalities such as depth, thermal, video, and audio. To estimate GPT-4V's performance, we manually construct 656 test instances and carefully evaluate the results of GPT-4V. The highlights of our findings are as follows: (1) GPT-4V exhibits impressive performance on English visual-centric benchmarks but fails to recognize simple Chinese texts in the images; (2) GPT-4V shows inconsistent refusal behavior when answering questions related to sensitive traits such as gender, race, and age; (3) GPT-4V obtains worse results than GPT-4 (API) on language understanding tasks including general language understanding benchmarks and visual commonsense knowledge evaluation benchmarks; (4) Few-shot prompting can improve GPT-4V's performance on both visual understanding and language understanding; (5) GPT-4V struggles to find the nuances between two similar images and solve the easy math picture puzzles; (6) GPT-4V shows non-trivial performance on the tasks of similar modalities to image, such as video and thermal. Our experimental results reveal the ability and limitations of GPT-4V and we hope our paper can provide some insights into the application and research of GPT-4V.",

      "abstract": "The iterative algorithm used in traditional topology optimization methods takes a long time. With the increase of the degree of freedom of the finite element mesh, the calculation time will also exhibit exponential growth, resulting in the problem of dimension explosion. To solve this problem, this paper adopts a fast topology optimization method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By comparing the optimized results and the computational costs between the traditional SIMP method and the Level Set method, this paper proposes to use the fuzzy images obtained from the initial iteration of the SIMP method as training dataset and uses CNN to train them. Based on the fast prediction of the training model, reasonable structural topology can be obtained with a small number of iterations. Based on the classical 88 lines of MATLAB code and the discrete level set MATLAB code, the differences between the traditional iterative optimization algorithm and the CNN-based optimization algorithm are compared by classical cantilever beam examples used as benchmarks. In terms of computational efficiency, these examples are iterated up to 247 times by using the SIMP method and 74 times by using the Level Set method. These two methods took a maximum of 20.72 seconds and 29.36 seconds, respectively. As an improvement, the CNN prediction mode only iterated 10 times with a calculation time of 1.02 seconds. Meanwhile, the model prediction time was negligible. Compared with the traditional iterative modes, the optimization method coupling with SIMP and CNN can significantly improve the computational efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Emotion and sentiment play a central role in various human activities, such as perception, decision-making, social interaction, and logical reasoning. Developing artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) for machines is becoming a bottleneck in human–computer interaction. The first step of AEI is to recognize the emotion and sentiment that are conveyed in different affective signals. Traditional supervised emotion and sentiment analysis (ESA) methods, especially deep learning-based ones, usually require large-scale labeled training data. However, due to the essential subjectivity, complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity, and subtlety, collecting such annotations is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult in practice. In this article, we introduce label-efficient ESA from the computational perspective. First, we present a hierarchical taxonomy for label-efficient learning based on the availability of sample labels, emotion categories, and data domains during training. Second, for each of the seven paradigms, i.e., unsupervised, semisupervised, weakly supervised, low-shot, incremental, domain-adaptive, and domain-generalizable ESA, we give the definition, summarize existing methods, and present our views on the quantitative and qualitative comparison. Finally, we provide several promising real-world applications, followed by unsolved challenges and potential future directions.",

      "abstract": "Emotion Forecasting in Conversations (EFC), the task aims to predict the emotion of next utterance (yet to come), has received more and more attention in recent years. However, this task ignores the one-to-many feature of dialogue and its prediction target is emotion label, which is flawed in most cases. In this work, we propose a new task: Emotion Distribution Forecasting in Conversations (EDFC), which aims to predict the emotion distribution of next utterance. Although this task is more reasonable in real applications, it can only learn using emotion labels in most cases because of the difficulty in obtaining emotion distribution. To address it, we explore the positive role of topic in this task and propose a topic-enhanced approach. Specifically, we first obtain the topic-based emotion distribution prior through topic model and emotion generation model, and then use the emotion distribution prior to enhance original label learning model. To effectively evaluate the distribution prediction results, we construct two datasets for this task, and the experimental results prove the feasibility of the EDFC task as well as the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, adolescents would like to share their daily lives via social media platforms, which presents an excellent opportunity for us to leverage these data to develop techniques to measure their mental health status, such as depression. Previous researches focus on the more accurate detection of depression through statistical learning and ignore psychological understanding of depression. However, psychologists have given lots of theoretical evidence for depression. Such as according to cognitive psychology research, cognitive distortions will result in depression. Thus, in this study, we propose a new task, explainable depression detection, to not only automatically detect depression but also try to give clues to depression based on cognitive distortion theory. For this purpose, we construct a multi-task learning model based on a pre-trained model to detect depression and identify cognitive distortion. And we use many analytical means including word clouds for data analysis to draw our conclusion. Previous social media users' depression corpus and our cognitive distortion corpus are utilized for analysis and experiment. Our experimental results outperform the baseline results and interesting conclusions about adolescent depression are drawn.",

For Track 1, we designed a direct fine-tuning DeBERTa model for three regression tasks at the utterance-level. For Track 2, we designed a multi-task learning RoBERTa model for two regression tasks at the essay-level. For Track 3, we designed a RoBERTa model with data augmentation for the classification task at the essay-level. Finally, our team ranked 1st in the Track 1 (CONV), 5th in the Track 2 (EMP) and 3rd in the Track 3 (EMO) in the evaluation phase.",

Despite previous attempts to detect cognitive distortion through language, progress has been slow due to the lack of appropriate data. In this paper, we present the C2D2 dataset, the first expert-supervised Chinese Cognitive Distortion Dataset, which contains 7,500 cognitive distortion thoughts in everyday life scenes. Additionally, we examine the presence of cognitive distortions in social media texts shared by individuals diagnosed with mental disorders, providing insights into the association between cognitive distortions and mental health conditions. We propose that incorporating information about users’ cognitive distortions can enhance the performance of existing models mental disorder detection. We contribute to a better understanding of how cognitive distortions appear in individuals’ language and their impact on mental health.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotion states from multi-modal inputs. Existing end-to-end models typically fuse the uni-modal representations in the last layers without leveraging the multi-modal interactions among the intermediate representations. In this paper, we propose the multi-modal Recurrent Intermediate-Layer Aggregation (RILA) model to explore the effectiveness of leveraging the multi-modal interactions among the intermediate representations of deep pre-trained transformers for end-to-end emotion recognition. At the heart of our model is the Intermediate-Representation Fusion Module (IRFM), which consists of the multi-modal aggregation gating module and multi-modal token attention module. Specifically, at each layer, we first use the multi-modal aggregation gating module to capture the utterance-level interactions across the modalities and layers. Then we utilize the multi-modal token attention module to leverage the token-level multi-modal interactions. The experimental results on IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance, benefiting from fully exploiting the multi-modal interactions among the intermediate representations.",

      "abstract": "Objective 5p deletion syndrome, that characterized by cat-like cry and peculiar timbre of voice, is believed to be one of the most common pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs). Variable critical regions on 5p involving a variety of genes contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity without specific correlation. The objective of this study was to examine the genotype–phenotype correlation of 5p deletion syndrome, and to redefine 5p deletion syndrome relevant regions. In addition, we demonstrate the potential use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify chromosomal breakpoints in prenatal diagnosis. Methods Three families with women undergoing prenatal diagnosis and two children were recruited. Karyotyping, CNV-seq, fluorescence in situ hybridization, WGS, and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify the chromosomal disorder. Results We reported three families and two children with CNVs of 5p deletion or combined 6p duplication. Five different sizes of 5p deletion were detected and their pathogenicity was determined, including 5p15.33-p15.31 [1–7,700,000, family1-variant of uncertain significance (VUS)], 5p15.33 (1–3,220,000, family 2-VUS), 5p15.33-p15.31 (1–7,040,000, family 3-VUS), 5p15.33-p15.31 (1–8,740,000, child 1-pathogenic) and 5p15.31-p15.1 (8,520,001–18,080,000, child 2-pathogenic). One duplication at 6p25.3-p24.3 (1–10,420,000) was detected and determined as likely pathogenic. The chromosomal breakpoints in family 3 were successfully identified by WGS. Conclusion Some critical genes that were supposed to be causative of the symptoms were identified. Relevant region in 5p deletion syndrome was redefined, and the chr5:7,700,000–8,740,000 region was supposed to be responsible for the cat-like cry. The great potential of WGS in detecting chromosomal translocations was demonstrated. Our findings may pave the way for further research on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Potato is one of China's most promising high-production cash crops. However, the frequent occurrence of potato diseases and insect pests directly leads to a considerable crop reduction or low yield, restricting the agricultural economy's development. A variety of potato diseases and insect pests dramatically impact potatoes' quality and production and pose a significant threat to human health. Therefore, it is necessary to use image processing methods to detect potato leaves' growth state at early stages. This study mainly implements the accurate identification of potato blight through the analysis of RGB images and is divided into three parts: data set construction, model construction, and system development. First, this study collected the images of potato blight from the Internet as part of the data set. Blurred and unidentifiable images were removed during data set construction. Then we consulted agricultural experts on crop disease to label the disease types of potato disease image data to construct the labeled potato disease data set. Second, various image filtering algorithms were used to enhance the input image data. A potato blight recognition model was built based on deep learning algorithms. Specifically, the Restnet50 model was used to train the blight classification model. The convolution operation was performed on the input image of 3 channels containing 50 Conv2D functions to distinguish the types and the degree of diseases. Finally, the disease identification software, DiseSniper, was developed based on the trained model. The system was constructed by the agile development software engineering method. Specifically, the software's front end was designed using PyQT5 and implemented the algorithm in the software. Based on the image data set of potato leaves, the accuracy of the test data set reaches more than 98%.",

      "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversations has attained increasing interest in the natural language processing community. Many neural-network based approaches endeavor to solve the challenge of emotional dynamics in conversations and gain appealing results. However, these works are limited in capturing deep emotional clues in conversational context because they ignore the emotion cause that could be viewed as stimulus to the target emotion. In this work, we propose Causal Aware Interaction Network (CauAIN) to thoroughly understand the conversational context with the help of emotion cause detection. Specifically, we retrieve causal clues provided by commonsense knowledge to guide the process of causal utterance traceback. Both retrieve and traceback steps are performed from the perspective of intra- and inter-speaker interaction simultaneously. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better performance over most baseline models.",

The most advanced works achieved good performance to this day. However, most of them has largely focussed on making a breakthrough in accuracy and speed, which has neglect that how to recover the finer texture details. Therefore, in this paper, we first present an Video SR model combined generative adversarial network and recurrent neural network (GAN-RNN) structure. It is forced by the self-attention mechanism to pay great attention to the high-frequency information of the LR frames. The perceptual loss is introduced to retain the high-frequency detail which is different from other video SR network. A great deal of evaluations and comparisons with previous methods have confirmed the merits of the proposed framework which can significantly outperform the current state of the art.",

      "abstract": "Next Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation has attracted extensive attention recently, benefiting from the large volumes of check-in records on location-based social networks (LBSNs). Most of the existing works either consider user's long- and short-term preferences or only one of them, ignoring users' preferences have multiple different resolutions. Moreover, these methods suffer from the high sparsity issue. Although hierarchical category information contributes to alleviating this problem, it has not been fully exploited and integrated with spatiotemporal contexts in next POI recommendation. To this end, we propose a novel method named Hierarchical and Multi-Resolution Preference Modeling (HMRPM), which simultaneously models hierarchical personalized preferences at three different resolutions, i.e., we learn long-term, short-term and transient preferences. HMRPM consists of three corresponding preference modeling modules: (1) The long-term module captures general preferences of users by modeling user-POI interactions and hierarchical category-level interactions. (2) The short-term module utilizes a hierarchical category-aware self-attention mechanism to capture users' recent preferences. Spatiotemporal position embeddings and user-aware attention are also proposed. (3) The transient module captures hierarchical current preferences by modeling hierarchical transient transition patterns. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

Finally, the experimental results were displayed in a visual manner to help users judge the details of the movie content. In this paper, by establishing a bidirectional short-term and short-term memory network model, the opinion target extraction task is translated into a sequence labeling task, which improved the accuracy of opinion object extraction. This paper crawled and organized the Chinese movie review corpus from the Internet and the experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Deletion and duplication of the -3.7 Mb region in 17p11.2 result in two reciprocal syndromes, Smith-Magenis syndrome and Potocki-Lupski syndrome, which are well-known development disorders. The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence, genetic characteristics and clinical phenotype of 17p11.2 deletion/duplication in Chinese children with development delay and in fetuses with potential congenital defects. Methods: 7077 children with development delay and/or intellectual disability were screened by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) P245 assay. 7319 fetuses with potential congenital defects were detected using next generation sequencing (NGS) technique. Results: 417 of 7077 children patients were identified to carry chromosome imbalance. Among them, 28 (28/7077, 0.4 %) cases had imbalance at chromosome 17p11.2, of which 12 cases (42.9 %) had heterozygous deletions and 16 (57.1 %) had heterogeneous duplications. The phenotypes of these 28 children were variable, including neurobehavioral disorders, craniofacial/skeletal anomalies, immunologic defects, ocular problems, and organ malformations. 263 of 7319 fetuses were recognized to have genomic copy number variations (CNV). Only 2 of them were found to harbor 17p11.2 imbalance. The fetus with deletion presented with ventricular septal defect and the fetus with reciprocal duplication had cerebral ventricle dilation. Conclusion: Our study highlights the phenotypic variability associated with 17p11.2 variations in China. The results further expand the phenotypic spectrum of SMS/PTLS and increase awareness of these disruptive mutations among clinicians.",

      "abstract": "Sarcasm is a sophisticated linguistic phenomenon and commonly manifests on social media platforms, which poses a great challenge for opinion mining systems. Therefore, multimodal sarcasm detection, which aims to understand the implied sentiment in the video, has gained more and more attention. However, previous works mostly focus on multimodal feature fusion without explicitly modeling the incongruity between modalities, such as expressing verbal compliments while rolling eyes, which is an obvious cue for detecting sarcasm. In this article, we propose the incongruity-aware attention network (IWAN), which detects sarcasm by focusing on the word-level incongruity between modalities via a scoring mechanism. This scoring mechanism could assign larger weights to words with incongruent modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IWAN model, which not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MUStARD dataset but also offers the advantages of interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Obtaining affective response is a key step in building empathetic dialogue systems. This task has been studied a lot in generation-based chatbots, but the related research in retrieval-based chatbots is still in the early stage. Existing works in retrieval-based chatbots are based on Retrieve-and-Rerank framework, which have a common problem of satisfying affect label at the expense of response quality. To address this problem, we propose a simple and effective Retrieve-Discriminate-Rewrite framework. The framework replaces the reranking mechanism with a new discriminate-and-rewrite mechanism, which predicts the affect label of the retrieved high-quality response via discrimination module and further rewrites the affect unsatisfied response via rewriting module. This can not only guarantee the quality of the response, but also satisfy the given affect label. In addition, another challenge for this line of research is the lack of an off-the-shelf affective response dataset. To address this problem and test our proposed framework, we annotate a Sentimental Douban Conversation Corpus based on the original Douban Conversation Corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed framework is effective and outperforms competitive baselines.",

At present, the main measure to solve the crisis of opioids is to prevent the use of recreational drugs. However, addiction to medical drugs is also an important cause of the crisis. In this paper, the related prediction and analysis of these drug use problems are carried out. In view of the many socio-economic factors provided, First of all, MATLAB is adopted for grey relational analysis. Through the ranking of socio-economic factors and the total number of drug reports, the ten factors with the highest correlation degree are obtained. And then we’re sifting through all of these socio-economic factors to determine the nine most numerous factors. Finally, the prediction results of the model are given.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has received much attention recently in the natural language processing community. Considering that the emotions of the utterances in conversations are interactive, previous works usually implicitly model the emotion interaction between utterances by modeling dialogue context, but the misleading emotion information from context often interferes with the emotion interaction. We noticed that the gold emotion labels of the context utterances can provide explicit and accurate emotion interaction, but it is impossible to input gold labels at inference time. To address this problem, we propose an iterative emotion interaction network, which uses iteratively predicted emotion labels instead of gold emotion labels to explicitly model the emotion interaction. This approach solves the above problem, and can effectively retain the performance advantages of explicit modeling. We conduct experiments on two datasets, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Unlike previous stance detection tasks, targets here are not given entities or claims but entire questions, which makes it difficult to capture the semantics of targets and build target-dependent representations of answers. To address them, we introduce the Recurrent Conditional Attention (RCA) model which incorporates a conditional attention structure into the recurrent reading process. RCA iteratively guides the distillation of question semantic with answer information and collects stance-oriented text relating to question, further revealing mutual relationship among stance, answer and question. Experiments on a manually labeled Chinese community QA stance dataset show that RCA outperforms four strong baselines by average 2.90% on macro-F1 and 2.66% on micro-F1 respectively.",

Reviews information can offer help in modeling user's preference and item's performance. Some existing methods utilize reviews for the recommendation. However, few of those models consider the importance of reviews and words in corpus together. Therefore, we propose an approach for rating prediction using a hierarchical attention-based network named HANN, which can distinguish the importance of reviews at both word level and review level for explanations automatically. Experiments on four real-life datasets from Amazon demonstrate that our model achieves an improvement in prediction compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. The hierarchical attention weights in sampled test data verify the effect on selecting informative words and reviews.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been applied to learn transferable features for adapting text classification models from a source domain to a target domain. Conventional domain adaptation used to adapt models from an individual specific domain with sufficient labeled data to another individual specific target domain without any (or with little) labeled data. However, in this paradigm, we lose sight of correlation among different domains where common knowledge could be shared to improve the performance of both the source domain and the target domain. Multi-domain learning proposes learning the sharable features from multiple source domains and the target domain. However, previous work mainly focuses on improving the performance of the target domain and lacks the effective mechanism to ensure that the shared feature space is not contaminated by domain-specific features. In this paper, we use an adversarial training strategy and orthogonality constraints to guarantee that the private and shared features do not collide with each other, which can improve the performances of both the source domains and the target domain. The experimental results, on a standard sentiment domain adaptation dataset and a consumption intention identification dataset labeled by us, show that our approach dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and it is general enough to be applied to more scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Target-polarity word (T-P) collocation extraction is a basic sentiment analysis task, which aims to extract the targets and their modifying polarity words by analyzing the relationships between them. Recent studies rely primarily on syntactic rule matching. However, this kind of method has two disadvantages: (1) the syntactic rules are limited and hard matching is always used during the matching procedure that can result in the low recall value, and (2) this method omits the effect of the latent lexical semantic information on the T-P collocation extraction task. To solve the structured syntactic information loss and the lexical semantic information loss problems, in this paper we study the impact of syntactic and semantic information and incorporate them into kernels to automatically extract T-P collocations. We define a syntactic kernel based on the tree structures between targets and polarity words, and a semantic kernel based on the word semantic representations of them to exploit the good way to represent the two kinds of information with support vector machines. The experiments on four types of product reviews show that based on the basic features, a suitable combination of the syntactic and semantic kernels is very promising for T-P collocation extraction.",

      "abstract": "Product aspect recognition is a key task in fine-grained opinion mining. Current methods primarily focus on the extraction of aspects from the product reviews. However, it is also important to cluster synonymous extracted aspects into the same category. In this paper, we focus on the problem of product aspect clustering. The primary challenge is to properly cluster and generalize aspects that have similar meanings but different representations. To address this problem, we learn two types of background knowledge for each extracted aspect based on two types of effective aspect relations: relevant aspect relations and irrelevant aspect relations, which describe two different types of relationships between two aspects. Based on these two types of relationships, we can assign many relevant and irrelevant aspects into two different sets as the background knowledge to describe each product aspect. To obtain abundant background knowledge for each product aspect, we can enrich the available information with background knowledge from the Web. Then, we design a hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster these aspects into different groups, in which aspect similarity is computed using the relevant and irrelevant aspect sets for each product aspect. Experimental results obtained in both camera and mobile phone domains demonstrate that the proposed product aspect clustering method based on two types of background knowledge performs better than the baseline approach without the use of background knowledge. Moreover, the experimental results also indicate that expanding the available background knowledge using the Web is feasible.",

      "abstract": "A simple, rapid, and specific high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the quantification of ginkgolides in rat plasma, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters of ginkgolides after oral administration of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) was acquired. <b>Methods:</b> Plasma samples were pretreated with ethyl acetate extraction. Sulfamethoxazole was used as the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (2.1 mm×150 mm, 5 μm) with a mobile phase consisting of methanol/0.1% formic acid water (gradient elution: 0~25 min (77:23)→(60:40), V/V) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL·min<sup>-1</sup>. The detection was performed on a triple quadruple tandem mass spectrometer using an electrospray ionization (ESI) source for 25 min. The detection was operated by multiple reaction monitoring(MRM) under negative ionization mode of the transitions of m/z 325→163 for BB, 469→423 for GJ, 439→125 for GC, 453→351 for GA, 423→367 for GB and of m/z 252→156 for sulfamethoxazole (IS) respectively. <b>Results:</b> The pharmacokinetic properties of BB, GJ, GA, GB and GC were in line with the open 2-compartment model after oral administration of GBE in rats; The pharmacokinetic parameters of various lactones were calculated, and drugs-time curve and the curve fitting diagram of 5 ginkgolides were drew; The absorption and distribution rate of BB, GJ, GA, GB and GC were fast in rats in vivo, and half-life of absorption was less than 3 h. <b>Conclusion:</b> The developed LC-ESI (-)/MS/MS (QQQ) method was successfully applied to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters and oral bioavailability of ginkgolides in rats after administration of GBE, which can provide basis for further clinical efficacy studies.",

      "abstract": "Identifying negation scopes in a text is an important subtask of information extraction that can benefit other natural language processing tasks, like relation extraction, question answering and sentiment analysis, and serves the task of social media text understanding. The task of negation scope detection can be regarded as a token-level sequence labelling problem. In this paper, we propose different models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and word embedding that can be successfully applied to such tasks without any task-specific feature engineering effort. Our experimental results show that RNNs, without using any hand-crafted features, outperform feature-rich CRF-based model.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis, which addresses the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has received considerable attention in recent years. In contrast to the traditional coarse-grained sentiment analysis tasks, such as document-level sentiment classification, we are interested in the fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis that aims to identify aspects that users comment on and these aspects' polarities. Aspect-based sentiment analysis relies heavily on syntactic features. However, the reviews that this task focuses on are natural and spontaneous, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a framework of adding a sentiment sentence compression (Sent_Comp) step before performing the aspect-based sentiment analysis. Different from the previous sentence compression model for common news sentences, Sent_Comp seeks to remove the sentiment-unnecessary information for sentiment analysis, thereby compressing a complicated sentiment sentence into one that is shorter and easier to parse. We apply a discriminative conditional random field model, with certain special features, to automatically compress sentiment sentences. Using the Chinese corpora of four product domains, Sent_Comp significantly improves the performance of the aspect-based sentiment analysis. The features proposed for Sent_Comp, especially the potential semantic features, are useful for sentiment sentence compression.",

      "abstract": "Target extraction is an important task in opinion mining. In this task, a complete target consists of an aspect and its corresponding object. However, previous work has always simply regarded the aspect as the target itself and has ignored the important \"object\" element. Thus, these studies have addressed incomplete targets, which are of limited use for practical applications. This paper proposes a novel and important sentiment analysis task, termed aspect-object alignment, to solve the \"object neglect\" problem. The objective of this task is to obtain the correct corresponding object for each aspect. We design a two-step framework for this task. We first provide an aspect-object alignment classifier that incorporates three sets of features, namely, the basic, relational, and special target features. However, the objects that are assigned to aspects in a sentence often contradict each other and possess many complicated features that are difficult to incorporate into a classifier. To resolve these conflicts, we impose two types of constraints in the second step: intra-sentence constraints and inter-sentence constraints. These constraints are encoded as linear formulations, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used as an inference procedure to obtain a final global decision that is consistent with the constraints. Experiments on a corpus in the camera domain demonstrate that the three feature sets used in the aspect-object alignment classifier are effective in improving its performance. Moreover, the classifier with ILP inference performs better than the classifier without it, thereby illustrating that the two types of constraints that we impose are beneficial.",

However, the public emotion distributions are just the shallow analysis of the hot events, more and more people want to know the hidden causation behind the emotion distributions. Thus, this paper presents a deep Event-Emotion analysis system on Microblogs to reveal what causes different emotions of a hot event. We here use several related sub-events to describe a hot event in different perspectives, accordingly these sub-events combined with their different emotion distributions can be used to explain the total emotion distribution of a hot event. Experiments on 15 hot events show that the above idea is reasonable to exploit the emotion causation and can help people better understand the evolution of the hot event. Furthermore, this deep Event-Emotion analysis system also tracks the amount treads and emotion treads of the hot event, and presents the deep analysis based on the user profile.",

      "abstract": "Target-polarity word (T-P) collocation extraction, a basic sentiment analysis task, relies primarily on syntactic features to identify the relationships between targets and polarity words. A major problem of current research is that this task focuses on customer reviews, which are natural or spontaneous, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers. We address this problem by proposing a framework of adding a sentiment sentence compression (Sent Comp) step before performing T-P collocation extraction. Sent Comp seeks to remove the unnecessary information for senti-ment analysis, thereby compressing a complicated sentence into one that is shorter and easier to parse. We apply a discriminative conditional random field model, with some special sentiment-related features, in order to automatically compress sentiment sentences. Experiments show that Sent Comp significantly improves the performance of T-P collocation extraction. 1",

MBOA mimics the development process of magnetosomes (MTSs) in magnetotactic bacteria to solve problems. In this paper, four improved MBOAs are researched. Four pairwise MTSs regulation schemes based on the best individual and randomly chosen one are proposed in order to study which scheme is more suitable for solving optimization problems. They are tested on fourteen standard function problems and compared with many popular optimization algorithms, including PSO, DE, ABC and their variants. Experimental results show that all the schemes of MBOA are effective for solving most of the benchmark functions, but have different performance on a few benchmark functions. The fourth MBOA scheme has superior performance to the compared methods on many benchmark functions.",

      "abstract": "Writing comments on products or news has become a popular activity in social media. The amount of opinionated text available online has been growing rapidly, increasing the need for techniques that can analyze opinions expressed in such text so that reviews can be easily absorbed by users. To date, most techniques depend on annotated corpora. However, existing corpora are almost sentence-level works that ignore important global sentiment information in other sentences. Given the rise of advanced applications, more fine-grained corpora are needed, even at the sentence level. The authors aim to create a fine-grained corpus for Chinese sentiment analysis, and more importantly, explore new sentiment analysis tasks by analyzing the annotated corpus. The proposed fine-grained annotation scheme not only introduces cross-sentence and global sentiment information (such as \"target entity\"') but also includes new sentence-level elements (such as \"implicit aspect\"). Based on this scheme, this corpus can provide a more fine-grained platform for researchers to study algorithms for advanced applications. In addition, an in-depth analysis on the annotated corpus is made and several important but ignored tasks, such as the target-aspect pair extraction task, are explored, which can give useful hints about future directions.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the automatic extraction of domain-specific sentiment word (DSSW), which is a fundamental subtask of sentiment analysis. Most previous work utilizes manual patterns for this task. However, the performance of those methods highly relies on the labelled patterns or selected seeds. In order to overcome the above problem, this paper presents an automatic framework to detect large-scale domain-specific patterns for DSSW extraction. To this end, sentiment seeds are extracted from massive dataset of user comments. Subsequently, these sentiment seeds are expanded by synonyms using a bootstrapping mechanism. Simultaneously, a synonymy graph is built and the graph propagation algorithm is applied on the built synonymy graph. Afterwards, syntactic and sequential relations between target words and high-ranked sentiment words are extracted automatically to construct large-scale patterns, which are further used to extracte DSSWs. The experimental results in three domains reveal the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the task of collocation polarity disambiguation. The collocation refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and a target (such as ⟨long, battery life ⟩ or ⟨long, startup⟩), in which the sentiment orientation of the polarity word (“long”) changes along with different targets (“battery life ” or “startup”). To disambiguate a collocation’s polarity, previous work always turned to investigate the polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then assigned the majority polarity to the collocation. However, these contexts are limited, thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be reliable. We therefore propose an unsupervised three-component framework to expand some pseudo contexts from web, to help disambiguate a collocation’s polarity.Without using any additional labeled data, experiments show that our method is effective. 1",

Abstract:Different from previous works such as hand-crafted patterns and rule based methods, this paper proposes a novel method that uses syntactic paths to automatically recognize the appraisal expressions. In detail, the syntactic paths are first automatically collected to describe the relationships between the polarity words and their corresponding targets. Next, an edit distance based syntactic path matching strategy is used to improve the performance of the exact syntactic path matching method. Experimental results on the camera and MP3 player domains show that (1) syntactic paths are helpful for appraisal expression recognition, and (2) edit distance based syntactic path matching method can further improve the performance of appraisal expression recognition. 参考文献 相似文献 引证文献",

      "abstract": "An appraisal expression is described as a collocation of the polarity word and its modified target, which can be considered as an atomic unit expressing an evaluative stance towards a target. Recognizing appraisal expressions is essential for sentence sentiment classification. However, the relevant research is far from enough. This paper proposes a novel method that uses syntactic paths to recognize appraisal expressions. Compared with the previous work, the proposed syntactic path based method has two advantages: 1) it automatically explores syntactic knowledge, and 2) it covers more syntactic relationships between polarity words and targets. Based on these, this paper applies appraisal expressions to sentence sentiment classification. Some novel features based on appraisal expressions, including semantic features, syntactic features, lexical features and polarity features, are designed to classify sentiment sentences as positive or negative. Experimental results on the camera and MP3 player domains show that the proposed appraisal expression based method outperforms other sentence sentiment classification methods. Moreover, we present a composite classifier to integrate our appraisal expression based feature set and the common-used feature set. Experimental results show that our composite classifier can get a better performance than each of them.",

However, this method limits the recall of the product attribute extraction. We therefore propose a novel approach by generalizing syntactic structures of the product attributes with two strategies: intuitive heuristics and syntactic structure similarity. Experiments show that the proposed approach is effective. 1",

This paper describes a method based on automatic expansion of the event triggers for event type recognition. The event triggers are first extended through a thesaurus to enable the extraction of the candidate events and their candidate types. Then, a binary classification method is used to recognize the candidate event types. This method effectively improves the unbalanced data problem in training models and the data sparseness problem with a small corpus. Evaluations on the ACE2005 dataset give a final F-score of 61.24%, which outperforms traditional methods based on pure machine learning.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: An exact Fourier-based iterative reconstruction technique termed Equally-Sloped Tomography (EST) has recently been developed to allow a reduction of radiation dose while maintaining image quality. Here we optimize this technique by incorporating a Gradient Descent algorithm with mathematical regularization constraints, including the Non-Local Means Total Variation model. Using this technique, we conducted a series of comparative experiments to quantify the image quality, and explore radiation dose reduction in CT through reduction of X-ray flux. Method and Materials: A standard quality control phantom containing multiple contrast visibility and resolution inserts was imaged using a Siemens Somatom Sensation 64 scanner. The X-ray flux was systematically lowered from 583mAs to 39mAs. All scans were performed under axial mode with constant tube current. Comparison reconstructions were produced by Filtered-Back Projection (FBP) with a standard uncropped ramp filter. The resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured and compared as a function of flux. Results: Compared to the FBP reconstruction of 500mAs, the optimized EST reconstruction of 50mAs has comparable SNRs and CNRs. The low-contrast regions of the phantom exhibit similar visibility. In addition, no resolution degradation is observed in the low-dose EST reconstruction. Conclusion: As radiation dose is linearly proportional to the X-ray flux, our results indicate that the optimized EST technique may potentially reduce the CT dose up to 90%, while producing comparable image resolution, quality and contrast as the full-dose FBP reconstruction. The reasons that EST allows for significant reduction of the CT dose are because (i) an exact Fourier-based iterative algorithm is used in the reconstruction where both physical and mathematical constraints can be naturally incorporated, (ii) the algorithm is guided towards a lowest-possible noisy state, which is also strictly consistent with the measured data.

The induced differentiation of bilberry multiple shoot clumps were verified with the improved WPM + ZT (1. 5 mg/L) by orthogonal experiment.",

It is obtained the overall structure of the photoelectric detection system, given design parameters of optical system, presented the image processing algorithm. The clutch plate size by detected is 160mm-430mm, the detection resolution is given 0.1 mm. The experiments is proved that the detection rate of riveting quality and nonparallelism detection can be achieved 100% .The system of structure is reasonably simple, low cost, high reliability, and it is suitable for the automatic production installation.",

A novel \"polarityword-target\" related feature extraction method is proposed. An opinion judgment system is then built based on the sentiment of each sentence predicted by a maximum entropy (ME) classifier with the novel features. The experimental results on two domains show that the special feature extraction methods are promising; the opinion judgment system with 91.5% average accuracy is highly effective.",

It forms the Hopfield neural network by dealing with inequality of weight of network. Using the virtue of CTSA, which includes the ergodicity of Chaos and the memory of Tabu search. This algorithm can avoid the local optimal solution effectively. It can also find several optimal solutions.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

Through grading the indexes of coal and gas outburst and coding Hopfield is trained and the models about coal and gas outburst are classified. Experiments prove the practicability of this model.",

The long transcript of WNK1 gene was weakly expressed in the whole kidney, whereas the short one was mostly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney cortex.
