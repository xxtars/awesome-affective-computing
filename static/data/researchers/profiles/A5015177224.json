A consistent thread is bridging objective signals (e.g., visual, EEG) with subjective emotional experience, while addressing challenges like emotion-label noise, cross-modal alignment, bias mitigation, and psychologically grounded evaluation. Recent work shows increasing integration of clinical neuroscience and real-time adaptive systems.",

      "abstract": "The emotional video captioning (EVC) task, which aims to generate factual descriptions based on the perceived subtle visual emotion cues, has received more and more attention and research. However, EVC is essentially an objective video captioning task, and ignores the subjective emotional reactions of video viewers, which cannot reflect personalized affective understandings of different viewers on the same video. To fill the research gap, we investigate the subjective video captioning (SVC) task in this paper, which aims to generate emotional captions by incorporating viewers' personalized emotional reactions upon the EVC task. SVC is extremely challenging, which lies in two aspects: 1) the correlative emotion perception between subjective and objective emotions and 2) the collaborative generation between emotional and factual information. To this end, we propose the Subjective-Objective Emotion-Correlated Generation Network (SO-ECGN) in this paper. Specifically, our SO-ECGN leverages the proposed dynamic mask attention and emotion domain shifting module to achieve the objective emotion incremental learning, and then, a subjective-objective emotions correlation module is proposed to adaptively combine two perspective emotions to provide accurate emotion guidance (i.e., emotional polarity and intensity) for each generation step. Furthermore, an emotion-correlated decoder is proposed to generate subjective captions by adaptively referring to factual information and emotional information. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach and each proposed module, i.e., reaching 79.2%, 45.1% on BLEU-1, CIDEr metrics on EmVidCap-L dataset.",

      "abstract": "Despite decades of research dominated by the amyloid-beta hypothesis, clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has yet to achieve a decisive breakthrough. This editorial advances an alternative pathological paradigm: the collapse of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) signaling represents a central failure point in the brain's intrinsic defense mechanisms against AD. We dissect the molecular cascade triggered by cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) deficiency, focusing on how reduced persulfidation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) directly promotes Tau hyperphosphorylation and subsequent neuronal injury. A critical message of this commentary is the need to dispel the oversimplified notion that sulfide supplementation alone can confer neuroprotection. Because H₂S works within a narrow therapeutic window and has complex hormetic effects, untargeted dietary or environmental exposure cannot match the spatiotemporal precision of endogenous signaling. Instead, it may increase the risk of toxicity. By integrating analyses of transsulfuration metabolism, mitochondrial function, and nutritional status, we propose a precision medicine framework centered on brain-targeted delivery technologies and metabolic correction strategies to selectively restore compromised H₂S signaling networks. This conceptual shift marks a new direction in AD research, shifting the focus from clearing toxic protein aggregates to restoring endogenous neuronal resilience.",

      "abstract": "Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.",

      "abstract": "Emotional Video Captioning (EVC) is an emerging task that aims to describe factual content with the intrinsic emotions expressed in videos. Existing EVC methods perceive global emotional cues through visual features at first, and then combine them with the video features to guide the emotional caption generation, which ignores the critical characteristic of the EVC task that emotional cues have intrinsic motivational causes reflected in the video content. Such video causes have a facilitative effect on both emotion perception and emotion-attributed caption generation. To this end, a multi-round mutual emotion-cause pair extraction network (MM-ECPE) is proposed in this paper for the joint extraction of emotional cues and visual causes through iterative mutual refinement. Specifically, in the 1st-round mutual learning, we propose a spatio-temporal disentangled visual adaptive refinement (ST-DVAR) and a multi-level video-guided emotion affine transformation (MV-EAT) to achieve preliminary refinement on video features and emotion lexicon to eliminate the noise caused by emotion-irrelevant visual information and video-irrelevant emotional information. Then, in the 2nd-round mutual learning, we exploit the cross-attention of the preliminary refined features and the original features to obtain the ultimate emotional cues and visual causes, and couple them in pair-wise extraction through contrastive loss. Overall, our approach optimizes complex semantic understanding and emotion perception of videos, leading to a promising performance in emotional captioning. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach and each proposed module, e.g., improving the latest records by +97.5% and +76.2% w.r.t. CIDEr and CFS, respectively, on the EVC-MSVD dataset.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR) benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects, including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant challenges with this task.",

      "abstract": "Aging constitutes a major risk factor for pan-cancer development, with epidemiological studies indicating that 60% of new malignancies occur in adults age 65 and older. This review synthesizes cutting-edge insights from single-cell sequencing databases (e.g., TCGA and GEO) that decipher how aging reprograms the tumor microenvironment (TME) to fuel carcinogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed that senescent cell subpopulations (e.g., CDKN2A<sup>+</sup>/LMNB1<sup>-</sup> cells) accumulate in aged tissues at frequencies up to 15%, driving genomic instability and secrete pro-tumorigenic senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors (IL-6 and TGF-β). These factors remodel the TME by inducing fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix degradation, accelerating metastasis by 40-70% in murine models. Crucially, immunosenescence diminishes anti-tumor immunity, with scRNA-seq profiling showing 40-60% increases in exhausted PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells and immunosuppressive myeloid cells in aged TMEs. Pan-cancer analyses have identified conserved aging gene signatures (e.g., p16INK4a upregulation in 12+ cancer types) that correlate with 30-50% poorer survival. While technical challenges persist - including batch effects in scRNA-seq data and low senescent cell abundance (< 5%) - emerging solutions like deep learning can enhance detection sensitivity. Therapeutically, senolytic strategies deplete senescent cells, improving drug response by 3.5-fold in preclinical trials. Future research must integrate multi-omics and AI to examine aging-related targets, advancing personalized interventions for aging-associated malignancies.",

      "abstract": "Hioredoxins are small proteins crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and are involved in various biological processes, including growth, photosynthesis, development, and stress responses. This study aims to conduct a genome-wide analysis of the typical Thioredoxin (TRX) gene family in hexaploid Camellia oleifera and explore the role of the CoTRX25 gene in flowering. Through bioinformatics approaches, we identified 27 typical TRX gene family members in the C. oleifera genome and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, conserved motifs, and chromosomal distributions. Transcriptomic analysis across different tissues was performed to determine the expression patterns of these genes. Additionally, the CoTRX25 gene was cloned and heterologously overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate its functional role in flowering. The 27 TRX genes were mainly located on 11 chromosomes, with multiple gene duplication events identified, indicating that gene duplication has played a significant role in the expansion of the TRX family. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that most typical TRX genes are highly expressed in embryos, suggesting their potential importance in seed development. Overexpression of CoTRX25 in A. thaliana led to delayed flowering, implying that this gene may be involved in flowering regulation. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the functions of typical TRX genes in C. oleifera growth and development, particularly highlighting the role of CoTRX25 in flowering regulation.",

      "abstract": "Herpes Zoster (HZ), caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is a common infectious disease. Recent studies suggest a potential association between HZ and the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Epidemiological evidence indicates that HZ infection, especially in individuals with central nervous system involvement, may increase the risk of dementia. Pathologically, VZV may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration by inducing chronic neuroinflammation, infection-related cerebrovascular lesions, and direct central nervous system toxicity. HZ vaccines, particularly novel recombinant subunit vaccines (e.g., Shingrix), not only effectively prevent HZ but may also confer cognitive protection through mechanisms such as \"trained immunity\" activation and anti-inflammatory response modulation. Multiple natural experiments and retrospective cohort studies have found that HZ vaccination is significantly associated with a reduced risk of dementia, with particularly pronounced protective effects in women and older adults. Although most evidence currently stems from observational studies and is subject to potential confounding factors, the biological plausibility and consistent findings support the potential of HZ vaccination as an adjunctive strategy for dementia prevention. Future prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to further clarify the causal relationship and underlying neuroimmune mechanisms, providing a stronger evidence base for establishing scientific vaccination strategies for older adults and dementia prevention systems.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive cognitive decline and diverse neuropathological features. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided unprecedented insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the AD brain. This review systematically summarizes the applications of single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches in AD research, with a focus on the characterization of cell type- and subtype-specific transcriptomic alterations. This review highlights key discoveries related to selectively vulnerable neuronal and glial subpopulations, as well as transcriptional dysregulation associated with genetic risk loci such as APOE and TREM2. This review also discusses how the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), and spatial transcriptomics elucidates disease trajectories and cellular communication networks across pathological stages. These insights not only enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD but also pave the way for precision medicine through the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "Stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, frequently resulting in impairments in motor control, cognition, and emotional regulation. Conventional rehabilitation approaches, while partially effective, often lack individualization and yield suboptimal outcomes. In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has emerged as a promising neurorehabilitation tool by decoding neural signals and providing real-time feedback to enhance neuroplasticity. This review systematically explores the use of BCI systems in post-stroke rehabilitation, focusing on three core domains: motor function, cognitive capacity, and emotional regulation. This review outlines the neurophysiological principles underpinning BCI-based motor rehabilitation, including neurofeedback training, Hebbian plasticity, and multimodal feedback strategies. It then examines recent advances in upper limb and gait recovery using BCI integrated with functional electrical stimulation (FES), robotics, and virtual reality (VR). Moreover, it highlights BCI's potential in cognitive and language rehabilitation through EEG-based neurofeedback and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and immersive VR environments. In addition, it discusses the role of BCI in monitoring and regulating post-stroke emotional disorders via closed-loop systems. While promising, BCI technologies face challenges related to signal accuracy, device portability, and clinical validation. Future research should prioritize multimodal integration, AI-driven personalization, and large-scale randomized trials to establish long-term efficacy. This review underscores BCI's transformative potential in delivering intelligent, personalized, and cross-domain rehabilitation solutions for stroke survivors.",

      "abstract": "Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to generate sign videos corresponding to spoken language sentences, where the conversion of sign Glosses to Poses (G2P) is the key step. Due to the cross-modal semantic gap and the lack of word-action correspondence labels for strong supervision alignment, the SLP suffers huge challenges in linguistics-vision consistency. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based Linguistics-Vision Monotonic Consistent Network (LVMCN) for SLP, which constrains fine-grained cross-modal monotonic alignment and coarse-grained multimodal semantic consistency in language-visual cues through Cross-modal Semantic Aligner (CSA) and Multimodal Semantic Comparator (MSC). In the CSA, we constrain the implicit alignment between corresponding gloss and pose sequences by computing the cosine similarity association matrix between cross-modal feature sequences (i.e., the order consistency of fine-grained sign glosses and actions). As for MSC, we construct multimodal triplets based on paired and unpaired samples in batch data. By pulling closer the corresponding text-visual pairs and pushing apart the non-corresponding text-visual pairs, we constrain the semantic co-occurrence degree between corresponding gloss and pose sequences (i.e., the semantic consistency of coarse-grained textual sentences and sign videos). Extensive experiments on the popular PHOENIX14T benchmark show that the LVMCN outperforms the state-of-the-art.",

However, most of the existing models depend heavily on annotated data, where label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data negatively impacts the generalization performance of DNNs. To this end, recent advances in learning with noisy labels (LNL) adopt the sample selection strategy that identifies clean samples from the noisy dataset to update DNNs, using semi-supervised learning where rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. However, existing LNL methods often overlook the varying fitting difficulties of different classes, resulting in suboptimal sample selection and confirmation bias, and consequently, the errors accumulate during semi-supervised training. In this article, we propose a novel method, TNCollab, which aims at alleviating confirmation bias in both sample selection and semi-supervised training stages via two-network collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a class-adaptive threshold for sample selection to address the varying fitting difficulties across different classes. Additionally, we construct a hard set consisting of samples where the two networks disagree and introduce a noise-robust loss to extract potentially useful information while maintaining robustness against label noise. Furthermore, we propose a dual consistency loss to ensure consistent predictions between the networks across different augmented views of the same sample, facilitating mutual learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TNCollab achieves state-of-the-art performance on image classification and facial expression recognition tasks, particularly on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, WebVision, Clothing1M, Tiny-ImageNet, and RAF-DB datasets, showing improved visual understanding and generalization capabilities.

      "abstract": "Video corpus moment retrieval (VCMR) aims to retrieve a moment from a large corpus of untrimmed videos corresponding to a given language query. However, existing methods often fall short due to their reliance on simple cross-modal attention mechanisms and one-stop localization, which fail to handle the complex multimodal information and large search space effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VCMR method with Query-specific Context Learning and Progressive Localization (QCLPL). First, we construct query-specific multimodal contexts that capture complementary and consistent semantics across subtitles and frames, ensuring informative and efficient context building. We further introduce a semantic contrastive loss to refine these multimodal contexts, filtering out query-irrelevant information. Additionally, we introduce a progressive localization strategy that transforms the moment localization task into a two-stage process. By classifying frames into foreground and background regions, we present a simplified binary classification problem before boundary prediction, constrained by a region-aware loss. This progressive approach leverages region priors to improve subsequent moment localization. Extensive experiments on the TVR and DiDeMo datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, setting a new state of the art for VCMR.",

      "abstract": "Partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task in text-to-video retrieval, where videos are untrimmed and contain much background content. The pursuit here is of both effective and efficient solutions to capture the partial correspondence between text queries and untrimmed videos. Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling multi-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and information redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment discovering (AMDNet). We are committed to discovering video moments that are semantically consistent with their queries. By using learnable span anchors to capture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to emphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve more compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment modeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments of distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically query-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval loss for end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, TVR and ActivityNet Captions) demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our AMDNet. In particular, AMDNet is about 15.5 times smaller (#parameters) while 6.0 points higher (SumR) than the up-to-date method GMMFormer on TVR.",

In this paper, we propose to study <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Grounded TextVideoQA</i> by forcing models to answer questions and spatio-temporally localize the relevant scene-text regions, thus decoupling QA from scene-text recognition and promoting research towards interpretable QA. The task has three-fold significance. First, it encourages scene-text evidence versus other short-cuts for answer predictions. Second, it directly accepts scene-text regions as visual answers, thus circumventing the problem of ineffective answer evaluation by stringent string matching. Third, it isolates the challenges inherited in VideoQA and scene-text recognition. This enables the diagnosis of the root causes for failure predictions, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</i>.<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</i>., wrong QA or wrong scene-text recognition? To achieve Grounded TextVideoQA, we propose the T2S-QA model that highlights a disentangled temporal-to-spatial contrastive learning strategy for weakly-supervised scene-text grounding and grounded TextVideoQA. To facilitate evaluation, we construct a new dataset <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ViTXT-GQA</i> which features 52<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</b> scene-text bounding boxes within 2.2<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</b> temporal segments related to 2<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</b> questions and 729 videos. With ViTXT-GQA, we perform extensive experiments and demonstrate the severe limitations of existing techniques in Grounded TextVideoQA. While T2S-QA achieves superior results, the large performance gap with human leaves ample space for improvement. Our further analysis of oracle scene-text inputs posits that the major challenge is scene-text recognition.

      "abstract": "Video Virtual Try-on aims to seamlessly transfer a reference garment onto a target person in a video while preserving both visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Existing methods typically rely on inpainting masks to define the try-on area, enabling accurate garment transfer in simple scenes (e.g., in-shop videos). However, these mask-based approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios, as overly large and inconsistent masks often destroy spatial-temporal information, leading to distorted results. Mask-free methods alleviate this issue but face challenges in accurately determining the try-on area, especially in videos with dynamic body movements. To address these limitations, we propose PEMF-VTO, a novel Point-Enhanced Mask-Free Video Virtual Try-On framework that leverages sparse point alignments to explicitly guide garment transfer. Our key innovation is the introduction of point-enhanced guidance, which provides flexible and reliable control over both spatial-level garment transfer and temporal-level video coherence. Specifically, we design a Point-Enhanced Transformer (PET) with two core components: Point-Enhanced Spatial Attention (PSA), which uses frame-cloth point alignments to precisely guide garment transfer, and Point-Enhanced Temporal Attention (PTA), which leverages frame-frame point correspondences to enhance temporal coherence and ensure smooth transitions across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PEMF-VTO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generating more natural, coherent, and visually appealing try-on videos, particularly for challenging in-the-wild scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairments. Despite extensive research, its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, and effective treatments are limited. This study explored the therapeutic potential of agarwood in AD by integrating network pharmacology, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and single-cell expression analysis. The results revealed that agarwood compounds may modulate key inflammatory genes such as NFKB1, STAT1, and TLR4, alleviating neuroinflammation; enhance the expression of HSP90 and regulate KDR signaling to improve blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity; and promote the activity of PTPN11 and CXCR4 to support oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) repair and remyelination. Single-cell expression analysis highlighted cell-type-specific expression patterns, particularly in OPCs and endothelial cells, underscoring their relevance in AD pathology. Agarwood's multi-dimensional therapeutic potential positions it as a promising candidate for the development of novel AD treatments.",

      "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) refers to a class of circular, non-chromosomal DNA that has recently gained widespread attention due to its potential role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The generation of ecDNA is closely associated with processes such as double-strand breaks, micronuclei formation, and the breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle, all of which are integral to regulation of gene expression, genetic stability, and clonal evolution. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, the aberrant formation of ecDNA is closely linked to defects in DNA repair, alterations in synaptic plasticity, and neuronal dysfunction. The distinct distribution and functional roles of ecDNA in these conditions make it a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms underlying ecDNA formation and its functions in the nervous system. Additionally, it explores the clinical potential of ecDNA in disease diagnosis, targeted therapy, and personalized medicine, offering new insights for future research and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder, and the current treatment options are limited. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) have garnered significant attention due to their unique biological properties, showcasing tremendous potential as an acellular alternative therapy for AD. MSC-Exos exhibit excellent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, enabling them to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver therapeutic molecules directly to target cells. They are highly efficacious in delivering nucleic acid-based drugs. Moreover, the production process of MSC-Exos benefits from a high proliferation capacity and multilineage differentiation potential, allowing for production while maintaining a stable composition. Despite the significant theoretical advantages of MSC-Exos, their clinical use still faces multiple challenges, including cross-contamination during isolation and purification processes, the complexity of their components, and the presence of potential adverse paracrine factors. Future research needs to focus on optimizing separation and purification techniques, enhancing delivery methods to improve therapeutic efficacy, and performing detailed analyses of the components of MSC-Exos. In summary, MSC-Exos hold promise as an effective option for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, driving their clinical research and use in related fields.",

      "abstract": "Vision-and-language pre-training models have achieved impressive performance for image captioning. But most of them are trained with millions of paired image-text data and require huge memory and computing overhead. To alleviate this, we try to stand on the shoulders of large-scale pre-trained language models (PLM) and pre-trained vision models (PVM) and efficiently connect them for image captioning. There are two major challenges: one is that language and vision modalities have different semantic granularity (e.g., a noun may cover many pixels), and the other is that the semantic gap still exists between the pre-trained language and vision models. To this end, we design a lightweight and efficient connector to glue PVM and PLM, which holds a criterion of selection-then-transformation . Specifically, in the selection phase, we treat each image as a set of patches instead of pixels. We select salient image patches and cluster them into visual regions to align with text. Then, to effectively reduce the semantic gap, we propose to map the selected image patches into text space through spatial and channel transformations. With training on image captioning datasets, the connector learns to bridge the semantic granularity and semantic gap via backpropagation, preparing for the PLM to generate descriptions. Experimental results on the MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate that our method yields comparable performance to existing works. By solely training the small connector, we achieve a CIDEr performance of 132.2% on the MSCOCO Karpathy test split. Moreover, our findings reveal that fine-tuning the PLM can further enhance performance potential, resulting in a CIDEr score of 140.6%.

      "abstract": "Population aging is a global concern, and Japan currently has the world's highest proportion of an aging population. In 2020, the population age 65 and over accounted for 10% of the global population, while this proportion was 29% in Japan, and it is expected to reach 38.4% in 2065. The average life expectancy in Japan in 2022 was 81.05 for males and 87.09 for females. At the same time, Japan's healthy life expectancy continues to increase, and it is increasing at a faster rate than the average life expectancy, with males expected to live 72.68 years and females expected to live 75.38 years in 2019. This is causing the social role of elderly people in Japan to constantly change. The Japanese Government continues to adjust its policy orientation, to improve the health level and social participation of the elderly, improve the accessibility of long-term nursing services and the treatment of nursing professionals, and improve the pension system. By 2025, one-fifth of people in Japan are expected to suffer from dementia. Japan has implemented a series of policies to create a dementia-inclusive and less risky society. The proportion of the population ages 65 and over living alone in Japan increased from 4.3% among males and from 11.2% among females in 1980 to 15.0% among males and 22.1% among females in 2020, representing a sustained increase. Changes in the composition of the population have prompted sustained attention to the personalization and diversification of elderly care. At the same time, Japanese researchers continue to utilize scientific and information technology to innovate elderly care products, improve the efficiency of elderly care, and provide intelligent elderly care.",

This paper explores a challenging task known as syntax-controllable video captioning (SCVC). Specifically, this task aims to generate captions for videos that convey the visual content accurately and adhere to the syntactic structure provided in an example sentence. To tackle the SCVC task, we propose a novel Tree-Structural Syntax Augmentation Network (TSAN). It consists of a tree-structural syntax encoder to capture syntactic parent-child relationships of example sentences and a syntax-customized caption generator to integrate syntax and semantic hints effectively. Moreover, we introduce a syntax-semantic joint optimization strategy that considers both syntax and semantic constraints for joint training. Considering the fact that there are no available syntax-controllable video caption datasets, we use the traditional video captioning dataset to train the model. In the inference process, the model generates syntax-controllable captions in a zero-shot manner, applying exemplar sentences randomly selected from an open corpus and unseen in the training data. The experiments on MSRVTT and VATEX datasets validate the superior performance of TSAN in both semantic and syntactic evaluations. Extensive ablation studies and visualizations further show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to analyze the emotions expressed by the multimodal utterance segments. Most existing methods focused on directly fusing the inputs from different modalities. However, due to the fact in the MSA research that language modality tends to be the most effective, it potentially prompted models to over-rely on language but the sentimental clues in visual and acoustic modalities have been not sufficiently learned. In this paper, we propose a novel Sentiment-oriented Modality Complementarity Network (SMCN) for MSA, which explores the complementary strengths of multimodal representations. Specifically, 1) we consider both video/audio-text and text-audiovisual interactions, which enable the model to explore consistent emotional semantics from different modalities; 2) we perform semantic factorization learning to discover sentiment-discriminative semantics from all modalities, where the model is forced to distinguish the semantic association between multimodal contrastive triplets. The experimental results on two popular MSA benchmarks (i.e., MOSI and MOSEI) demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Extensive ablation studies further show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, due to the stochastic nature of human fixation, the generated dense fixation maps may be a less-than-ideal representation of human fixation. To provide a robust fixation model, we introduce Gaussian Representation for eye fixation modeling. Specifically, we propose to model the eye fixation map as a mixture of probability distributions, namely a Gaussian Mixture Model. In this new representation, we use several Gaussian distribution components as an alternative to the provided fixation map, which makes the model more robust to the randomness of fixation. Meanwhile, we design our framework upon some lightweight backbones to achieve real-time fixation prediction. Experimental results on three public fixation prediction datasets (SALICON, MIT1003, TORONTO) demonstrate that our method is fast and effective.",

      "abstract": "Effectively summarizing and re-expressing video content by natural languages in a more human-like fashion is one of the key topics in the field of multimedia content understanding. Despite good progress made in recent years, existing efforts usually overlooked the emotions in user-generated videos, thus making the generated sentence a bit boring and soulless. To fill the research gap, this paper presents a novel emotional video captioning framework in which we design a Vision-based Emotion Interpretation Network to effectively capture the emotions conveyed in videos and describe the visual content in both factual and emotional languages. Specifically, we first model the emotion distribution over an open psychological vocabulary to predict the emotional state of videos. Then, guided by the discovered emotional state, we incorporate visual context, textual context, and visual-textual relevance into an aggregated multimodal contextual vector to enhance video captioning. Furthermore, we optimize the network in a new emotion-fact coordinated way that involves two losses- Emotional Indication Loss and Factual Contrastive Loss, which penalize the error of emotion prediction and visual-textual factual relevance, respectively. In other words, we innovatively introduce emotional representation learning into an end-to-end video captioning network. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets, EmVidCap and EmVidCap-S, demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Quantitative ablation studies and qualitative analyses clearly show that our method is able to effectively capture the emotions in videos and thus generate emotional language sentences to interpret the video content.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Objective Relapse after detoxification remains a major challenge for addiction treatment worldwide. Although cognitive control impairment is common in heroin use disorder (HUD) patients and is considered a major cause of relapse, it remains unclear after long-term detoxification. The aim of the present study was to assess cognitive control and its association with relapse in HUD patients after prolonged periods of drug abstinence. Methods <bold>A total of</bold> 63 HUD patients (mean abstinence: 12.24 ± 2.92 years), including 41 relapsers and 22 non-relapsers, and 31 healthy volunteers participated in this study. The eye tracking tasks, prospective memory tasks, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) and Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) were used to assess cognitive control. Results HUD patients showed worse saccade error rate but no significant impairment in prospective memory. Furthermore, compared to the non-relapsers, the relapsers performed worse in BRIEF-A scores, antisaccade amplitude and velocity. Moreover, the antisaccade amplitude and velocity were negatively correlated with the BRIEF-A subtest scores. Finally, impairment of inhibition, shift and self-monitoring mediated the association between relapse and poor antisaccade performance. Conclusions Even after prolonged methadone treatment, heroin relapse is associated with worse executive function and antisaccade, and antisaccade amplitude and velocity mainly reflect impairment of inhibition, shift and self-monitoring in executive function.",

      "abstract": "Generating image captions in different languages is worth exploring and essential for non-native speakers. Nevertheless, collecting paired annotation for every language is time-consuming and impractical, particularly for minor languages. To this end, the cross-lingual image captioning task is proposed, which leverages existing image-source caption annotation data and wild unrelated target corpus to generate satisfactory caption in the target language. Current methods perform a two-step translation process of image-to-pivot (source) and pivot-to-target. The distinct two-step process comes with certain caption issues, such as the weak semantic alignment between the image and the generated caption and the generated caption’s non-target language style. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end reinforce learning framework with Visual-linguistic-stylistic Triple Reward named TriR. In TriR, we jointly consider the visual, linguistic, and stylistic alignments to generate factual, fluent, and natural caption in the target language. To be specific, the image-source caption annotation provides factual semantic guidance, whereas the unrelated target corpus guides the language style of generated caption. To achieve this, we construct a visual reward module to measure the cross-modal semantic embedding of image and target caption, a linguistic reward module to measure the cross-linguistic embedding of source and target captions, and a stylistic reward module to imitate the presentation style of target corpus. The TriR can be implemented with either classical CNN-LSTM or prevalent Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments are conducted with four cross-lingual settings, i.e., Chinese-to-English, English-to-Chinese, English-to-German, and English-to-French. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of our method, and sufficient ablation experiments validate the beneficial impact of every reward.",

      "abstract": "In Japan, there is a growing initiative to construct centralized databases and platforms that can aggregate and manage a vast range of medical, health, and caregiving data for research and analysis. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in general-purpose models like the Segment Anything model and Chat GPT, promise significant progress towards utilizing such data-rich platforms effectively for healthcare. Traditionally, AI has displayed superior performance by learning specific images or languages, but now it is advancing towards creating models capable of learning universal traits from images and languages by training on extensive datasets. The challenge lies in the fact that these general-purpose models are trained on data that does not sufficiently incorporate medical information, making their direct application to healthcare difficult. However, the introduction of data platforms can potentially solve this problem. This would lead to the development of universally applicable models to process medical images and AI assistants that can support both doctors and patients. These medical AI assistants can function as a \"sub-doctor\" with extensive knowledge, assisting in comprehensive analysis of symptoms, early detection of rare diseases, and more. They can also serve as an intermediary between the doctor and the patient, helping to simplify consultations and enhance patient understanding of medical conditions and treatments. By bridging this gap, the AI assistant can help to reduce doctors' workload, improve the quality of healthcare, and facilitate early detection and prevention in the elderly population.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has been intensively researched over the last decade, yielding several new models for natural language processing, images, speech and time series processing that have dramatically improved performance. This wave of technological developments in deep learning is also spreading to medicine. The effective use of deep learning in medicine is concentrated in diagnostic imaging-related applications, but deep learning has the potential to lead to early detection and prevention of diseases. Physical aspects of disease that went unnoticed can now be used in diagnosis with deep learning. In particular, deep learning models for the early detection of dementia have been proposed to predict cognitive function based on various information such as blood test results, speech, and the appearance of the face, where the effects of dementia can be seen. Deep learning is a useful diagnostic tool, as it has the potential to detect diseases early based on trivial aspects before clear signs of disease appear. The ability to easily make a simple diagnosis based on information such as blood test results, voice, pictures of the body, and lifestyle is a method suited to point-of-cate testing, which requires immediate testing at the desired time and place. Over the past few years, the process of predicting disease can now be visualized using deep learning, providing insights into new methods of diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "RGB-D image pair based salient object detection models aim to localize the salient objects in an RGB image with extra depth information about the scene provided to guide the detection process. The conventional practice for this task involves explicitly using depth as input to achieve multi-modal learning. In this paper, we observe two main issues within existing RGB-D saliency detection frameworks. Firstly, we claim that it is better to define depth as extra prior information instead of as a part of the input for RGB-D saliency detection, as we can directly perform saliency detection based only on the appearance information from the RGB image, while we cannot perform saliency detection given only the depth data. Secondly, there exists a huge domain gap in terms of the source of depth between different benchmark testing datasets, e.g. depth from Kinect and stereo cameras. In this paper, we focus on the variant of stereo image pair based saliency detection, where the depth is “implicitly” encoded in the stereo image pair for effective RGB-D saliency detection. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our solution.",

Due to the limited receptive field of conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CNN-based multi-modal fusion strategies fail to extensively model the correlation between the two modalities (appearance information from the RGB image and geometric information from the depth data). Given the success of transformer networks for long-range dependency modeling, we investigate multi-modal transformer networks for RGB-D salient object detection. Specifically, a transformer-based multi-modal fusion module is presented to effectively fuse appearance features and geometric features. Experimental results on six challenging benchmark RGB-D salient object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates an emerging and challenging task—emotional video captioning. Formally, given a video, the task aims to not only describe the factual content of the video, but also discover the emotional clues in the video. We propose a novel Contextual Attention Network (CANet), which recognizes and describes the fact and emotion in the video by semantic-rich context learning. To be specific, at each time step, we first extract visual and textual features from both input video and previously generated words. Then, we apply the attention mechanism to these features to capture informative contexts for captioning. We train the CANet model with the joint optimization of cross-entropy loss <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CE}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and contrastive loss <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CL}$</tex-math></inline-formula> , where <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CE}$</tex-math></inline-formula> constrains the semantics of the generated sentence to be close to human annotation and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{CL}$</tex-math></inline-formula> encourages discriminative representation learning from positive and negative pairs of video and caption. Experiments on two emotional video captioning datasets (i.e., EmVidCap and EmVidCap-S) demonstrate the superiority of CANet compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

This paper first established its Adams dynamic model, and then designed a fuzzy PID controller to generate the yaw moment and rear wheel angle. So that the vehicle can track the trajectory of the first axle when turning. Finally, the control model was established in Matlab and simulated jointly with Adams model. The simulation experiments under step input and sinusoidal input were carried out. The results show that the active steering control strategy based on the combination of direct yaw moment and rear wheel angle can meet the requirements of vehicle steering stability and trajectory following.",

      "abstract": "Most works of image captioning are implemented under the full supervision of paired image-caption data. Limited to expensive cost of data collection, the task of unpaired image captioning has attracted researchers' attention. In this article, we propose a novel memorial GAN (MemGAN) with the joint semantic optimization for unpaired image captioning. The core idea is to explore implicit semantic correlation between disjointed images and sentences through building a multimodal semantic-aware space (SAS). Concretely, each modality is mapped into a unified multimodal SAS, where SAS includes the semantic vectors of image I , visual concepts O , unpaired sentence S , and the generated caption C . We adopt the memory unit based on multihead attention and relational gate as a backbone to preserve and transit crucial multimodal semantics in the SAS for image caption generation and sentence reconstruction. Then, the memory unit is embedded into a GAN framework to exploit the semantic similarity and relevance in SAS, that is, imposing a joint semantic-aware optimization on SAS without supervision clues. To summarize, the proposed MemGAN learns the latent semantic relevance of SAS's multimodalities in an adversarial manner. Extensive experiments and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGAN, achieving improvements over state of the arts on unpaired image captioning benchmarks.",

With existing terminology and iterative computing framework, this method can extract high-quality domain terms from a given domain-specific corpus. Experiments on geographic corpus show that mining results of this method are more accurate compared with that of the traditional unsupervised mining method, with an accuracy of 68.6% in the top 500 candidates. Meanwhile, the scoring system is more reasonable and effective. In general, this new word mining method can effectively utilize external knowledge and save costs of manual labeling. It is more practical and important to the construction and expansion of the glossary.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised image captioning with no annotations is an emerging challenge in computer vision, where the existing arts usually adopt GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) models. In this paper, we propose a novel memory-based network rather than GAN, named Recurrent Relational Memory Network (R2M). Unlike complicated and sensitive adversarial learning that non-ideally performs for long sentence generation, R2M implements a concepts-to-sentence memory translator through two-stage memory mechanisms: fusion and recurrent memories, correlating the relational reasoning between common visual concepts and the generated words for long periods. R2M encodes visual context through unsupervised training on images, while enabling the memory to learn from irrelevant textual corpus via supervised fashion. Our solution enjoys less learnable parameters and higher computational efficiency than GAN-based methods, which heavily bear parameter sensitivity. We experimentally validate the superiority of R2M than state-of-the-arts on all benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Compared with laborious pixel-wise dense labeling, it is much easier to label data by scribbles, which only costs 1~2 seconds to label one image. However, using scribble labels to learn salient object detection has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised salient object detection model to learn saliency from such annotations. In doing so, we first relabel an existing large-scale salient object detection dataset with scribbles, namely S-DUTS dataset. Since object structure and detail information is not identified by scribbles, directly training with scribble labels will lead to saliency maps of poor boundary localization. To mitigate this problem, we propose an auxiliary edge detection task to localize object edges explicitly, and a gated structure-aware loss to place constraints on the scope of structure to be recovered. Moreover, we design a scribble boosting scheme to iteratively consolidate our scribble annotations, which are then employed as supervision to learn high-quality saliency maps. As existing saliency evaluation metrics neglect to measure structure alignment of the predictions, the saliency map ranking may not comply with human perception. We present a new metric, termed saliency structure measure, as a complementary metric to evaluate sharpness of the prediction. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing weakly-supervised/unsupervised methods, but also is on par with several fully-supervised state-of-the-art models (Our code and data is publicly available at: https://github.com/JingZhang617/Scribble_Saliency).",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic around the world. With the explosive growth of confirmed cases, emergency medical supplies are facing global shortage, which restricts the treatment of seriously ill patients and protection of medical staff. Taking China, the United States, Australia, and Canada as examples, this study compares and analyzes the reserve and supply systems of emergency medical supplies and problems exposed in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Some common problems were found, such as insufficient types and quantities of emergency medical supplies in reserve, insufficient emergency production capacity, and imperfect command mechanism for emergency supplies deployment and transportation. A sound reserve system of emergency medical supplies is the basis and guarantee for dealing with public health emergencies such as major outbreaks. Based on the comparison of systems and practical experience, countries around the world should further improve the reserve and supply system of emergency medical supplies, and improve the coordination and cooperation mechanism for emergency supplies for international public health emergencies, so as to cope with increasingly severe public health emergencies in the context of globalization.",

We design a Parallel Temporal Encoder (PTEnc) to learn the temporal relation of a sign video from local and global sequential learning views in parallel. PTEnc utilizes the complementarity between the local and global temporal cues. Then, fused encoded feature sequence is fed into a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based sentence decoder. In addition, in order to enhance the temporal cues in each video, we introduce a reconstruction loss, which performs in an unsupervised way without additional labels. The CTC loss cooperates with the reconstruction loss in an end-to-end training manner. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "As the super-aged society, Japan is facing challenges in health care system. As one of measures to cope with challenges, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare started to construct an open medical information platform, named PeOPLe, in 2016 for personalized medical care, improvement of medical services, and the redistribution of medical resources. The Ministry plans to build the platform infrastructure by 2020 and put the platform into full-scale operation by 2025. PeOPLe collects only medical records, but it should collect lifelogs as well in order to better improve the health, especially for elderly. A lifelog is a record of a person's activity and it has potential to predict the probability a person will suffer a lifestyle-related disease as a result of the person's lifestyle. This prediction could help to maintain the health of the elderly. In addition, constructing a self-recording platform integrated with the medical platform is the best way to collect lifelogs since collecting a large amount of lifelogs for a long time from various people at public or medical agencies is difficult. A self-recording platform is a place where people can post and manage their lifelogs. In return for posting lifelogs, people will receive personalized health advice, which will attract more people.",

      "abstract": "Welding defect constitute a great danger to the safe usage of petroleum pipelines. In addition, manual welding defect detection has numerous deficiencies, such as subjectivity and inaccurate estimation of geometric parameters. Thus, we proposed an automatic welding defect detection system for X-ray images. In the system, five typical defects (cracks, lack of penetration, lack of fusion, round defects, and stripy defects) and non-defects were chosen for recognition. There are three stages in the system: defect extraction, defect detection, and defect recognition. In the first stage, background subtraction with an adaptive thresholding method was adopted to identify the potential defects. In the second stage, to extract real defects from the massive number of potential defects, the adaptive cascade boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm was employed for binary classification. Grayscale features and geometric properties of the defects were extracted for the classification. In the third stage, the AdaBoost algorithm was extended for multi-classification. In the process of distinguishing defects from non-defects, a high detection rate is necessary. To ensure the high true positive rate (TPR) and the low false positive rate (FPR), we proposed the cascade AdaBoost algorithm with penalty term. The accuracy of the defect detection was 85.5%, and the TPR was 91.66%. Moreover, three comparison tests of support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF) were employed to validate the superiority of AdaBoost. The experimental results indicate that the proposed detection system can be effective for defect detection.",

      "abstract": "In addition to birth and death, migration is also an important factor that determines the level of population aging in different regions, especially under the current context of low fertility and low mortality in China. Drawing upon data from the fifth and sixth national population census of 287 prefecture-level cities in China, this study explored the spatial patterns of population aging and its trends from 2000 to 2010 in China. We further examined how the large-scale internal migration was related to the spatial differences and the changes of aging by using multivariate quantitative models. Findings showed that the percentage of elder cities (i.e. proportion of individuals aged 65 and above to total population is higher than 7%) increased from 50% to 90% in the total 287 cities within the decade. We also found that regional imbalances of population aging have changed since 2000 in China. The gap of aging level between East zone and the other three zones (i.e. West, Central, and North-east) has considerably narrowed down. In 2000, Eastern region had the greatest number (65) of and the largest proportion (74.7%) of elder cities among all four regions. By 2010, the proportion (87.4%) of elder cities in the eastern region was slightly lower than Central (91.4%), Western (88.2%) and North-east sectors (91.2%). Results from multivariate quantitative models showed that the regional differences of population aging appear to be affected much more by the large-scale internal migration with clear age selectivity and orientation preference than by the impact of fertility and mortality. Population aging is expected to continue in China, which will in turn exacerbate regional imbalances. Policies and implications are discussed to face the challenges that the divergent aging population may present in China.",

In this paper, we present a novel health care platform for elderly people and patients who need to be taken care. The platform consists of a walk-aid unit, medical apparatus for health monitoring, data storage unit and remote monitoring unit. The medical devices are used for the elderly or patients who are undergoing a rehabilitative treatment, to determine the body's vital physiological indexes like pulse rate, heart rate, blood pressure level, body temperature and the inertial navigation system (INS). The inertial navigation system (INS) is employed to capture people's abnormal action like tumble. The walk-aid platform is designed to enhance people's mobility and collect position information of the elderly in case of an emergency. It is also equipped with a camera to capture a picture of the elderly and the environment. The data storage unit can collect and store the data from the medical devices and the walk-aid unit. The remote monitoring unit like pad or smart phone can be connected with the platform to check the situation of users. And in turn, if an emergency situation happened, the server computer can also send a message to the mobile device. The case study shows that it is an efficient way to keep the user under observation.",

      "abstract": "For the universal phenomenon of the aero-engine connectors with the looseness fault, a single degree of freedom lumped mass model was established and a looseness fault model was introduced. The response of the system was obtained by numerical integration methods and the asynchronous response characteristics were analyzed. The experiments were conducted on the connectors with looseness clearance. It is found that the acceleration response of the mass block after noise reduction has up-down asymmetrical impact characteristics in the waveform, also the pseudo-critical subharmonic resonance and the pseudo-critical ultra-harmonic resonance appear in frequency spectrum. These characteristics are in agreement with the results of the numerical simulation, which can be identified as the characteristics of the looseness fault. The reason leading to the looseness characteristics is that the period of stiffness changes in the period of the rotating speed. When the changing period of stiffness is equivalent to the vibration period, frequency multiplication will appear and the natural frequency of the system will be excited at specific speeds. When the changing period of stiffness is equivalent to n times the vibration period, 1/n frequency division and frequency multiplication will appear and the natural frequency of the system will be excited at specific speeds.",

      "abstract": "The unprecedented rapid aging of the population is poised to become the next global public health challenge, as is apparent by the fact that 23.1% of the total global burden of disease is attributable to disorders in people aged 60 years and older. Aging of the population is the biggest driver of substantial increases in the prevalence of chronic conditions, and the prevalence of multi-morbidity is much higher in older age groups. This places a large burden on countries' health and long-term care systems. Many behavioral changes and public policy responses to aging of the population have been implemented to cope with these challenges. A system of \"aging in place\" has been implemented in some high-income countries in order to better provide coordinated and cost-effective health services for the elderly. This approach reduces institutional care while supporting home- or community-based care and other services. Advances in information and communications technology (ICT), assistive devices, medical diagnostics, and interventions offer many ways of more efficiently providing long-term care as part of aging in place. The use of big data on a web services platform in an effective collaborative system should promote systematic data gathering to integrate clinical and public health information systems to provide support across the continuum of care. However, the use of big data in collaborative system is a double-edged sword, as it also bring challenges for information sharing, standardized data gathering, and the security of personal information, that warrant full attention.",

In this paper, we investigate the BS power consumption in multiple-input single-output (MISO) Poisson-Voronoi tessellation (PVT) random cellular networks. Taking into account the inter-cell interference, the impact of the traffic demands of users and the spatial traffic intensity on the BS power consumption are jointly considered for MISO PVT random cellular networks. Furthermore, the power consumption required at the BS in a typical PVT cell is modeled through characteristic functions. Simulation results are employed to evaluate the BS power consumption and the performance of the random cellular networks.",
