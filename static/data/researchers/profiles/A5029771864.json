    "trend_summary": "Wenming Zheng's research centers on robust, generalizable, and clinically relevant affective computing—spanning signal processing, deep learning, and neuroscience. A dominant theme is overcoming domain shift across datasets, speakers, modalities, and populations (e.g., infants, elderly, ASD), achieved via advanced domain adaptation, transfer learning, and invariant representation learning. There is strong emphasis on physiological signals—especially EEG—with pioneering use of graph neural networks to model brain connectivity dynamics. Micro-expression recognition emerges as a signature niche, focusing on subtle, spontaneous, and real-world cues using magnification-aware, sparse, and uncertainty-aware architectures. Multimodality (audio-visual-physiological-fNIRS) and clinical translation (depression, autism, elderly mental health) are consistently integrated. Recent work increasingly incorporates privacy-preserving AI (federated learning), controllable generation (emotion intensity, voice conversion), and group-level/context-aware emotion modeling.",

      "abstract": "Speaker attributes (e. g., age, accent, and expression habits) are typically confused with emotional cues in the speech feature space, which can impair the emotional discriminability of speech features that are robust to speakers, thereby degrading the generalization of speech emotion recognition (SER). To overcome this issue, we propose a Generalizable Dynamic Domain Adaptation (GDDA) framework for learning speaker-invariant speech emotion representations. GDDA transforms the speaker-independent SER task into an extension of domain adaptation from a single-source domain to multi-source domains to address the impact of multiple speakers on speech emotion representations. For this purpose, we first construct a GDDA under the <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</u>ingle <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</u>ource domain adaptation (i. e., GDDA-SS), which consists of two parts: a joint distribution adaptation (JDA) measuring the speech emotion feature distributions caused by speakers between the training and testing domains, and a dynamic balance factor (DBF) that enables the recognition model to adaptively handle unseen speaker data distributions. Specifically, JDA combines global marginal distribution adaptation (MDA) with local class-aware conditional distribution adaptation (CDA), and DBF uses <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {A}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-divergence to automatically quantify the contributions of MDA and CDA in JDA. In DJDA-SS, the training and testing data are considered as a source domain and a target domain, respectively, from a coarse-grained perspective. Considering the multi-domain property of speech emotion features from diverse speakers (i. e., each speaker can be regarded as a sub-domain), we further extend GDDA-SS to a <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</u>ulti-<underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</u>ource domain adaptation (i. e., GDDA-MS) to eliminate distribution shift from a fine-grained perspective. In contrast to GDDA-SS, it is implemented by calculating JDA and DBF under the multi-source domain adaptation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets (i. e., IEMOCAP, EMO-DB, CASIA, and MSP-Podcast) demonstrate that our GDDA framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions and have significant applications in fields such as psychology, security, and human-computer interaction. However, previous ME datasets are mainly collected in controlled laboratory environments, such as fixed views, single illumination and head movements, limited subjects and the lack of background. There are significant gaps between them and the real world. To handle this issue, we introduce a novel Natural Micro-Expression (NaME) dataset, a natural dataset collected under unconstrained real-world conditions. It encompasses (1) diverse subjects, multiple views and varying head movements ; (2) rich background information, providing a more realistic benchmark for the micro-expression recognition (MER) research. Furthermore, we propose a MER benchmark for natural environments, named MixFormer. MixFormer includes an efficient sparse attention mechanism to capture subtle facial motions from various factors, and a face-background mix of attention module to model the environment context to help MER. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze our NaME dataset and benchmark. We believe that our dataset and benchmark will pave the way for future research in MER beyond controlled settings, facilitating the deployment of MER in practical applications. NaME is available at github.com/real-ljt/NAMEdataset.",

      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and severe psychiatric disorder, and its detection remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of its symptoms. Traditional single-modality methods often fail to capture the full spectrum of depressive cues, which has led to the rise of multimodal methods. The ACM Multimedia 2025 ''Multimodal Personality-Aware Depression Detection Challenge'' (MPDD 2025) aims to advance the development of more accurate depression detection models by incorporating multimodal data. In this paper, we proposed a Multi-Level Segment Fusion Based on Adaptive Time-Window Selection (MSF-ATS) method for the MPDD-Elderly Track. To address the challenge of sparse and transient depressive symptoms, we fuse segment-level classifications to obtain subject-level classifications. An adaptive time-window selection based on mean class variance is employed to choose the window with the smallest variance for more stable detection results. Our method achieved an average score of 0.8576 on the MPDD 2025 official test set, significantly outperforming the baseline score of 0.6675.",

      "abstract": "Asynchronous Video Interviews (AVIs) allow candidates to record responses to predefined questions using digital devices, offering both flexibility and remote accessibility. Assessing personality traits and interview performance via AVIs provides organizations with valuable insights into candidate profiles and facilitates the prediction of future job performance. However, prior benchmark challenges, whose datasets were predominantly sourced from social media, suffer from suboptimal construct and methodological validity, limiting their utility for model development and real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce the AVI Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia 2025, featuring a novel dataset of mock AVIs comprising 3,876 videos from 646 participants in a simulated job application procedure. Interview questions were carefully designed to reflect real-world selection contexts and elicit personality expressions grounded in Trait Activation Theory. Personality traits and job competencies were annotated by trained evaluators and professional recruiters, ensuring both methodological rigor and ecological validity. The solutions and algorithms developed in this challenge are analyzed and summarized in this paper to foster the development of fair, reliable, and AI-driven hiring assessments.",

Here, we propose a visual-like template diffusion method, named TDFold, to achieve accurate and highly efficient single-sequence 3D structure prediction for proteins. Given a protein sequence, TDFold initially generates high-quality inter-residue geometries (distances and orientations) as templates from a probabilistic diffusion perspective. Since inter-residue geometries can be encoded as multi-channel feature matrices (each channel for either the inter-residue distance or orientation correlation), analogous to image features, we construct an image-level template diffusion module by adapting the stable diffusion (SD) model from text-vision generation to sequence-template diffusion for proteins. Subsequently, a lightweight sequence-template co-evolved learning (SCL) network is constructed to facilitate accurate and efficient protein structure prediction. As a result, TDFold possesses three highlights: (i) better single-sequence prediction performance: TDFold greatly outperforms existing protein language models (PLMs), including ESMFold (also known as ESM2), OmegaFold, trRosettaX-Single, and RGN2, on homology-insufficient datasets such as Orphan and Orphan25, while also achieving promising results on the popular CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks; (ii) low resource consumption: By utilizing the lightweight SCL architecture, the GPU memory consumption of TDFold is generally lower than that of popular methods such as AlphaFold2 and ESMFold; (iii) higher efficiency in training and inference: TDFold can be trained within a week using a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Furthermore, the inference time of TDFold is significantly shorter (about 10x to 100x) than that of existing methods (ESMFold and AlphaFold2) for long protein sequences. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging powerful vision diffusion models to enhance protein template generation, thereby establishing a new paradigm for single-sequence protein structure prediction. It also accelerates protein-related research, particularly for resource-limited universities and academic institutions. The code has been released to speed up biological research.",

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are gaining increasing popularity for EEG-based depression detection. However, previous GNN-based methods inadequately consider the characteristics of depression, which limit their performance. First, neuroscience studies indicate that patients with depression exhibit both common and individualized brain abnormalities. Previous GNN-based approaches typically focus either on common graph connections to capture common brain abnormalities or on individualized connections to capture individualized patterns, which is insufficient for depression detection. Second, brain network exhibits a hierarchical structure, ranging from channel-level graphs to region-level graphs. This hierarchical structure varies across individuals and contains significant information relevant to detecting depression. However, previous GNN-based methods overlook this individualized hierarchical information. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid GNN (HybGNN) that combines a Common Graph Neural Network (CGNN) branch using common connections and an Individualized Graph Neural Network (IGNN) branch employing individualized connections. The two branches capture common and individualized depression patterns, respectively, complementing each other. Furthermore, we enhance the HybGNN with a Cross-Branch Hierarchical Information Extractor (CB-HIE) to extract more task-relevant individualized hierarchical information. Extensive experiments on the MODMA and HUSM datasets demonstrate that the proposed HybGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamical causal graph neural network (DCGNN) based on the effective causal connectivity of brain function network for EEG emotion recognition, in which Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is used to find the optimal causal graph topology associated with the adjacent matrix of DCGNN. To this end, we firstly construct a skeleton graph using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and then use GES to optimize the directional graph topology of DCGNN. Then, learnable weight parameters associated with the adjacent matrix are learnt during the model training of DCGNN. Additionally, a sparse graphic constraint is employed to enhance the efficacy of emotion recognition, while a Conditional Domain Adversarial Network (CDAN) is used to integrate features with emotion labels for improving subjectindependent validation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on five public datasets, i.e., SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, MPED, and FACED, demonstrating that the proposed model surpasses recent causal based (Granger causality) and domain adaptation based GNN models across all experimental settings.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the research of micro-expression recognition (MER) and proposes a flexible and reliable deep learning method called learning to rank onset-occurring-offset representations (LTR3O). The LTR3O method introduces a dynamic and reduced-size sequence structure known as 3O, which consists of onset, occurring, and offset frames, for representing micro-expressions (MEs). This structure facilitates the subsequent learning of ME-discriminative features. A noteworthy advantage of the 3O structure is its flexibility, as the occurring frame is randomly extracted from the original ME sequence without the need for accurate frame spotting methods. Based on the 3O structures, LTR3O generates multiple 3O representation candidates for each ME sample and incorporates well-designed modules based on learning to rank (LTR) to measure and calibrate their emotional expressiveness. This calibration process implicitly enhances the visibility of MEs by amplifying the originally narrow emotional expressiveness gap among ME frames caused by their low-intensity characteristics, thereby facilitating the reliable learning of more discriminative features for MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of LTR3O using four widely-used ME databases: CASME II, SMIC, SAMM, and MEVIEW. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of LTR3O, particularly in terms of its flexibility and reliability, when compared to recent state-of-the-art MER methods.",

      "abstract": "As mobile devices and sensor technology advance, their role in communication becomes increasingly indispensable. Micro-expression recognition, an invaluable non-verbal communication method, has been extensively studied in human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and security fields. However, the sensitivity and privacy implications of micro-expression data pose significant challenges for centralized machine learning methods, raising concerns about serious privacy leakage and data sharing. To address these limitations, we investigate a federated learning scheme tailored specifically for this task. Our approach prioritizes user privacy by employing federated optimization techniques, enabling the aggregation of clients' knowledge in an encrypted space without compromising data privacy. By integrating established micro-expression recognition methods into our framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only ensures robust data protection but also maintains high recognition performance comparable to non-privacy-preserving mechanisms. To our knowledge, this marks the first application of federated learning to the micro-expression recognition task.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Accurately predicting protein structure, from sequences to 3D structures, is of great significance in biological research. To tackle this issue, a representative deep big model, RoseTTAFold, is proposed with promising success. Here, “a light‐weight deep graph network, named LightRoseTTA,” is reported to achieve accurate and highly efficient prediction for proteins. Notably, three highlights are possessed by LightRoseTTA: i) high‐accurate structure prediction for proteins, being “competitive with RoseTTAFold” on multiple popular datasets including CASP14 and CAMEO; ii) high‐efficient training and inference with a light‐weight model, costing “only 1 week on one single NVIDIA 3090 GPU for model‐training” (vs 30 days on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs for RoseTTAFold) and containing “only 1.4M parameters” (vs 130M in RoseTTAFold); iii) low dependency on multi‐sequence alignment (MSA), achieving the best performance on three MSA‐insufficient datasets: Orphan, De novo, and Orphan25. Besides, LightRoseTTA is “transferable” from general proteins to antibody data, as verified in the experiments. The time and resource costs of LightRoseTTA and RoseTTAFold are further discussed to demonstrate the feasibility of light‐weight models for protein structure prediction, which may be crucial in resource‐limited research for universities and academic institutions. The code and model are released to speed biological research ( https://github.com/psp3dcg/LightRoseTTA ).",

      "abstract": "Zero-shot Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) aims to transform a speaker’s emotional state to match a target emotion, even for speakers and emotion categories that were not encountered during training, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of traditional EVC systems. Despite advancements in the field, existing methods often face challenges in preserving speaker identity and ensuring the naturalness of emotional expression, particularly in the context of rhythm modeling. To this end, we propose the Zero-Shot Emotion Voice Conversion (ZSEVC) model, which leverages self-supervised learning for speaker adaptation and duration prediction. To adjust speech rhythm in alignment with the target emotional state, we introduce a rhythm-aware content encoder that captures and refines discrete speech units at a finer granularity. Additionally, a hierarchical emotion fusion scheme is employed to integrate emotional features with content features, enhancing both pronunciation accuracy and emotional expressiveness. Moreover, a residual speaker-emotion fusion module is incorporated to better adapt speaker characteristics to emotional prosodic variation. Experimental results show ZSEVC’s superior performance in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity in zero-shot scenario, successfully generating emotional speeches for unseen emotions and speakers. Speech samples are available at https://wosyoo.github.io/ZSEVC.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging multimodal brain signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), for the objective detection of brain activity is regarded as a promising approach for affective brain-computer interface. Existing EEG-fNIRS bimodal methods primarily focus on data alignment and basic feature fusion, neglecting the intrinsic connections between different signals and brain regions. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based method, the Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN), which integrates multimodal complementary information and constructs a heterogeneous EEG-fNIRS interaction graph within a coordinated hyperspace to model brain networks. Specifically, various directed edges types and node feature aggregation strategies are employed to dynamically update and enhance the representation of brain signals and emotional states, thereby improving the coherence and consistency of cross-modal signals. Furthermore, this approach provides a robust framework for exploring cross-modal spatial connectivity. In this paper, we also developed a novel EEG-fNIRS emotion database collected from 17 subjects by video stimuli. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method and the effectiveness of the introduced heterogeneous EEG-fNIRS interaction graph.",

      "abstract": "Group-level emotion recognition (GER) is an inseparable part of human behavior analysis, aiming to recognize an overall emotion in a multi-person scene. However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty, we adopt stochastic embedding sourced from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. It helps capture the probabilities of emotions and facilitates diverse inferences. Additionally, we adaptively assign uncertainty-sensitive scores as the fusion weights for individuals’ faces within a group. Moreover, we developed an image enhancement module to evaluate and filter samples, strengthening the model’s data-level robustness against uncertainties. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene components, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases.",

However, current algorithms lack methods for extracting interpretable acoustic features based on clinical manifestations. In addition, effectively fusing these features to overcome individual heterogeneity remains a challenge. This study proposes a decoupled multi-perspective fusion (DMPF) model. The model extracts five key features of voiceprint, emotion, pause, energy, and tremor based on the multi-perspective clinical manifestations. These features are then decoupled into common and private features, which fused through graph attention network to obtain the comprehensive depression representation. Notably, this study has collected a depression speech dataset, which includes standardized and comprehensive tasks along with diagnostic labels provided by psychologists. Extensive subject-independent experiments were conducted on the DAIC-WOZ, MODMA and MPSC datasets. The voiceprint features can automatically cluster the depressed and non-depressed populations. Furthermore, DMPF can effectively fuse common and private features from different perspectives, achieving AUC of 84.20%, 85.34%, 86.13% on three datasets. The results illustrate the interpretability of multi-perspective features and demonstrate that the combination of speech manifestations can enhance the detection ability, which can provide a multi-perspective observational tool for physicians and clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of current vision-based facial action unit (AU) detection approaches, they are heavily susceptible to the variations across different domains and the cross-domain AU detection methods are under-explored. In response to this challenge, we propose a decoupled doubly contrastive adaptation (D2CA) approach to learn a purified AU representation that is semantically aligned for the source and target domains. Specifically, we decompose latent representations into AU-relevant and AU-irrelevant components, with the objective of exclusively facilitating adaptation within the AU-relevant subspace. To achieve the feature decoupling, D2CA is trained to disentangle AU and domain factors by assessing the quality of synthesized faces in cross-domain scenarios when either AU or domain attributes are modified. To further strengthen feature decoupling, particularly in scenarios with limited AU data diversity, D2CA employs a doubly contrastive learning mechanism comprising image and feature-level contrastive learning to ensure the quality of synthesized faces and mitigate feature ambiguities. This new framework leads to an automatically learned, dedicated separation of AU-relevant and domain-relevant factors, and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the cross-domain facial image synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of D2CA in successfully decoupling AU and domain factors, yielding visually pleasing cross-domain synthesized facial images. Meanwhile, D2CA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain AU detection approaches, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 6%-14% across various cross-domain scenarios.",

Unlike existing methods that adopt a coarse-grained approach to model interactions among all individuals, our approach adaptively identifies and emphasizes key individuals who play a crucial role in conveying group-level emotions. By integrating coarse-grained relationship modeling with fine-grained key individual enhancement and leveraging global scene information, our method effectively refines discriminative feature generation while minimizing irrelevant interference. We introduce a Multi-branch Interaction Module (MIM) to dynamically fuse features from both the global scene and local individual branches using a localized mask integration strategy. This comprehensive approach enhances the interaction between global and local features, resulting in robust group-level emotion representations. Extensive experiments on three widely adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in various real-world scenarios. Methods that integrate visual and audio modalities have become increasingly prominent because of their superior information-carrying capacity and complementarity. Despite advancements in feature fusion between video and audio, existing modality fusion-based methods struggle to effectively address the dynamic changes in feature quality caused by interference, which is common in emotion recognition in the wild tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Parameter-Free Feature Evaluation and Interaction (PFFEI) model based on information quality assessment. The model leverages the scaling factor γ of the normalization layer to evaluate information quality and dynamically adjusts the degree of interaction between modalities, suppressing the impact of low-quality features affected by interference. Additionally, the norm constraint integrated into the model ensures that the γ value consistently measures feature quality across different modalities. This approach effectively mitigates the effects of modality imbalance and significantly enhances the model’s accuracy. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experiments on three challenging real-world emotion datasets: DFEW, AFEW, and Ekman6. The results show that the PFFEI model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements of 8.71% (UAR) and 8.61% (WAR) on the AFEW database.",

      "abstract": "One challenge in facial action unit detection lies in the variability of facial attributes across individuals. This variability leads to diminished performance of existing AU detection methods on unseen facial identities. The primary reason for this is that the AU representations, as acquired by these methods, are closely entangled with facial identities in the training data. Consequently, the detection model tends to learn identity-specific features, which are not exclusively related to AUs. To alleviate the entanglement problem, we propose a facial geometric decoupling method inspired by 3D Morphable Model. Our approach consists of a Texture Learning (TL) module for extracting AU-related textural features, a Geometry Learning (GL) module for identity-independent geometric features via decoupling losses, and a Feature Fusion (FF) module. FF module is used to capture the interrelationship between 2D textural and 3D geometric features, then it further learns the relationship between AUs through a graph neural network. We evaluated our model on the DISFA and BP4D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art F1 scores. In addition, compared to existing methods that do not explicitly learn identity-independent features, our method maintains effectiveness on DISFA dataset with fewer facial identities, showing that our method is capable of learning more generalized AU detection features.",

      "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) is crucial for human–computer interaction (HCI), yet remains a challenge in cross-domain scenarios. Emotional expressions vary significantly across speakers, languages, and recording conditions, leading to serious domain shifts. Coupled subspace learning has recently attracted considerable attention in domain adaptation (DA) as an effective approach to mitigating domain discrepancies by capturing common and domain-specific information. However, existing algorithms suffer from two limitations: 1) most methods directly adopt classifiers [e.g., support vector machine (SVM)] to incorporate discriminative information of the target domain, but such strategies lack flexibility and adaptability; and 2) the features learned from coupled projection matrices are redundant and poorly discriminative. To address these issues, we propose a novel DA approach named coupled sparse subspace alignment (CSSA) for cross-domain SER. Specifically, CSSA first performs latent representation learning on the unlabeled target domain data, in which the latent representation matrix is then optimized into a pseudolabel matrix to provide emotional guidance. Meanwhile, it models the source and target domains separately by sparse regression, thereby learning both discriminative and domain-specific information. Subsequently, CSSA performs coupled subspace alignment to reduce the domain discrepancy, where the dual projection matrices are progressively aligned to enhance their similarity. Additionally, a graph Laplacian regularization is applied to the cross-domain data to capture the local geometric structure. Extensive experiments on five public SER datasets demonstrate the superiority of CSSA over state-of-the-art DA methods.",

      "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signals offer high information transfer rates and non-invasive brain-to-device connectivity, making them highly practical. In recent years, deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, have gained prominence in EEG (e.g., SSVEP) decoding because of their nonlinear modeling capabilities and autonomy from manual feature extraction. However, most studies using CNNs employ temporal signals as the input and cannot directly mine the implicit frequency information, which may cause crucial frequency details to be lost and challenges in decoding. By contrast, the prevailing supervised recognition algorithms rely on a lengthy calibration phase to enhance algorithm performance, which could impede the popularization of SSVEP based BCIs. To address these problems, this study proposes the Time-Frequency Attention Network (TFA-Net), a novel CNN model tailored for SSVEP signal decoding without the calibration phase. Additionally, we introduce the Frequency Attention and Channel Recombination modules to enhance ability of TFA-Net to infer finer frequency-wise attention and extract features efficiently from SSVEP in the time-frequency domain. Classification results on a public dataset demonstrated that the proposed TFA-Net outperforms all the compared models, achieving an accuracy of 79.00% $\\pm$ 0.27% and information transfer rate of 138.82 $\\pm$ 0.78 bits/min with a 1-s data length. TFA-Net represents a novel approach to SSVEP identification as well as time-frequency signal analysis, offering a calibration-free solution that enhances the generalizability and practicality of SSVEP based BCIs.",

      "abstract": "Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) poses a challenge due to feature distribution mismatch between the training and testing speech samples, potentially degrading the performance of established SER methods. In this article, we tackle this challenge by proposing a novel transfer subspace learning method called acoustic knowledge-guided transfer linear regression (AKTLR). Unlike existing approaches, which often overlook domain-specific knowledge related to SER and simply treat cross-corpus SER as a generic transfer learning task, our AKTLR method is built upon a well-designed acoustic knowledge-guided dual sparsity constraint mechanism. This mechanism emphasizes the potential of minimalistic acoustic parameter feature sets to alleviate classifier over-adaptation, which is empirically validated acoustic knowledge in SER, enabling superior generalization in cross-corpus SER tasks compared to using large feature sets. Through this mechanism, we extend a simple transfer linear regression model to AKTLR. This extension harnesses its full capability to seek emotion-discriminative and corpus-invariant features from established acoustic parameter feature sets used for describing speech signals across two scales: contributive acoustic parameter groups and constituent elements within each contributive group. We evaluate our method through extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on three widely used speech emotion corpora: EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA. The proposed AKTLR achieves an average UAR of 42.12% across six tasks using the eGeMAPS feature set, outperforming many recent state-of-the-art transfer subspace learning and deep transfer learning methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of our approach. Furthermore, our work provides experimental evidence supporting the feasibility and superiority of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the transfer learning model to address cross-corpus SER tasks.",

Existing transfer subspace learning and regression-based SER methods have the following drawbacks. The features in the subspace are still insufficiently representative and discriminative, and direct regression would lead to information loss. To address these problems, we present a novel common discriminative latent space learning (CDLSL) method for cross-domain SER. To be specific, we first obtain a common latent space by imposing a projection matrix on the cross-domain data. Meanwhile, we impose an uncorrelated constraint on the projection matrix to ensure that the features are representative and discriminative after dimension reduction. Then, we implement a graph regularization term on the latent representations of the samples to capture the local similarity information. Furthermore, to obtain a more discriminative common latent space, we introduce the label information by aligning the latent space with the relaxed label space, while mitigating the information loss for regression. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art competitors.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep inductive transfer learning framework, named feature distribution adaptation network, to tackle the challenging multi-modal speech emotion recognition problem. Our method aims to use deep transfer learning strategies to align visual and audio feature distributions to obtain consistent representation of emotion, thereby improving the performance of speech emotion recognition. In our model, the pre-trained ResNet-34 is utilized for feature extraction for facial expression images and acoustic Mel spectrograms, respectively. Then, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to model the intrinsic similarity relationships of multi-modal features. Finally, the multi-modal feature distribution adaptation is performed efficiently with feed-forward network, which is extended using the local maximum mean discrepancy loss. Experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve excellent performance compared with existing ones.",

      "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is a commonly used brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm. The performance of cross-subject SSVEP classification has a strong impact on SSVEP-BCI. This study designed a cross subject generalization SSVEP classification model based on an improved transformer structure that uses domain generalization (DG). The global receptive field of multi-head self-attention is used to learn the global generalized SSVEP temporal information across subjects. This is combined with a parallel local convolution module, designed to avoid oversmoothing the oscillation characteristics of temporal SSVEP data and better fit the feature. Moreover, to improve the cross-subject calibration-free SSVEP classification performance, an DG method named StableNet is combined with the proposed convolutional transformer structure to form the DG-Conformer method, which can eliminate spurious correlations between SSVEP discriminative information and background noise to improve cross-subject generalization. Experiments on two public datasets, Benchmark and BETA, demonstrated the outstanding performance of the proposed DG-Conformer compared with other calibration-free methods, FBCCA, tt-CCA, Compact-CNN, FB-tCNN, and SSVEPNet. Additionally, DG-Conformer outperforms the classic calibration-required algorithms eCCA, eTRCA and eSSCOR when calibration is used. An incomplete partial stimulus calibration scheme was also explored on the Benchmark dataset, and it was demonstrated to be a potential solution for further high-performance personalized SSVEP-BCI with quick calibration.",

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) is a highly challenging task, which relies on the initial frame’s mask as a segmentation reference in a video sequence to classify each pixel in subsequent frames. However, the guidance provided by the first frame is limited due to the diverse types of segmentation targets and uncertain appearance changes. Consequently, it is crucial to retain useful information during the segmentation process and employ this information for model iteration optimization, enabling the model to better adapt to rapidly changing segmentation objectives. In this work, we propose a multi-scale adaptive model optimization strategy, which incorporates a contextual relevance enhancement module to enforce object correlation by emphasizing feature similarity across adjacent frames. Additionally, we introduce a keyframe discrimination module to deal with the segmentation challenges in scenarios involving significant target changes. Moreover, we also introduce a multi-scale memory screening module to automatically screen and select global-local optimization features for ensuring the model’s generalization performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS and large-scale Youtube-VOS 2018/2019 datasets without relying on synthetic training data or first-frame fine-tuning.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, group-level emotion recognition (GER) has emerged as an important area in analyzing human behavior. Early GER methods are primarily relied on handcrafted features. However, with the proliferation of Deep Learning (DL) techniques and their remarkable success in diverse tasks, neural networks have garnered increasing interest in GER. Unlike individual's emotion, group emotions exhibit diversity and dynamics. Presently, several DL approaches have been proposed to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in group-level image and enhance GER performance significantly. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of DL techniques applied to GER, proposing a new taxonomy for the field cover all aspects of GER based on DL. The survey overviews datasets, the deep GER pipeline, and performance comparisons of the state-of-the-art methods past decade. Moreover, it summarizes and discuss the fundamental approaches and advanced developments for each aspect. Furthermore, we identify outstanding challenges and suggest potential avenues for the design of robust GER systems. To the best of our knowledge, thus survey represents the first comprehensive review of deep GER methods, serving as a pivotal references for future GER research endeavors.",

      "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) have a broad application prospect owing to their multiple command output and high performance. Each harmonic component of SSVEP individually contains unique features, which can be utilized to enhance the recognition performance of SSVEP-based BCIs. However, the existing subband analysis methods for SSVEP, including those based on filter banks and existing mode decomposition methods, have limitations in extracting and utilizing independent harmonic components. This study proposes a sinusoidal signal assisted multivariate variational mode decomposition (SA-MVMD) algorithm that allows the constraint of the center frequencies and narrowband filtering structures of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the prior frequency knowledge of the signal. It preserves the target information of the signal during decomposition while avoiding mode mixing and incorrect decomposition, thereby enabling the effective extraction of each independent harmonic component of SSVEP. Building on this, a SA-MVMD based task-related component analysis (SA-MVMD-TRCA) method is further proposed to fully utilize the features within the overall SSVEP as well as its independent harmonics, thereby enhancing the recognition performance. Testing on the public SSVEP Benchmark dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms the filter bank-based control methods. This study confirms the effectiveness of SA-MVMD and the potential of this approach, which analyzes and utilizes each independent harmonic of SSVEP, providing new strategies and perspectives for performance enhancement in SSVEP-based BCIs.",

      "abstract": "The emotion recognition has attracted more attention in recent decades. Although significant progress has been made in the recognition technology of the seven basic emotions, existing methods are still hard to tackle compound emotion recognition that occurred commonly in practical application. This article introduces our achievements in the 7th Field Emotion Behavior Analysis (ABAW) competition. In the competition, we selected pre trained ResNet18 and Transformer, which have been widely validated, as the basic network framework. Considering the continuity of emotions over time, we propose a time pyramid structure network for frame level emotion prediction. Furthermore. At the same time, in order to address the lack of data in composite emotion recognition, we utilized fine-grained labels from the DFEW database to construct training data for emotion categories in competitions. Taking into account the characteristics of valence arousal of various complex emotions, we constructed a classification framework from coarse to fine in the label space.",

      "abstract": "Reconstructing missing modality based on available modalities is widely used to address inevitable modality-missing for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER). However, due to explicit distribution gap across heterogeneous modalities, they fail to guarantee the consistency between the reconstructed data and the ground truth. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel method to restore the missing modality using its weighted prototypes rather than other modalities. Specifically, prototypes of different classes of missing modality are used to encapsulate its representative knowledge. Then sample-to-prototype affinity measuring class similarity is used as weights to combine these prototypes for reconstruction, thereby effectively restoring the distribution-consistent modality. Furthermore, to improve the efficacy of prototype-based completion under seriously missing, we devise an adaptive knowledge distillation from the strong modality to the weaker ones. This reinforces the representation ability of weak modality features. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has considerable significance in areas such as disease diagnosis and emotion analysis. Recent rPPG models have demonstrated excellent performance due to their powerful heart rate information extraction capabilities. However, these models often focus on limited regions of interest (ROI) on facial image, which makes them sensitive to interference. If the ROI is affected by muscle movement, lighting variation and noise, the model’s performance would degrade significantly. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage model called MaskFusionNet. The model includes two stages: 1) During the pre-training stage, the mask-reconstruction mechanism drives MaskFusionNet to learn rPPG information from various facial regions by applying a tube masking strategy. This enhances the model’s ability to resist interference. Based on the periodicity and continuity of the heart rate signal, we also design a novel spatio-temporal reconstruction loss function that focuses on the data’s spatial features and temporal continuity. 2) In the fine-tuning stage, we propose the Multi-Scale Fusion Block (MFB) to combine multi-scale features from the dual-stream network. It allows the model to detect subtle heart rate variations in adjacent frames while minimizing the impact of interference by extracting features within longer segments. The transformer-based MaskFusionNet can extract multi-scale fused heart rate features from a wide range of skin regions while preserving the modeling capability of long-range sequence information. To validate its effectiveness, we extensively evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets (VIPL-HR, COHFACE, and PURE), demonstrating its superior performance in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The aim of multi-speaker emotional speech synthesis is to generate speech for a designated speaker in a desired emotional state. The task is challenging due to the presence of speech variations, such as noise, content, and timbre, which can obstruct emotion extraction and transfer. This paper proposes a new approach to performing multi-speaker emotional speech synthesis. The proposed method, which is based on a seq2seq synthesizer, integrates emotion embedding as a conditioned variable to convey exact emotional information from reference audio to the synthesized speech. To boost emotion representation capability, we utilize a three-dimensional acoustic feature as input. And an emotion generalization module with adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) is proposed to obtain emotion embedding with high generalization ability, which also results in improved controllability. The derived emotion embedding from the generalization module can be readily conditioned by affine parameters, allowing for control both the emotion category and the emotion intensity of synthesized speech. Various emotional speech synthesis experimental results of the propposed method demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in multi-speaker emotional speech synthesis, coupled with its advantage of high emotion controllability.",

      "abstract": "Mining discriminative graph topological information plays an important role in promoting graph representation ability. However, it suffers from two main issues: (1) the difficulty/complexity of computing global inter-class/intra-class scatters, commonly related to mean and covariance of graph samples, for discriminant learning; (2) the huge complexity and variety of graph topological structure that is rather challenging to robustly characterize. In this paper, we propose the Wasserstein Discriminant Dictionary Learning (WDDL) framework to achieve discriminant learning on graphs with robust graph topology modeling, and hence facilitate graph-based pattern analysis tasks. Considering the difficulty of calculating global inter-class/intra-class scatters, a reference set of graphs (aka graph dictionary) is first constructed by generating representative graph samples (aka graph keys) with expressive topological structure. Then, a Wasserstein Graph Representation (WGR) process is proposed to project input graphs into a succinct dictionary space through the graph dictionary lookup. To further achieve discriminant graph learning, a Wasserstein discriminant loss (WD-loss) is defined on the graph dictionary, in which the graph keys are optimizable, to make the intra-class keys more compact and inter-class keys more dispersed. Hence, the calculation of global Wasserstein metric (W-metric) centers can be bypassed. For sophisticated topology mining in the WGR process, a joint-Wasserstein graph embedding module is constructed to model both between-node and between-edge relationships across inputs and graph keys by encapsulating both the Wasserstein metric (between cross-graph nodes) and proposed novel Kron-Gromov-Wasserstein (KGW) metric (between cross-graph adjacencies). Specifically, the KGW-metric comprehensively characterizes the cross-graph connection patterns with the Kronecker operation, then adaptively captures those salient patterns through connection pooling. To evaluate the proposed framework, we study two graph-based pattern analysis problems, i.e. graph classification and cross-modal retrieval, with the graph dictionary flexibly adjusted to cater to these two tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to comprehensively compare with existing advanced methods, as well as dissect the critical component of our proposed architecture. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the WDDL framework.",

      "abstract": "Most of the work on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition aims to extract the distinguishing features from high-dimensional EEG signals, ignoring the complementarity of information between EEG latent space and graph space. Furthermore, the influence of brain connectivity on emotions encompasses both physical structure and functional connectivity, which may have varying degrees of importance for different individuals. To address these issues, this article introduces an adaptive dual-space network (ADS-Net) with multigraph fusion aimed at capturing more comprehensive information by integrating dual-space representations. Specifically, ADS-Net models the spatial correlation of EEG channels in graph topological space, while exploring long-range dependencies and frequency relationships from EEG data in latent space. Subsequently, these representations are adaptively combined through an innovative gated fusion approach to extract complementary corepresentations. Moreover, drawing on the principles of brain connectivity theory, the proposed method constructs a multigraph to indicate the associativity of EEG channels. To further capture individual differences, an adaptive multigraph fusion mechanism is developed for the dynamic integration of physical and functional connectivity graphs. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, the superior experimental results underscore the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale 3D-CRU model, with the goal of extracting more discriminative emotion feature from EEG signals. By concurrently exploiting the relative electrode locations and different frequency subbands of EEG signals, a three-dimensional feature representation is reconstructed wherein the Delta ( δ ) frequency pattern is included. We employ a multi-scale approach, termed 3D-CRU, to concurrently extract frequency and spatial features at varying levels of granularity within each time segment. In the proposed 3D-CRU, we introduce a multi-scale 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) to effectively capture discriminative information embedded within the 3D feature representation. To model the temporal dynamics across consecutive time segments, we incorporate a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module to extract temporal representations from the time series of combined frequency-spatial features. Ultimately, the 3D-CRU model yields a global feature representation, encompassing comprehensive information across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Numerous experimental assessments conducted on publicly available DEAP and SEED databases provide empirical evidence supporting the enhanced performance of our proposed model in the domain of emotion recognition. These findings underscore the efficacy of the features extracted by the proposed multi-scale 3D-GRU model, particularly with the incorporation of the Delta ( δ ) frequency pattern. Specifically, on the DEAP dataset, the accuracy of Valence and Arousal are 93.12% and 94.31%, respectively, while on the SEED dataset, the accuracy is 92.25%.",

      "abstract": "Subspace learning-based methods have shown excellent performance for multi-view clustering, yet have the following problems: (1) most existing methods obtain the subspace representation from the original space, which might contain noises and cannot guarantee a clean enough subspace representation; (2) existing methods mainly focus on the consistency of the subspace representation, while the unique information of each view is not sufficiently exploited. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering method called comprehensive multi-view self-representations (CMSR). Specifically, we learn the original coefficient matrix of each view through the self-representation, which can reduce the noise of the original space to some extent. Then, we learn the subspace representation of the original coefficient matrix and decompose it into a consistent coefficient matrix and multiple diverse coefficient matrices, which can exploit the consistent and complementary information of multi-view data. Further, we impose the Schatten p-norm constraint on the consistent coefficient matrix to capture robust consistent information. Finally, the comprehensive results on eight real datasets demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) method called layer-adapted implicit distribution alignment networks (LIDANs) to address the challenge of cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER). LIDAN extends our previous ICASSP work, deep implicit distribution alignment networks (DIDANs), whose key contribution lies in the introduction of a novel regularization term called implicit distribution alignment (IDA). This term allows DIDAN trained on source (training) speech samples to remain applicable to predicting emotion labels for target (testing) speech samples, regardless of corpus variance in cross-corpus SER. To further enhance this method, we extend IDA to layer-adapted IDA (LIDA), resulting in LIDAN. This layer-adapted extension consists of three modified IDA terms that consider emotion labels at different levels of granularity. These terms are strategically arranged within different fully connected layers in LIDAN, aligning with the increasing emotion-discriminative abilities with respect to the layer depth. This arrangement enables LIDAN to more effectively learn emotion-discriminative and corpus-invariant features for SER across various corpora compared to DIDAN. It is also worthy to mention that unlike most existing methods that rely on estimating statistical moments to describe preassumed explicit distributions, both IDA and LIDA take a different approach. They utilize an idea of target sample reconstruction to directly bridge the feature distribution gap without making assumptions about their distribution type. As a result, DIDAN and LIDAN can be viewed as implicit cross-corpus SER methods. To evaluate LIDAN, we conducted extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA corpora. The experimental results demonstrate that LIDAN surpasses recent state-of-theart explicit unsupervised DA methods in tackling cross-corpus SER tasks.",

To improve the content naturalness of converted audio, we have developed an end-to-end EVC architecture inspired by the high audio quality of VITS. By seamlessly integrating an acoustic converter and vocoder, we effectively address the common issue of mismatch between emotional prosody training and run-time conversion that is prevalent in existing EVC models. To further enhance the emotional naturalness, we introduce an emotion descriptor to model the subtle prosody variations of different speech emotions. Additionally, we propose a prosody predictor, which predicts prosody features from text based on the provided emotion label. Notably, we introduce a prosody alignment loss to establish a connection between latent prosody features from two distinct modalities, ensuring effective training. Experimental results show that the performance of PAVITS is superior to the state-of-the-art EVC methods. Speech Samples are available at https://jeremychee4.github.io/pavits4EVC/.",

      "abstract": "Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) aims to transfer emotional knowledge from a labeled source corpus to an unlabeled corpus. However, prior methods require access to source data during adaptation, which is unattainable in real-life scenarios due to data privacy protection concerns. This paper tackles a more practical task, namely source-free cross-corpus SER, where a pre-trained source model is adapted to the target domain without access to source data. To address the problem, we propose a novel method called emotion-aware contrastive adaptation network (ECAN). The core idea is to capture local neighborhood information between samples while considering the global class-level adaptation. Specifically, we propose a nearest neighbor contrastive learning to promote local emotion consistency among features of highly similar samples. Furthermore, relying solely on nearest neighborhoods may lead to ambiguous boundaries between clusters. Thus, we incorporate supervised contrastive learning to encourage greater separation between clusters representing different emotions, thereby facilitating improved class-level adaptation. Extensive experiments indicate that our proposed ECAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the source-free cross-corpus SER setting on several speech emotion corpora.",

      "abstract": "Swin-Transformer has demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision by leveraging its hierarchical feature representation based on Transformer. In speech signals, emotional information is distributed across different scales of speech features, e. g., word, phrase, and utterance. Drawing above inspiration, this paper presents a hierarchical speech Transformer with shifted windows to aggregate multi-scale emotion features for speech emotion recognition (SER), called Speech Swin-Transformer. Specifically, we first divide the speech spectrogram into segment-level patches in the time domain, composed of multiple frame patches. These segment-level patches are then encoded using a stack of Swin blocks, in which a local window Transformer is utilized to explore local inter-frame emotional information across frame patches of each segment patch. After that, we also design a shifted window Transformer to compensate for patch correlations near the boundaries of segment patches. Finally, we employ a patch merging operation to aggregate segment-level emotional features for hierarchical speech representation by expanding the receptive field of Transformer from frame-level to segment-level. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Speech Swin-Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

Consequently, when the trained model is confronted with data from new speakers, its performance tends to degrade. To address the issue, we propose a Dynamic Joint Distribution Adaptation (DJDA) method under the framework of multi-source domain adaptation. DJDA firstly utilizes joint distribution adaptation (JDA), involving marginal distribution adaptation (MDA) and conditional distribution adaptation (CDA), to more precisely measure the multi-domain distribution shifts caused by different speakers. This helps eliminate speaker bias in emotion features, allowing for learning discriminative and speaker-invariant speech emotion features from coarse-level to fine-level. Furthermore, we quantify the adaptation contributions of MDA and CDA within JDA by using a dynamic balance factor based on $\\mathcal{A}$-Distance, promoting to effectively handle the unknown distributions encountered in data from new speakers. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our DJDA as compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression (ME) recognition is challenging due to the low-intensity facial motions. An idea to overcome this is learning assisted by macro-expressions (MaEs). However, the intensity gap between MaE and ME is so huge that related works fail to effectively leverage MaE's assistance in overcoming low-intensity interference, which attempt to directly force ME knowledge to mimic MaE knowledge. In this paper, we propose that the knowledge transfer from MaE to ME can be converted into a progressive process for better implementation. Thus, we construct a progressive multi-step learning framework, which accomplishes two tasks: first, we dissect the huge intensity gap into multiple segments that are easier to bridge by constructing multiple learning steps, each corresponding to various intensity levels of expression recognition tasks. Second, through a designed self-knowledge distillation (self-KD) model, each dissected gap can be bridged, enabling the MaE knowledge to progressively transfer to guide the ME learning. Experiments carried out on three widely used databases demonstrated that the proposed PLMaM achieves state-of-the-art results.",

      "abstract": "As an important research direction in the field of speech signal processing, cross-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) has attracted extensive attention. In practice, it is challenging to collect enough labeled samples from single source domain to train robust classifiers. To this end, this paper presents a novel method named multi-source unsupervised transfer components learning (MUTCL) for cross-domain SER. In MUTCL, we first adopt a PCA-like strategy and apply it to multi-source domains, aiming to preserve both intra-domain individuality and inter-domain commonality principal components within each domain. Simultaneously, a simple alignment strategy is developed to guide cross-domain samples to have similar structures, thus preserving more transfer components. Moreover, an adaptive weight strategy is utilized to determine the contribution of each source domain. We conduct experiments on five benchmark datasets, and the results show that MUTCL achieves excellent performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The precondition that most of the existing facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms have succeeded lies in that the training (source) and test (target) samples are independent of each other and identically distributed. However, it is too strict to satisfy this precondition in the real-world. To this end, we propose a novel graph-diffusion-based domain-invariant representation learning (GDRL) model for the cross-domain FER scenario where there exist distribution shifts between various domains. Specifically, a low-dimensional space mapping strategy is first adopted to diminish the domain mismatch. Then, by skillfully combining the local graph embedding and affinity graph diffusion, the local geometric structures can be effectively modeled and the deeper higher-order relationships of samples from various domains can be captured. In addition, in order to better guide the transfer process and learn a more discriminative and invariant representation, we take into account the label consistency. Experimental results on four laboratory-controlled databases and two in-the-wild databases demonstrate that our proposed model can yield better recognition performance compared with state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.",

      "abstract": "The presence of surface irregularities poses a significant threat to the quality of industrial products. Vision-based surface defect detection, known for its objectivity and stability, is extensively studied. Yet, accurately locating and discerning diverse defects proves challenging due to data scarcity and the diversity of defect types. To address these issues, we propose a new adaptive cross transformer with self-supervised contrastive learning, namely, ACViT-SCL, for surface defect detection. In ACViT, the cross transformer, as a model based on the Transformer architecture, is leveraged to address data scarcity issues through metalearning pipeline. Furthermore, the adaptive cross transformer is proposed to enhance the generalization of the cross Transformer across various defect detection tasks. Finally, the self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) is incorporated to enhance feature distinctiveness, fortifying resilience against diverse defects. To demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed method, the performance comparison between ACViT-SCL and state-of-the-art methods is conducted on three surface defect datasets. The results demonstrate that ACViT-SCL outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy and generalization ability.",

To this end, in this letter, we put forward a novel method named shared latent embedding learning for multi-view subspace clustering (SLE-MSC), which can efficiently capture a better latent space. To be specific, we introduce a pseudo-label constraint to capture the intra-view similarities within each view. Meanwhile, we utilize a novel optimal graph Laplacian to learn the consistent latent representation, in which the common manifold is considered as the optimal manifold to obtain a more reasonable local geometric structure. Comprehensive experimental results indicate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Accurately predicting protein structure, from amino acid sequences to three-dimensional structures, is of great significance in biological research. To tackle this issue, a representative deep big model, RoseTTAFold, has been proposed with promising success. Here, we report an ultra-lightweight deep graph network , named LightRoseTTA , to achieve accurate and high-efficient prediction for proteins. Notably, three highlights are possessed by our LightRoseTTA: (i) high-accurate structure prediction for proteins, being competitive with RoseTTAFold on multiple popular datasets including CASP14 and CAMEO; (ii) high-e ffi cient training and inference with an ultra-lightweight model, costing only one week on one single general NVIDIA 3090 GPU for model-training (vs 30 days on 8 high-speed NVIDIA V100 GPUs for RoseTTAFold) and containing only 1 . 4M parameters (vs 130M in RoseTTAFold); (iii) low dependency on multi-sequence alignments (MSA, widely-used homologous information), achieving the best performance on three MSA-insu ffi cient datasets: Orphan, De novo, and Orphan25 . Besides, our LightRoseTTA is transferable from general proteins to antibody data, as verified in our experiments. We visualize some case studies to demonstrate the high-quality prediction, and provide some insights on how the structure predictions facilitate the understanding of biological functions. We further make a discussion on the time and resource costs of LightRoseTTA and RoseTTAFold, and demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight models for protein structure prediction, which may be crucial in the resource-limited research for universities and academy institutions. We release our code and model to speed biological research .",

      "abstract": "The multimodal emotion recognition has attracted more attention in recent decades. Though remarkable progress has been achieved with the rapid development of deep learning, existing methods are still hard to tackle noise problems that occurred commonly in emotion recognition's practical application. To improve the robustness of the multimodal emotion recognition algorithm, we propose an MLP-based label revision algorithm. The framework consists of three complementary feature extraction networks that were verified in MER2023. After that, an MLP-based attention network with specially designed loss functions was used to fuse features from different modalities. Finally, the scheme that used the output probability of each emotion to revise the sample's output category was employed to revise the test set's label obtained by classifier. The samples that are most likely to be affected by noise and misclassified have a chance to get correct classification. The best experimental result shows that the F1-score of our algorithm on the test dataset of the MER 2023 Noise subchallenge is 86.35 and combined metric is 0.6694, which ranks 2nd at the MER 2023 NOISE subchallenge.",

      "abstract": "In the task of multimodal emotion recognition with multi-label learning (MER-MULTI), leveraging the correlation between discrete and dimensional emotions is crucial for improving the model's performance. However, there may be a mismatch between the feature distributions of the training set and the testing set, which could result in the trained model's inability to adapt to the correlations between labels in the testing set. Therefore, a significant challenge in MER-MULTI is how to match the feature distributions of the training set and testing set samples. To tackle this issue, we propose a method called Label Distribution Adaptation for MER-MULTI. More specifically, by adapting the label distribution between the training set and testing set to remove training samples that do not match the features of the testing set. This can enhance the model's performance and generalization on testing data, enabling it to better capture the correlations between labels. Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of model training and inference, we design a novel loss function called Multi-label Emotion Joint Learning Loss (MEJL), which combines the correlations between discrete and dimensional emotions. Specifically, through contrastive learning, we transform the shared feature distribution of multiple labels into a space where discrete and dimensional emotions are consistent. This facilitates the model in learning the relationships between discrete and dimensional emotions. Finally, we have evaluated the proposed method, which has achieved second place in the MER-MULTI task of the MER 2023 Challenge.",

      "abstract": "Audio-video group emotion recognition is a challenging task and has attracted more attention in recent decades. Recently, deep learning models have shown tremendous advances in analyzing human emotion. However, due to its difficulties such as hard to gather a broad range of potential information to obtain meaningful emotional representations and hard to associate implicit contextual knowledge like humans. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we proposed the Local and Global Feature Aggregation based Multi-Task Learning (LGFAM) method to tackle the Group Emotion Recognition problem. The framework consists of three parallel feature extraction networks that were verified in previous work. After that, an attention network using MLP as a backbone with specially designed loss functions was used to fuse features from different modalities. In the experiment section, we present its performance on the EmotiW2023 Audio-Visual Group-based Emotion Recognition subchallenge which aims to classify a video into one of the three emotions. According to the feedback results, the best result achieved 70.63 WAR and 70.38 UAR on the test set. Such improvement proves the effectiveness of our method.",

The lack of publicly available large-scale child facial expression databases has hindered the development of automated coding for child facial expression behaviors. In this study, we aim to address this issue by constructing a new face database for understanding <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</b> hild <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</b> acial <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</b> xpression in real <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">W</b> orld (CFEW). The database incorporates three novelties: (1) the largest publicly available child facial expression database (11,000+ images); (2) covering the full developmental range of 0-18-year-old child subjects; (3) rich annotations for facial expression labels, including discrete categories aka happy, neutral, disgust, angry, sad, cry, fear, surprise, sleepy and other facial expressions, intensity of arousal and valence, and several types of facial action units (AUs). In addition, the images in this database capture various challenging real-world conditions, including frontal and non-frontal head poses, facial occlusions, diverse illuminations, and low image resolution. To evaluate the effectiveness of the CFEW database, we conducted extensive baseline experiments using three prominent deep convolutional neural networks: vgg11_bn, ResNet18 and DenseNet121. These experiments encompassed tasks such as discrete facial expression classification, arousal and valence estimation, facial action units detection within the database, and cross-database recognition of seven facial expressions. Both the models and the database are publicly available to the research communities, referring to <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">http://aip.seu.edu.cn</uri> .",

      "abstract": "As the key to realizing aBCIs, EEG emotion recognition has been widely studied by many researchers. Previous methods have performed well for intra-subject EEG emotion recognition. However, the style mismatch between source domain (training data) and target domain (test data) EEG samples caused by huge inter-domain differences is still a critical problem for EEG emotion recognition. To solve the problem of cross-dataset EEG emotion recognition, in this paper, we propose an EEG-based Emotion Style Transfer Network (E2STN) to obtain EEG representations that contain the content information of source domain and the style information of target domain, which is called stylized emotional EEG representations. The representations are helpful for cross-dataset discriminative prediction. Concretely, E2STN consists of three modules, i.e., transfer module, transfer evaluation module, and discriminative prediction module. The transfer module encodes the domain-specific information of source and target domains and then re-constructs the source domain's emotional pattern and the target domain's statistical characteristics into the new stylized EEG representations. In this process, the transfer evaluation module is adopted to constrain the generated representations that can more precisely fuse two kinds of complementary information from source and target domains and avoid distorting. Finally, the generated stylized EEG representations are fed into the discriminative prediction module for final classification. Extensive experiments show that the E2STN can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset EEG emotion recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Under certain task conditions, error-related potential (ErrP) will be elicited, meaning that the subject is perceiving an error, responding to an external error, or engaging in a cognitive process of reinforcement learning. The detection of ErrP on a single trial basis has been studied and applied to improve all kinds of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the performance of this kind of detection is not currently good enough. In the paper, we proposed a novel method, called window-adjusted common spatial pattern (WACSP), for detecting ErrP in P300 BCI. In this method, the coefficient of determination was introduced to measure the difference of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on a channel at a moment and to guide the search of time windows in which EEG differences are significant, and common spatial pattern (CSP) was further used to capture the stable spatial patterns of EEG differences between correct and incorrect responses in each time window. WACSP and the commonly used methods were tested on the data sets that were built using the EEG signals acquired during the P300 BCI experiments with different feedback. The comparisons of accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and F-measure show that WACSP significantly outperforms the commonly used methods. The proposed method can improve ErrP detection based on a single trial.",

      "abstract": "Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) is challenging because the Micro-Expressions' (ME) motion is too weak to distinguish. This hurdle can be tackled by enhancing intensity for a more accurate acquisition of movements. However, existing magnification strategies tend to use the features of facial images that include not only intensity clues as intensity features, leading to the intensity representation deficient of credibility. In addition, the intensity variation over time, which is crucial for encoding movements, is also neglected. To this end, we provide a reliable scheme to extract intensity clues while considering their variation on the time scale. First, we devise an Intensity Distillation (ID) loss to acquire the intensity clues by contrasting the difference between frames, given that the difference in the same video lies only in the intensity. Then, the intensity clues are calibrated to follow the trend of the original video. Specifically, due to the lack of truth intensity annotation of the original video, we build the intensity tendency by setting each intensity vacancy an uncertain value, which guides the extracted intensity clues to converge towards this trend rather some fixed values. A Wilcoxon rank sum test (Wrst) method is enforced to implement the calibration. Experimental results on three public ME databases i.e. CASME II, SAMM, and SMIC-HS validate the superiority against state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "In practical facial expression recognition (FER), the training data and test data are often obtained from different domains. It is obvious that the domain disparity could significantly degrade the recognition performance. To tackle this challenging cross-domain FER problem, we put forward a novel method termed common latent embedding space (CLES). To be specific, first, we obtain a common embedding space for cross-domain samples by matrix factorization (MF). Then, the dual-graph Laplacian is applied to this common embedding space to narrow the gap across distinct domains and, meanwhile, explores the inherent geometric information. Furthermore, to characterize the global relationship of the cross-domain samples, the self-representation strategy is used to guide the learning of the common embedding space. Finally, comprehensive experiments on four benchmark databases indicate that the proposed method can achieve better performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain FER tasks.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep transfer learning method called deep implicit distribution alignment networks (DIDAN) to deal with cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) problem, in which the labeled training (source) and unlabeled testing (target) speech signals come from different corpora. Specifically, DIDAN first adopts a simple deep regression network consisting of a set of convolutional and fully connected layers to directly regress the source speech spectrums into the emotional labels such that the proposed DIDAN can own the emotion discriminative ability. Then, such ability is transferred to be also applicable to the target speech samples regardless of corpus variance by resorting to a well-designed regularization term called implicit distribution alignment (IDA). Unlike widely-used maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and its variants, the proposed IDA absorbs the idea of sample reconstruction to implicitly align the distribution gap, which enables DIDAN to learn both emotion discriminative and corpus invariant features from speech spectrums. To evaluate the proposed DIDAN, extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on widely-used speech emotion corpora are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed DIDAN can outperform lots of recent state-of-the-art methods in coping with the cross-corpus SER tasks.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, named generalized subspace distribution adaptation (GSDA), to tackle the challenging cross-corpus speech emotion recognition problem. First, we learn a common low-dimensional feature subspace by utilizing a generalized subspace learning method. Second, we develop a novel distance metric to reduce the divergence between the source and target corpora, which can efficiently explore the similarity and dissimilarity information in the process of knowledge transfer. Third, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply GSDA to the traditional subspace learning algorithms. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments by using the low-level features and deep features on three popular emotional databases, i.e., Berlin, IEMOCAP, and CVE. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better performance than several state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches.",

      "abstract": "Cross-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) is an effective strategy to improve the generalization ability of emotion classification models, which is an important research direction in speech signal processing. However, since the speech signals are non-stationary, it is difficult to train a robust classifier from single-source emotional corpus. To solve this shortcoming, we propose a novel method named multi-source discriminant subspace alignment (MDSA) for cross-domain SER. In MDSA, we first conduct linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the multi-source domain. Then, the instances in the multi-source discriminant subspace are used to linearly reconstruct the instances in the target subspace. At the same time, the reconstruction contribution of each source discriminant subspace is determined by adaptive weights. Furthermore, the multi-source discriminant subspace is aligned by reducing the loss between projections, which can make our model more robust. In this way, MDSA considers both the alignment of cross-domain data distribution and the structural information of cross-domain instances. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on five standard emotional corpora, i.e., Berlin, IEMOCAP, CVE, EMOVO, and TESS, and the results demonstrate the proposed MDSA is superior to several state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in terms of performance.

      "abstract": "The target recognition performance of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces can be significantly improved with a training-based approach. However, the training procedure is time consuming and often causes fatigue. Consequently, the number of training data should be limited, which may reduce the classification performance. Thus, how to improve classification accuracy without increasing the training time is crucial to SSVEP-based BCI system. This study proposes a transfer-related component analysis (TransRCA) method for addressing the above issue. In this method, the SSVEP-related components are extracted from a small number of training data of the current individual and combined with those extracted from a large number of existing training data of other individuals. The TransRCA method maximizes not only the inter-trial covariances between the source and target subjects, but also the correlation between the reference signals and SSVEP signals from the source and target subjects. The proposed method was validated on the SSVEP public Benchmark and BETA datasets, and the classification accuracy and information transmission rate of the ensemble version of the proposed TransRCA method were compared with those of the state-of-the-art eCCA, eTRCA, ttCCA, LSTeTRCA, and eIISMC methods on both datasets. The comparison results indicate that the proposed method provides a superior performance compared with these state-of-the-art methods, and thus has high potential for the development of a SSVEP-based brain-computer interface system with high classification performance that only uses a small number of training data.",

      "abstract": "Spectrogram is commonly used as the input feature of deep neural networks to learn the high(er)-level time–frequency pattern of speech signal for speech emotion recognition (SER). Generally, different emotions correspond to specific energy activations both within frequency bands and time frames on spectrogram, which indicates the frequency and time domains are both essential to represent the emotion for SER. However, recent spectrogram-based works mainly focus on modeling the long-term dependency in time domain, which makes these methods suffer from the following issues: 1) neglecting to model the emotion-related correlations within frequency domain during the time–frequency joint learning and 2) ignoring to capture the specific frequency bands associated with emotions. To cope with the issues, we propose an attentive time–frequency neural network (ATFNN) for SER, including a time–frequency neural network (TFNN) and time–frequency attention. Specifically, aiming at the first issue, we design a TFNN with a frequency-domain encoder (F-Encoder) based on the Transformer encoder and a time-domain encoder (T-Encoder) based on the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The F-Encoder and T-Encoder model the correlations within frequency bands and time frames, respectively, and they are embedded into a time–frequency joint learning strategy to obtain the time–frequency patterns of speech emotions. Moreover, to handle the second issue, we adopt the time–frequency attention with a frequency-attention network (F-Attention) and a time-attention network (T-Attention) to focus on the emotion-related long-range dependencies between frequency bands and across time frames, which can enhance the emotional discrimination of speech features. Extensive experimental results on three public emotional databases, i.e., IEMOCAP, ABC, and CASIA, show that our proposed ATFNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

Specifically, on one hand, a subspace projection matrix is first learned to project the cross-database features into a common subspace. At the same time, each target sample can be represented by the source samples by using a sparse reconstruction matrix. On the other hand, we design an adaptive weighted matrix learning strategy, which can improve the reconstruction contribution of important features and eliminate the negative influence of redundant features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark databases, and the experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Existing works for spontaneous Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) tend to encode Micro-Expression (ME) movements to get more discriminative features. However, MEs' low intensity makes the capture for motion extremely difficult, and the widely adopted unified-magnification strategy is prone to noise and lacks flexibility. To this end, this paper provides a new insight to encode ME motion and tackle magnification noise. Specifically, we reconstruct a new sequence via magnification techniques to make subtle ME movements more distinguishable. Afterward, Sparse Self-Attention (SSA) rectifies self-attention with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), cutting the space into several hush buckets of related features. Only keys in the same bucket are operated in the attention term for every query feature. The resulting sparsity in the attention matrix prevents the network from attending features stemming from less-informative magnification degrees which could be regarded as noise, while retains the sequence modelling capability of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on three public MER databases demonstrate our superiority against the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MER</i> ) has attracted the attention of many researchers in the past decade. However, occlusion occurs for MER in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a challenging issue in MER that is interesting but unexplored, i.e., occlusion MER, is deeply investigated. First, to research MER under real-world occlusion conditions, synthetic occluded microexpression databases are created by using various community masks. Second, to suppress the influence of occlusion, a <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</u> egion-inspired <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</u> elation <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</u> easoning <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</u> etwork ( <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RRRN</i> ) is proposed to model the relations between various facial regions. The RRRN consists of a backbone network, a region-inspired (RI) module and a relation reasoning (RR) module. More specifically, the backbone network aims to extract feature representations from different facial regions, the RI module is designed to compute the adaptive weight from the facial region itself based on the unobstructedness and importance of the region for suppressing the influence of occlusion using an attention mechanism, and the RR module exploits the progressive interactions among these regions by performing graph convolutions. Experiments are conducted on two tasks of MEGC 2018: the holdout-database evaluation task and the composite database evaluation task. Experimental results show that RRRN can be utilized to significantly explore the importance of facial regions and capture the cooperative complementary relationship of facial regions for MER. The results also demonstrate that RRRN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially with respect to occlusion, where RRRN is more robust.",

      "abstract": "Human emotion is closely related to multiple distributed brain regions, and functional connections exist between the regions. However, how to abstract the region-level information to improve electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition performance has not been well considered. To address this problem, we proposed a novel Adaptive Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (AHGCN), which includes the basic channel-level graph of EEG channels and the region-level graph of brain regions. Different from previous methods, we propose an adaptive pooling operation to automatically partition brain regions rather than manually define them. To capture the intrinsic functional connections between the brain regions or EEG channels, we design a gated adaptive graph convolution operation. Besides, we develop a graph unpooling operation to integrate the region-level graph and channel-level graph to extract more discrimination features for classification. Experiments on two widely-used datasets show that our proposed method is superior to many state-of-the-art methods on EEG emotion recognition and could find some interesting combinations of EEG channels.",

These outlier samples are usually far from the center of the dataset in the feature space, resulting in huge differences in feature distribution, which severely restricts the performance of cross-dataset facial expression recognition (FER). To eliminate the influence of outlier samples on cross-dataset FER, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method called Sample Self-Revised Network (SSRN), which 1) dynamically detects the outlier level of each sample in the source domain to reduce the disturbance of outlier samples to the model training, as well as 2) adaptively revises outlier samples in the source domain to improve transferability of the learned features. Experimental results show that our SSRN outperforms both classic deep UDA methods and state-of-the-art cross-dataset FER results.",

      "abstract": "Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition relies on single-task learning, which may lead to overfitting and learned emotion features lacking generalization. In this paper, a graph-based multi-task self-supervised learning model (GMSS) for EEG emotion recognition is proposed. GMSS has the ability to learn more general representations by integrating multiple self-supervised tasks, including spatial and frequency jigsaw puzzle tasks, and contrastive learning tasks. By learning from multiple tasks simultaneously, GMSS can find a representation that captures all of the tasks thereby decreasing the chance of overfitting on the original task, i.e., emotion recognition task. In particular, the spatial jigsaw puzzle task aims to capture the intrinsic spatial relationships of different brain regions. Considering the importance of frequency information in EEG emotional signals, the goal of the frequency jigsaw puzzle task is to explore the crucial frequency bands for EEG emotion recognition. To further regularize the learned features and encourage the network to learn inherent representations, contrastive learning task is adopted in this work by mapping the transformed data into a common feature space. The performance of the proposed GMSS is compared with several popular unsupervised and supervised methods. Experiments on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets show that the proposed model has remarkable advantages in learning more discriminative and general features for EEG emotional signals.",

      "abstract": "Micro-Expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the short duration and low intensity of Micro-Expressions. A popular method to tackle this is magnifying MEs so as to enlarge the expression intensity to make recognition easier. However, the single fixed magnification strategy, widely used in existing works of MER, is not appropriate for different subjects, because each subject has specific expression intensity corresponding to different MEs. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel Attention-based Magnification-Adaptive Network (AMAN) to learn adaptive magnification levels for the ME representation. The network consists of two modules: magnification attention (MA module) to adaptively focus on appropriate magnification levels of different MEs, and frame attention (FA module) to focus on discriminative aggregated frames in a ME video. Extensive experiments on three widely used databases manifest that our method yields state-of-art results compared with other methods.",

      "abstract": "Traditional facial expression recognition (FER) has achieved satisfactory results to some extent, and most of the current methods are trained and evaluated on a single database. However, in real applications, the training and testing images are often collected in different scenarios, which will lead to performance degeneration. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, named joint local-global discriminative subspace transfer learning (LGDSTL), for cross-database FER. In LGDSTL, first, we develop a joint local-global graph as the distance metric, in which we not only consider the local discriminative geometric structure for each database, but also consider a global graph to transfer knowledge. In this way, the discrepancy between the two databases will be significantly reduced. Then, we present a pairwise regression function to guide the discriminative subspace transfer learning. Additionally, a data reconstruction constraint is introduced to preserve the main discriminative information. Finally, comparative studies on six popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The main characteristic of depression is emotional dysfunction, manifested by increased levels of negative emotions and decreased levels of positive emotions. Therefore, accurate emotion recognition is an effective way to assess depression. Among the various signals used for emotion recognition, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal has attracted widespread attention due to its multiple advantages, such as rich spatiotemporal information in multi-channel EEG signals. First, we use filtering and Euclidean alignment for data preprocessing. In the feature extraction, we use short-time Fourier transform and Hilbert–Huang transform to extract time-frequency features, and convolutional neural networks to extract spatial features. Finally, bi-directional long short-term memory explored the timing relationship. Before performing the convolution operation, according to the unique topology of the EEG channel, the EEG features are converted into 3D tensors. This study has achieved good results on two emotion databases: SEED and Emotional BCI of 2020 WORLD ROBOT COMPETITION. We applied this method to the recognition of depression based on EEG and achieved a recognition rate of more than 70% under the five-fold cross-validation. In addition, the subject-independent protocol on SEED data has achieved a state-of-the-art recognition rate, which exceeds the existing research methods. We propose a novel EEG emotion recognition framework for depression detection, which provides a robust algorithm for real-time clinical depression detection based on EEG.",

Each vertex node in a graph represents a cell in quasi-periodic array and the features of each vertex node are determined by the geometric parameters of the corresponding cell. The connections in graph are initialized and dynamically updated to learn the mutual coupling among cells. DGCNNs are constructed and trained such that the neural networks can obtain the relationships among cells. The trained DGCNNs can predict the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i> -parameters of a quasi-periodic array and the numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method.",

However, calculating the expansion coefficients of SED basis functions is very time-consuming due to the consideration of the mutual coupling between all the elements in LFPSs, even after accelerated by conjugate-gradient fast Fourier transform (CG-FFT) and/or fast multipole method (FMM). In this article, based on the physics locations of observation cells, the adaptive artificial neural networks (AANNs) have been employed to rapidly predict the expansion coefficients of SED basis functions on interior cells, edge cells, and corner cells. By involving the AANNs, the mutual coupling between all the elements can be accounted into the neural networks without the construction of the mutual coupling matrix, and the expansion coefficients of SED basis functions can be obtained rapidly. Numerical experiments prove the accuracy and efficiency of the AANN-assisted SED basis functions method.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: As a direct bridge between the brain and the outer world, brain–computer interface (BCI) is expected to replace, restore, enhance, supplement, or improve the natural output of brain. The prospect of BCI serving humans is very broad. However, the extensive applications of BCI have not been fully achieved. One of reasons is that the cost of calibration reduces the convenience and usability of BCI. Methods: In this study, we proposed a calibration-free approach, which is based on the ideas of reinforcement learning and transfer learning, for P300-based BCI. This approach, composed of two algorithms: P300 linear upper confidence bound (PLUCB) and transferred PLUCB (TPLUCB), is able to learn during the usage by exploration and exploitation and allows P300-based BCI to start working without any calibration. Results: We tested the performances of PLUCB and TPLUCB using stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), a commonly used method that needs calibration, as a baseline in simulated online experiments. The results showed the merits of PLUCB and TPLUCB. PLUCB can quickly increase the accuracies to the level of SWLDA. TPLUCB has surpassed SWLDA in the sample accuracy since it starts running. Both PLUCB and TPLUCB have the ability to keep improving the classification performance during the process. The overall sample accuracies (73.6 ± 4.8 % , 73.1 ± 4.9 %), overall symbol accuracies (80.4 ± 12.8 % , 79.6 ± 14.0 %), F-measures (0.45 ± 0.06 , 0.44 ± 0.06) and information transfer ratios (ITR) (36.4 ± 9.1 , 35.5 ± 9.8) of PLUCB and TPLUCB are significantly better than those of SWLDA (overall sample accuracy: 58.8 ± 3.8 % , overall symbol accuracy: 69.0 ± 18.3 % , F-measure: 0.38 ± 0.04 , ITR: 28.7 ± 10.7). Conclusions: The proposed approach, which does not need calibration but outperform SWLDA, is a very good option for the implementation of P300-based BCI.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel domain invariant feature learning (DIFL) method to deal with speaker-independent speech emotion recognition (SER). The basic idea of DIFL is to learn the speaker-invariant emotion feature by eliminating domain shifts between the training and testing data caused by different speakers from the perspective of multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, we embed a hierarchical alignment layer with the strong-weak distribution alignment strategy into the feature extraction block to firstly reduce the discrepancy in feature distributions of speech samples across different speakers as much as possible. Furthermore, multiple discriminators in the discriminator block are utilized to confuse the speaker information of emotion features both inside the training data and between the training and testing data. Through them, a multi-domain invariant representation of emotional speech can be gradually and adaptively achieved by updating network parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, i. e., Emo-DB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA, to evaluate the SER performance of the proposed method, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised Feature selection is an important dimensionality reduction technique to cope with high-dimensional data. It does not require prior label information, and has recently attracted much attention. However, it cannot fully utilize the discriminative information of samples, which may affect the feature selection performance. To tackle this problem, in this letter, we propose a novel discriminative virtual label regression method (DVLR) for unsupervised feature selection. In DVLR, we develop a virtual label regression function to guide the subspace learning based feature selection, which can select more discriminative features. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) term is used to make the model be more discriminative. To further make the model be more robust and select more representative features, we impose the ℓ2,1-norm on the regression and feature selection terms. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on several public datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed DVLR achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, we propose a novel transferable sparse regression (TSR) method, for cross-database facial expression recognition (FER). In TSR, we firstly present a novel regression function to regress the data into a latent representation space instead of a strict binary label space. To further alleviate the influence of outliers and overfitting, we impose a row sparsity constraint on the regression term. And a pairwise relation term is introduced to guide the feature transfer learning. Secondly, we design a global graph to transfer knowledge, which can well preserve the cross-database manifold structure. Moreover, we introduce a low-rank constraint on the graph regularization term to uncover additional structural information. Finally, several experiments are conducted on three popular facial expression databases, and the results validate that the proposed TSR method is superior to other non-deep and deep transfer learning methods.",

      "abstract": "Cross-Database Micro-Expression Recognition (CDMER) aims to develop the Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods with strong domain adaptability, i.e., the ability to recognize the Micro-Expressions (MEs) of different subjects captured by different imaging devices in different scenes. The development of CDMER is faced with two key problems: 1) the severe feature distribution gap between the source and target databases; 2) the feature representation bottleneck of ME such local and subtle facial expressions. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel Transfer Group Sparse Regression method, namely TGSR, which aims to 1) optimize the measurement and better alleviate the difference between the source and target databases, and 2) highlight the valid facial regions to enhance extracted features, by the operation of selecting the group features from the raw face feature, where each region is associated with a group of raw face feature, i.e., the salient facial region selection. Compared with previous transfer group sparse methods, our proposed TGSR has the ability to select the salient facial regions, which is effective in alleviating the aforementioned problems for better performance and reducing the computational cost at the same time. We use two public ME databases, i.e., CASME II and SMIC, to evaluate our proposed TGSR method. Experimental results show that our proposed TGSR learns the discriminative and explicable regions, and outperforms most state-of-the-art subspace-learning-based domain-adaptive methods for CDMER.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a fully integrated wideband current-mode digital power amplifier (DPA) for digital polar transmitter in a 22nm RF CMOS process. Current-mode class-D configuration and differential cascode structure are used to obtain high efficiency, noise reduction and high output power with limited supply voltage. A three-coil transformer-based output passive network provides power combining and optimum load impedance transformations simultaneously at two operating frequencies. As a proof-of-concept, a 2.4–5.25 GHz wideband DPA is implemented with supply voltage of 1V for driver circuit and 2.5V for power cells. The simulated peak DPA output power is 30.0dBm/27.5dBm at 2.4GHz/5.25GHz. The simulated peak drain efficiency is 49.8% at 2.4GHz.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Multi‐view facial action unit (AU) analysis has been a challenging research topic due to multiple disturbing variables, including subject identity biases, variational facial action unit intensities, facial occlusions and non‐frontal head‐poses. A deep feature enhancement (DFE) framework is presented to tackle some of these coupled complex disturbing variables for multi‐view facial action unit detection. The authors' DFE framework is a novel end‐to‐end three‐stage feature learning model with taking subject identity biases, dynamic facial changes and head‐pose into consideration. It contains three feature enhancement modules, including coarse‐grained local and holistic spatial feature learning (LHSF), spatio‐temporal feature learning (STF) and head‐pose feature disentanglement (FD). Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved state‐of‐the‐art recognition performance on the FERA2017 dataset. The code is released at http://aip.seu.edu.cn/cgtang/ .",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) is a challenging task in Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI). Since it is still not very clear about the intrinsic connection relationship among the various EEG channels, it is still a challenging task of how to better represent the topology of EEG channels for emotion recognition. On the other hand, the intensity of the emotion may vary along the different time instants, which would affect the recognition accuracy of emotion. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel multichannel EEG emotion recognition method called attention-based spatiotemporal graphic long short-term memory (ASTG-LSTM), in which a Dynamic Structured Learning (DSL) branch that focuses on the most emotion-relevant connectivity of the brain is incorporated to represent inter-channel connections of the EEG signals. In addition, a specific spatio-temporal attention is embedded into the DSL branch to improve the invariance ability against the emotional intensity fluctuation. Extensive experiments on: DEAP and DREAMER are conducted and the experimental results indicate that the proposed ASTG-LSTM model improves the EEG emotion recognition performance compared with many state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (\\textbf{MER}) has attracted lots of researchers' attention in a decade. However, occlusion will occur for MER in real-world scenarios. This paper deeply investigates an interesting but unexplored challenging issue in MER, \\ie, occlusion MER. First, to research MER under real-world occlusion, synthetic occluded micro-expression databases are created by using various mask for the community. Second, to suppress the influence of occlusion, a \\underline{R}egion-inspired \\underline{R}elation \\underline{R}easoning \\underline{N}etwork (\\textbf{RRRN}) is proposed to model relations between various facial regions. RRRN consists of a backbone network, the Region-Inspired (\\textbf{RI}) module and Relation Reasoning (\\textbf{RR}) module. More specifically, the backbone network aims at extracting feature representations from different facial regions, RI module computing an adaptive weight from the region itself based on attention mechanism with respect to the unobstructedness and importance for suppressing the influence of occlusion, and RR module exploiting the progressive interactions among these regions by performing graph convolutions. Experiments are conducted on handout-database evaluation and composite database evaluation tasks of MEGC 2018 protocol. Experimental results show that RRRN can significantly explore the importance of facial regions and capture the cooperative complementary relationship of facial regions for MER. The results also demonstrate RRRN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially on occlusion, and RRRN acts more robust to occlusion.",

However, information regarding the VMI characteristics of children with ASD is scarce because existing assessment methods have focused on outcome measures while neglecting process measures due to the high failure rates in children with ASD. Therefore, the current pilot study was conducted to explore the appropriate indicators for the construction of a comprehensive VMI evaluation. First, five computer games were designed to provide enjoyable and appropriate tasks for use in VMI assessment while ensuring a high completion rate among the participants. Then, 30 children with ASD and 30 age-matched typically developing (TD) children between 4 and 6 years old were recruited to play the games. In this process, several quantitative indicators were applied to infer the children's visual perception, eye-hand coordination, and fine motor skills. Finally, the validity of the proposed method was verified using three classic machine-learning algorithms. The results revealed that the proposed method is effective in providing a comprehensive description of VMI deficits and can thus ultimately provide an objective basis for targeted interventions.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition from electroencephalograph (EEG) signals has long been essential for affective computing. In this article, we evaluate EEG emotion recognition by converting EEG signals from multiple channels into images such that richer spatial information can be considered and the question of EEG-based emotion recognition can be converted into image recognition. To this end, we propose a novel method to generate continuous images from discrete EEG signals by introducing offset variables following a Gaussian distribution for each EEG channel to alleviate the biased electrode coordinates during image generation. In addition, a novel graph-embedded convolutional neural network (GECNN) method is proposed to combine the local convolutional neural network (CNN) features with global functional features to provide complementary emotion information. In GECNN, the attention mechanism is applied to extract more discriminative local features. Simultaneously, dynamical graph filtering explores the intrinsic relationships between different EEG regions. The local and global functional features are finally fused for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments in subject-dependent and subject-independent protocols are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed GECNN model on four datasets, i.e., SEED, SDEA, DREAMER, and MPED.",

      "abstract": "Message passing neural network has been an effective method to represent dependencies among nodes by propagating messages. However, most of message passing algorithms focus on one structure and messages are estimated by one single approach. For real-world data, like facial action units (AUs), the dependencies may vary in terms of different expressions and individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid message passing neural network with performance-driven structures (HMP-PS), which combines complementary message passing methods and captures more possible structures in a Bayesian manner. Particularly, a performance-driven Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method is proposed for generating high performance graph structures. Besides, hybrid message passing is proposed to combine different types of messages, which provide the complementary information. The contribution of each type of message is adaptively adjusted along with different inputs. The experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., BP4D and DISFA, validate that our proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning methods have been widely applied to automatic facial action unit (AU) intensity estimation and achieved the state-of-the-art performance. These methods, however, are mostly appearance-based and fail to exploit the underlying structural information among AUs. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic probabilistic graph convolution (DPG) model to simultaneously exploit AU appearances, AU dynamics, and their semantic structural dependencies for AU intensity estimation. Firstly, we propose to use Bayesian Network to capture the inherent dependencies among AUs. Secondly, we introduce probabilistic graph convolution that allows to perform graph convolution on the distribution of Bayesian Network structure to extract AU structural features. Finally, we introduce a dynamic deep model based on LSTM to simultaneously combine AU appearance features, AU dynamic features, and AU structural features for AU intensity estimation. In experiments, our method achieves comparable and even better performance with the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark facial AU intensity estimation databases, i.e., FERA 2015 and DISFA.",

      "abstract": "Capturing the dependencies among different facial action units (AU) is extremely important for the AU detection task. Many studies have employed graph-based deep learning methods to exploit the dependencies among AUs. However, the dependencies among AUs in real world data are often noisy and the uncertainty is essential to be taken into consideration. Rather than employing a deterministic mode, we propose an uncertain graph neural network (UGN) to learn the probabilistic mask that simultaneously captures both the individual dependencies among AUs and the uncertainties. Further, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function based on the epistemic uncertainties to adaptively vary the weights of the training samples during the training process to account for unbalanced data distributions among AUs. We also provide an insightful analysis on how the uncertainties are related to the performance of AU detection. Extensive experiments, conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e., BP4D and DISFA, demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

Due to this fact, mismatched feature distributions may exist between the training and testing speech feature sets degrading the performance of most originally well-performing SER methods. To deal with cross-corpus SER, we propose a novel domain adaptation (DA) method called joint distribution adaptive regression (JDAR). The basic idea of JDAR is to learn a regression matrix by jointly considering the marginal and conditional probability distribution between the training and testing speech signals and hence their feature distribution dierence can be alleviated in the subspace spanned by the learned regression matrix. To evaluate the proposed JDAR, we conduct extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA speech databases. Experimental results show that the proposed JDAR achieves satisfactory performance and outperforms most of state-of-the-art subspace learning based DA methods.",

      "abstract": "An assumption widely used in traditional facial expression recognition algorithms is that the training and testing are conducted on the same dataset. However, this assumption does not hold in practice, in which the training data and testing data are often from different datasets. In this scenario, directly deploying these algorithms would lead to severe information loss and performance degradation due to the domain shift. To address this challenging problem, in this article, we propose a novel transferable sparse subspace representation method (TSSR) for cross-corpus facial expression recognition. Specifically, in order to reduce the cross-corpus mismatch, inspired by sparse subspace clustering, we advocate reconstructing the source and target samples using the source data points based on <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _1-$</tex-math></inline-formula> norm sparse representation. Each data point in source and target corpora can be ideally represented as a combination of a few other source points from its own subspace. Moreover, we take into account the local geometrical information within the cross-corpus data by adopting a graph Laplacian regularizer, which can efficiently preserve the local manifold structure and better transfer knowledge between two corpora. Finally, extensive experiments on several facial expression datasets are conducted to evaluate the recognition performance of TSSR. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The individual differences and the dynamic uncertain relationships among different electroencephalogram (EEG) regions are essential factors that limit EEG emotion recognition. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a variational instance-adaptive graph method (V-IAG) that simultaneously captures the individual dependencies among different EEG electrodes and estimates the underlying uncertain information. Specifically, we employ two branches, i.e., instance-adaptive branch and variational branch, to construct the graph. Inspired by the attention mechanism, the instance-adaptive branch generates the graph based on the input so as to characterize the individual dependencies among EEG channels. The variational branch generates the probabilistic graph, which quantifies the uncertainties. We combine these two types of graphs to extract more discriminative features. To present more precise graph representation, we propose a new operation named the multi-level and multi-graph convolution operation, which aggregates the features of EEG channels from different frequencies with different graphs. Furthermore, we design the graph coarsening and employ the sparse constraint to obtain more robust features. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used EEG emotion recognition databases, i.e., SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED), multi-modal physiological emotion recognition dataset (MPED) and DREAMER. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the-state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Background: One of the most critical issues in human-computer interaction applications is recognizing human emotions based on speech. In recent years, the challenging problem of cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) has generated extensive research. Nevertheless, the domain discrepancy between training data and testing data remains a major challenge to achieving improved system performance. Methods: This paper introduces a novel multi-scale discrepancy adversarial (MSDA) network for conducting multiple timescales domain adaptation for cross-corpus SER, i.e.,integrating domain discriminators of hierarchical levels into the emotion recognition framework to mitigate the gap between the source and target domains. Specifically, we extract two kinds of speech features, i.e., handcraft features and deep features, from three timescales of global, local, and hybrid levels. In each timescale, the domain discriminator and the emotion classifier compete against each other to learn features that minimize the discrepancy between the two domains by fooling the discriminator. Results: Extensive experiments on cross-corpus and cross-language SER were conducted on a combination dataset that combines one Chinese dataset and two English datasets commonly used in SER. The MSDA is affected by the strong discriminate power provided by the adversarial process, where three discriminators are working in tandem with an emotion classifier. Accordingly, the MSDA achieves the best performance over all other baseline methods. Conclusions: The proposed architecture was tested on a combination of one Chinese and two English datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our powerful discriminative model for solving cross-corpus SER.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Emotion recognition from EEG signals has attracted much attention in affective computing. Recently, a novel dynamic graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) model was proposed, which simultaneously optimized the network parameters and a weighted graph G characterizing the strength of functional relation between each pair of two electrodes in the EEG recording equipment. In this paper, we propose a sparse DGCNN model which improves the DGCNN by imposing a sparseness constraint on G. Our work is based on an important observation: the tomography study reveals that different brain regions sampled by EEG electrodes may be related to different functions of the brain and then the functional relations among electrodes are possibly highly localized and sparse. However, introducing sparseness constraint into the graph G makes the loss function of sparse DGCNN non-differentiable at some singular points. To ensure that the training process of sparse DGCNN converges, we apply the forward-backward splitting method. To evaluate the performance of sparse DGCNN, we compare it with four representative recognition methods as well as different features and spectral bands. The results show that (1) sparse DGCNN has consistently better accuracy than representative methods and has a good scalability, and (2) DE, PSD and ASM features on &amp;gamma; bands convey most discriminative emotional information, and fusion of separate features and frequency bands can improve recognition performance.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "How to encode as many targets as possible with a limited-frequency resource is a difficult problem in the practical use of a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) speller. To solve this problem, this study developed a novel method called dual-frequency biased coding (DFBC) to tag targets in a SSVEP-based 48-character virtual speller, in which each target is encoded with a permutation sequence consisting of two permuted flickering periods that flash at different frequencies. The proposed paradigm was validated by 11 participants in an offline experiment and 7 participants in an online experiment. Three occipital channels (O1, Oz, and O2) were used to obtain the SSVEP signals for identifying the targets. Based on the coding characteristics of the DFBC method, the proposed approach has the ability of self-correction and thus achieves an accuracy of 76.6% and 79.3% for offline and online experiments, respectively, which outperforms the traditional multiple frequencies sequential coding (MFSC) method. This study demonstrates that DFBC is an efficient method for coding a high number of SSVEP targets with a small number of available frequencies.",

      "abstract": "The topdown determined visual object perception refers to the ability of a person to identify a prespecified visual target. This paper studies the technical foundation for measuring the target-perceptual ability in a guided visual search task, using the EEG-based brain imaging technique. Specifically, it focuses on the feature representation learning problem for single-trial classification of fixation-related potentials (FRPs). The existing methods either capture only first-order statistics while ignoring second-order statistics in data, or directly extract second-order statistics with covariance matrices estimated with raw FRPs that suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning pipeline involving a low-level convolution subnetwork followed by a high-level Riemannian manifold subnetwork, with a novel midlevel pooling layer bridging them. In this way, the discriminative power of the first-order features can be increased by the convolution subnetwork, while the second-order information in the convolutional features could further be deeply learned with the subsequent Riemannian subnetwork. In particular, the temporal ordering of FRPs is well preserved for the components in our pipeline, which is considered to be a valuable source of discriminant information. The experimental results show that proposed approach leads to improved classification performance and robustness to lack of data over the state-of-the-art ones, thus making it appealing for practical applications in measuring the target-perceptual ability of cognitively impaired patients with the FRP technique.",

      "abstract": "Correctly perceiving micro-expression is difficult since micro-expression is an involuntary, repressed, and subtle facial expression, and efficiently revealing the subtle movement changes and capturing the significant segments in a micro-expression sequence is the key to micro-expression recognition (MER). To handle the crucial issue, in this paper, we firstly propose a dynamic segmented sparse imaging module (DSSI) to compute dynamic images as local-global spatiotemporal descriptors under a unique sampling protocol, which reveals the subtle movement changes visually in an efficient way. Secondly, a segmented movement-attending spatiotemporal network (SMA-STN) is proposed to further unveil imperceptible small movement changes, which utilizes a spatiotemporal movement-attending module (STMA) to capture long-distance spatial relation for facial expression and weigh temporal segments. Besides, a deviation enhancement loss (DE-Loss) is embedded in the SMA-STN to enhance the robustness of SMA-STN to subtle movement changes in feature level. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., CASME II, SAMM, and SHIC, show that the proposed SMA-STN achieves better MER performance than other state-of-the-art methods, which proves that the proposed method is effective to handle the challenging MER problem.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a new neonatal facial expression database for pain analysis. This database, called facial expression of neonatal pain (FENP), contains 11,000 neonatal facial expression images associated with 106 Chinese neonates from two children's hospitals, i.e., the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University and Second Affiliated Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University in China. The facial expression images cover four categories of facial expressions, i.e., severe pain expression, mild pain expression, crying expression and calmness expression, where each category contains 2750 neonatal facial expression images. Based on this database, we also investigate the pain facial expression recognition problem using several state-of-the-art facial expression features and expression recognition methods, such as Gabor+SVM, LBP+SVM, HOG+SVM, LBP+HOG+SVM, and several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods (including AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet and DenseNet). The experimental results indicate that the proposed neonatal pain facial expression database is very suitable for the study of both neonatal pain and facial expression recognition. Moreover, the FENP database is publicly available after signing a license agreement (the users can contact Jingjie Yan (yanjingjie@njupt.edu.cn), Guanming Lu (lugm@njupt.edu.cn)) or Xiaonan Li (xnli@njmu.edu.cn).",

      "abstract": "Recently, facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild has gained a lot of researchers' attention because it is a valuable topic to enable the FER techniques to move from the laboratory to the real applications. In this paper, we focus on this challenging but interesting topic and make contributions from three aspects. First, we present a new large-scale 'in-the-wild' dynamic facial expression database, DFEW (Dynamic Facial Expression in the Wild), consisting of over 16,000 video clips from thousands of movies. These video clips contain various challenging interferences in practical scenarios such as extreme illumination, occlusions, and capricious pose changes. Second, we propose a novel method called Expression-Clustered Spatiotemporal Feature Learning (EC-STFL) framework to deal with dynamic FER in the wild. Third, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on DFEW using a lot of spatiotemporal deep feature learning methods as well as our proposed EC-STFL. Experimental results show that DFEW is a well-designed and challenging database, and the proposed EC-STFL can promisingly improve the performance of existing spatiotemporal deep neural networks in coping with the problem of dynamic FER in the wild. Our DFEW database is publicly available and can be freely downloaded from https://dfew-dataset.github.io/.",

      "abstract": "We propose an unsupervised cross-view facial expression adaptation network (UCFEAN) to simultaneously generate and recognize cross-view facial expressions in images in an unsupervised manner. The main idea of UCFEAN is to convert the unsupervised domain adaptation between two image spaces with different appearance into semi-supervised learning (SSL) in feature spaces with the same semantic content. The cyclic image generation of cross-view facial expressions based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is carried out to project unlabelled target images and labelled source images to the corresponding feature spaces with the same semantic content. This helps realize the unsupervised feature learning of the target image. Labels of facial expressions represented in the projected target features can then be learned using the projected source features, because the distributions of the projected features in the two domains are close enough for knowledge transfer by using SSL. Three techniques are developed to train UCFEAN in an effective and stable manner. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the UCFEAN on two multi-view facial expression image databases including RaFD and Multi-PIE. The results show that the proposed method can generate realistic target images of the facial expression and recognize cross-view facial expressions with high precision.",

      "abstract": "It is reported that the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could be improved by effective early interventions, which arouses an urgent need for large-scale early identification of ASD. Until now, the screening of ASD has relied on the child psychiatrist to collect medical history and conduct behavioral observations with the help of psychological assessment tools. Such screening measures inevitably have some disadvantages, including strong subjectivity, relying on experts and low-efficiency. With the development of computer science, it is possible to realize a computer-aided screening for ASD and alleviate the disadvantages of manual evaluation. In this study, we propose a behavior-based automated screening method to identify high-risk ASD (HR-ASD) for babies aged 8-24 months. The still-face paradigm (SFP) was used to elicit baby's spontaneous social behavior through a face-to-face interaction, in which a mother was required to maintain a normal interaction to amuse her baby for 2 minutes (a baseline episode) and then suddenly change to the no-reaction and no-expression status with 1 minute (a still-face episode). Here, multiple cues derived from baby's social stress response behavior during the latter episode, including head-movements, facial expressions and vocal characteristics, were statistically analyzed between HR-ASD and typical developmental (TD) groups. An automated identification model of HR-ASD was constructed based on these multi-cue features and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier; moreover, its screening performance was satisfied, for all the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity exceeded 90% on the cases included in this study. The experimental results suggest its feasibility in the early screening of HR-ASD.",

      "abstract": "Recently, facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild has gained a lot of researchers' attention because it is a valuable topic to enable the FER techniques to move from the laboratory to the real applications. In this paper, we focus on this challenging but interesting topic and make contributions from three aspects. First, we present a new large-scale 'in-the-wild' dynamic facial expression database, DFEW (Dynamic Facial Expression in the Wild), consisting of over 16,000 video clips from thousands of movies. These video clips contain various challenging interferences in practical scenarios such as extreme illumination, occlusions, and capricious pose changes. Second, we propose a novel method called Expression-Clustered Spatiotemporal Feature Learning (EC-STFL) framework to deal with dynamic FER in the wild. Third, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on DFEW using a lot of spatiotemporal deep feature learning methods as well as our proposed EC-STFL. Experimental results show that DFEW is a well-designed and challenging database, and the proposed EC-STFL can promisingly improve the performance of existing spatiotemporal deep neural networks in coping with the problem of dynamic FER in the wild. Our DFEW database is publicly available and can be freely downloaded from https://dfew-dataset.github.io/.",

Inspired by this study, in this article, we propose a novel bi-hemispheric discrepancy model (BiHDM) to learn this discrepancy information between the two hemispheres to improve electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition. Concretely, we first employ four directed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based on two spatial orientations to traverse electrode signals on two separate brain regions. This enables the proposed model to obtain the deep representations of all the EEG electrodes' signals that keep their intrinsic spatial dependence. Upon this representation, a pairwise subnetwork is designed to explicitly capture the discrepancy information between the two hemispheres and extract higher level features for final classification. Furthermore, considering the presence of the domain shift between training and testing data, we incorporate a domain discriminator that adversarially induces the overall feature learning module to generate emotion related but domain-invariant feature representation so as to further promote EEG emotion recognition. Experiments are conducted on three public EEG emotional data sets, in which we evaluate the performance of the proposed BiHDM as well as investigated the important brain areas in emotion expression and explore to use less electrodes to achieve comparable results. These experimental results jointly demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed BiHDM model in solving the EEG emotion recognition problem.",

      "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition has recently attracted much interest due to the widespread of multimedia data. It generally involves two basic problems: 1) feature extraction and 2) emotion classification. Most previous algorithms just focus on solving one of these two problems. In this article, we aim to deal with these two problems in a joint learning framework, and present a novel regression algorithm, namely, robust discriminative sparse regression (RDSR). In RDSR, we propose a sparse regression algorithm to make our model robust to outliers and noises, and introduce a feature selection regularization constraint simultaneously to select the most discriminative and relevant features. In addition, to well predict the labels, we exploit the local and global consistency over labels, and incorporate it into the proposed framework. To solve the objective function of RDSR, we design an efficient alternative optimization algorithm. Finally, experimental results on several public emotion data sets verify the effectiveness and the superiority of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Cross-database micro-expression recognition (CDMER) is one of recently emerging and interesting problem in micro-expression analysis. CDMER is more challenging than the conventional micro-expression recognition (MER), because the training and testing samples in CDMER come from different micro-expression databases, resulting in inconsistency of the feature distributions between the training and testing sets. In this paper, we contribute to this topic from three aspects. First, we establish a CDMER experimental evaluation protocol aiming to allow the researchers to conveniently work on this topic and evaluate their proposed methods under the same standard. Second, we conduct benchmark experiments by using NINE state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) methods and SIX popular spatiotemporal descriptors for investigating CDMER problem from two different perspectives. Third, we propose a novel DA method called region selective transfer regression (RSTR) to deal with the CDMER task. The overall superior performance of RSTR over the state-of-the-art DA methods demonstrates that taking into consideration the facial local region information used in RSTR contributes to developing effective DA methods for dealing with CDMER problem.",

      "abstract": "To tackle the individual differences and characterize the dynamic relationships among different EEG regions for EEG emotion recognition, in this paper, we propose a novel instance-adaptive graph method (IAG), which employs a more flexible way to construct graphic connections so as to present different graphic representations determined by different input instances. To fit the different EEG pattern, we employ an additional branch to characterize the intrinsic dynamic relationships between different EEG channels. To give a more precise graphic representation, we design the multi-level and multi-graph convolutional operation and the graph coarsening. Furthermore, we present a type of sparse graphic representation to extract more discriminative features. Experiments on two widely-used EEG emotion recognition datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed model and the experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Research on human emotion cognition revealed that connections and pathways exist between spatially-adjacent and functional-related areas during emotion expression (Adolphs 2002a; Bullmore and Sporns 2009). Deeply inspired by this mechanism, we propose a heuristic Variational Pathway Reasoning (VPR) method to deal with EEG-based emotion recognition. We introduce random walk to generate a large number of candidate pathways along electrodes. To encode each pathway, the dynamic sequence model is further used to learn between-electrode dependencies. The encoded pathways around each electrode are aggregated to produce a pseudo maximum-energy pathway, which consists of the most important pair-wise connections. To find those most salient connections, we propose a sparse variational scaling (SVS) module to learn scaling factors of pseudo pathways by using the Bayesian probabilistic process and sparsity constraint, where the former endows good generalization ability while the latter favors adaptive pathway selection. Finally, the salient pathways from those candidates are jointly decided by the pseudo pathways and scaling factors. Extensive experiments on EEG emotion recognition demonstrate that the proposed VPR is superior to those state-of-the-art methods, and could find some interesting pathways w.r.t. different emotions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Automatic facial expression coding of infants plays an important role in infants-related applications, including computer-aided ASD diagnosis, automatic intervention for ASD children and diagnosis of ADHD, etc. However, most of existing facial expression researches focused on adult facial expression analysis, the infant facial expression recognition has been less investigated. Due to an age gap between the facial expression datasets of adults and infants, a facial expression recognition model trained on adult datasets usually shows poor generalization to infants datasets. A labeled infant facial expression dataset can mitigate this problem, and hence we first collect a facial expression dataset of 30 infants under 24 months of age by recording videos of infants’ facial expression during a face-to-face mother-infant interaction. Due to infants spontaneous facial behaviors, the dataset covers multiple challenges, such as large head-poses, occlusion, facial expression intensities, etc. To develop an automatic facial expression coding system, we propose a framework consisted of adaptive region learning and island loss, i.e., ARL-IL, to self-adaptively discover facial regions with higher discriminability between different emotion classes. The framework was verified on our collected dataset, and attained a classification accuracy of 86.86%, which has shown better performance than conventional method based on hand-crafted features and some basic CNN architectures. To interpret the effectiveness of ARL-IL, we also visualize the learned features and find that the proposed framework focuses on facial regions with more emotion information compared with other hand-crafted features or learned features from basic CNN architectures. The experimental results show that our proposed framework has robustness to the large head-poses and occlusion.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, we propose a novel deep domain-adaptive convolutional neural network (DDACNN) model to handle the challenging cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) problem. The framework of the DDACNN model consists of two components: a feature extraction model based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a domain-adaptive (DA) layer added in the DCNN utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) criterion. We use labeled spectrograms from source speech corpus combined with unlabeled spectrograms from target speech corpus as the input of two classic DCNNs to extract the emotional features of speech, and train the model with a special mixed loss combined with a cross-entrophy loss and an MMD loss. Compared to other classic cross-corpus SER methods, the major advantage of the DDACNN model is that it can extract robust speech features which are time-frequency related by spectrograms and narrow the discrepancies between feature distribution of source corpus and target corpus to get better cross-corpus performance. Through several cross-corpus SER experiments, our DDACNN achieved the state-of-the-art performance on three public emotion speech corpora and is proved to handle the cross-corpus SER problem efficiently.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we will investigate skeleton-based action recognition by employing high-order statistics feature and first-order statistics feature, where the high-order statistics feature is characterized by symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Noting that SPD matrices are theoretically embedded on Riemannian manifolds, we propose an end-to-end deep manifold-to-manifold transforming network (DMT-Net), which can make SPD matrices flow from one Riemannian manifold to another one for facilitating the action recognition task. To learn discriminative SPD features from both spatial and temporal dependencies, we propose a neural network model with three novel layers on manifolds: i.e., (1) the local SPD convolutional layer, (2) the non-linear SPD activation layer, and (3) the Riemannian-preserved recursive layer. The SPD property is preserved through all layers without the singular value decomposition (SVD) operation, which has to be conducted in the existing methods with expensive computation cost. Furthermore, a diagonalizing SPD layer is designed to efficiently calculate the final metric for the classification task. Finally, DMT-Net is further fused with a first order layer to capture temporal evolution information. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the task of action recognition, where the input signals are represented as SPD matrices. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive over state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Graph classification is a fundamental but challenging issue for numerous real-world applications. Despite recent great progress in image/video classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot yet cater to graphs well because of graphical non-Euclidean topology. In this article, we propose a walk-steered convolutional (WSC) network to assemble the essential success of standard CNNs, as well as the powerful representation ability of random walk. Instead of deterministic neighbor searching used in previous graphical CNNs, we construct multiscale walk fields (a.k.a. local receptive fields) with random walk paths to depict subgraph structures and advocate graph scalability. To express the internal variations of a walk field, Gaussian mixture models are introduced to encode the principal components of walk paths therein. As an analogy to a standard convolution kernel on image, Gaussian models implicitly coordinate those unordered vertices/nodes and edges in a local receptive field after projecting to the gradient space of Gaussian parameters. We further stack graph coarsening upon Gaussian encoding by using dynamic clustering, such that high-level semantics of graph can be well learned like the conventional pooling on image. The experimental results on several public data sets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed WSC method over many state of the arts for graph classification.",

In this paper, we propose a Target-adapted Subspace Learning (TaSL) method for cross-corpus SER. The TaSL method trys to find a projection subspace, where the feature regress the label more accurately and the gap of feature distributions in target and source domains is bridged effectively. Then, in order to obtain more optimal projection matrix, ℓ1 norm and ℓ2,1 norm penalty terms are added to different regularization terms, respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public corpuses, EmoDB, eNTERFACE and AFEW 4.0. The experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods in the cross-corpus SER tasks.",

      "abstract": "In a social world, observing the actions of others is fundamental to understanding what they are doing, as well as their intentions and feelings. Studies of the neural basis and decoding of action observation are important for understanding action-related processes and have implications for cognitive, social neuroscience, and human-machine interaction (HMI). In the current study, we first investigated temporal-spatial dynamics during action observation using a combined 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and 48-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. We measured brain activation while 16 healthy participants observed three action tasks: (1) grasping a cup with the intention of drinking; (2) grasping a cup with the intention of moving it; and (3) touching a cup with an unclear intention. The EEG and fNIRS source analysis results revealed the dynamic involvement of both the mirror neuron system (MNS) and the theory of mind (ToM)/mentalizing network during action observation. The source analysis results suggested that the extent to which these two systems were engaged was determined by the clarity of the intention of the observed action. Based on the difference in neural activity observed among different action-observation tasks in the first experiment, we conducted a second experiment to classify the neural processes underlying action observation using a feature classification method. We constructed complex brain networks based on the EEG and fNIRS data. Fusing features from both EEG and fNIRS complex brain networks resulted in a classification accuracy of 72.7% for the three action observation tasks. This study provides a theoretical and empirical basis for elucidating the neural mechanisms of action observation and intention understanding, and a feasible method for decoding the underlying neural processes.",

      "abstract": "The emotion recognition in the wild has been a hot research topic in the field of affective computing. Though some progresses have been achieved, the emotion recognition in the wild is still an unsolved problem due to the challenge of head movement, face deformation, illumination variation etc. To deal with these unconstrained challenges, we propose a bi-modality fusion method for video based emotion recognition in the wild. The proposed framework takes advantages of the visual information from facial expression sequences and the speech information from audio. The state-of-the-art CNN based object recognition models are employed to facilitate the facial expression recognition performance. A bi-direction long short term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is employed to capture dynamic information of the learned features. Additionally, to take full advantages of the facial expression information, the VGG16 network is trained on AffectNet dataset to learn a specialized facial expression recognition model. On the other hand, the audio based features, like low level descriptor (LLD) and deep features obtained by spectrogram image, are also developed to improve the emotion recognition performance. The best experimental result shows that the overall accuracy of our algorithm on the Test dataset of the EmotiW challenge is 62.78, which outperforms the best result of EmotiW2018 and ranks 2nd at the EmotiW2019 challenge.",

      "abstract": "Most daily acts, like sequential finger tapping and typewriting, are conducted with rare (if any) attentional or conscious guidance. Whereas, such automaticity must be available for revamp by deliberate attention in order to learn new skills. It yet remains elusive that attention may interact with automatic movements. Here we tackled this issue by quantifying the fast finger tapping movement to examine how selective attention interfere with automaticity. For Participants (N=16 for each experiment, all right-handed), tapping movements were recorded by 60HZ cameras and trajectories of the right-hand fingertips were extracted by DeepLabCut (Mathis et al., 2018), a video-based pose estimation toolbox. In Exp1 we used a dual-task paradigm to examine the effect of covert attention on automatic movement. While participants were watching the visual display and continuously tapping by four fingers, their covert attention were required to be allocated on the movement of the index finger (INDEX), the middle finger (MID), evenly distributed across all moving fingers (WHOLE) or exclusively on the letter counting task only (CTRL). Results reveal that 1) inter-finger synchrony was highest in CTRL, lowest in WHOLE, and intermediate in INDEX and MID. 2) inter-trial synchrony was reduced for all the attended fingers in INDEX, MID and WHOLE relative to the CTRL, and no significant changes were found for unattended fingers. All these effects have been well replicated in Exp2, in which we further examined the effect of overt attention by intentionally keeping eyes on the target finger(s) while neglecting the others. Exp3 further concluded that these effects cannot be artifacts of conceptual priming of targeted finger(s) since attending to the finger labels in the working memory instead of the movement while tapping made no attentional effects. Taken together, evidences here indicate intrinsic interactions between attentional allocation and automatic movements.",

      "abstract": "A brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a novel non-muscular communication pathway for individuals with severe neuromuscular diseases. BCI systems based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) have high classification accuracy, information transfer rate, and signal-to-noise ratio, giving them high research and application value. However, SSVEP-based BCI has several limitations in real-world applications. The main challenge is how to reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated training process while maintaining high classification accuracy. Filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) is a powerful and widely used feature extraction method for SSVEP-based BCI systems. However, the reference signals of FBCCA are fixed-frequency sine-cosine waves, which makes it difficult to accurately describe the complex, mutative, and individually different physiological SSVEPs. Therefore, there is huge room for improvement in classification performance based on the FBCCA method. In contrast, although spatiotemporal beamforming (BF) detects SSVEPs with high accuracy, it needs an additional training process, which limits its application. In this study, we propose a bimodal decoding algorithm (FBCCA+BF), which combines the advantages of the training-free classification of FBCCA and the data-driven and adaptive features of BF. Six-channel SSVEP data corresponding to eight targets measured from 15 subjects were used to test the effectiveness of three different CCA-based methods, BF, and our proposed FBCCA+BF methods. It was found that the classification accuracies for BF and FBCCA+BF are 95.6% and 92.2%, respectively, which are significantly higher than the other CCA-based methods. Notably, both BF and FBCCA+BF obtain state-of-the-art performance, but FBCCA+BF does this without the need for a dedicated training process. Therefore, we conclude that our proposed FBCCA+BF method provides a training-free and high-accuracy approach for SSVEP-based BCIs.",

      "abstract": "Over the past several years, the research of micro-expression recognition (MER) has become an active topic in affective computing and computer vision because of its potential value in many application fields, e.g., lie detection. However, most previous works assumed an ideal scenario that both training and testing samples belong to the same micro-expression database, which is easily broken in practice. In this letter, we hence consider a more challenging scenario that the training and testing samples come from different micro-expression databases and investigated unsupervised cross-database MER in which the source database is labeled while the label information of target database is entirely unseen. To solve this interesting problem, we propose an effective method called target-adapted least-squares regression (TALSR). The basic idea of TALSR is to learn a regression coefficient matrix based on the source samples and their provided label information and also enable this learned regression coefficient matrix to suit the target micro-expression database. We are thus able to use the learned regression coefficient matrix to predict the micro-expression categories of the target micro-expression samples. Extensive experiments on CASME II and SMIC micro-expression databases are conducted to evaluate the proposed TALSR. The experimental results show that our TALSR has better performance than lots of recent well-performing domain adaptation methods in dealing with unsupervised cross-database MER tasks.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel Electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition method inspired by neuroscience with respect to the brain response to different emotions. The proposed method, denoted by R2G-STNN, consists of spatial and temporal neural network models with regional to global hierarchical feature learning process to learn discriminative spatial-temporal EEG features. To learn the spatial features, a bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) network is adopted to capture the intrinsic spatial relationships of EEG electrodes within brain region and between brain regions, respectively. Considering that different brain regions play different roles in the EEG emotion recognition, a region-attention layer into the R2G-STNN model is also introduced to learn a set of weights to strengthen or weaken the contributions of brain regions. Based on the spatial feature sequences, BiLSTM is adopted to learn both regional and global spatial-temporal features and the features are fitted into a classifier layer for learning emotion-discriminative features, in which a domain discriminator working corporately with the classifier is used to decrease the domain shift between training and testing data. Finally, to evaluate the proposed method, we conduct both subject-dependent and subject-independent EEG emotion recognition experiments on SEED database, and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Recently, microexpression recognition has attracted a lot of researchers' attention due to its challenges and valuable applications. However, it is noticed that currently most of the existing proposed methods are often evaluated and tested on the single database and, hence, this brings us a question whether these methods are still effective if the training and testing samples belong to different domains, for example, different microexpression databases. In this case, a large feature distribution difference may exist between training (source) and testing (target) samples and, hence, microexpression recognition tasks would become more difficult. To solve this challenging problem, that is, cross-domain microexpression recognition, in this paper, we propose an effective method consisting of an auxiliary set selection model (ASSM) and a transductive transfer regression model (TTRM). In our method, an ASSM is designed to automatically select an optimal set of samples from the target domain to serve as the auxiliary set, which is used for subsequent TTRM training. As for TTRM, it aims at bridging the feature distribution gap between the source and target domains by learning a joint regression model with the source domain samples and the auxiliary set selected from the target domain. We evaluate the proposed TTRM plus ASSM by extensive cross-domain microexpression recognition experiments on SMIC and CASME II databases. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, our proposed method has a more satisfactory performance in dealing with the cross-domain microexpression recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "Cross-database micro-expression recognition (CDMER) is one of recently emerging and interesting problems in micro-expression analysis. CDMER is more challenging than the conventional micro-expression recognition (MER), because the training and testing samples in CDMER come from different micro-expression databases, resulting in inconsistency of the feature distributions between the training and testing sets. In this paper, we contribute to this topic from two aspects. First, we establish a CDMER experimental evaluation protocol and provide a standard platform for evaluating their proposed methods. Second, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments by using NINE state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) methods and SIX popular spatiotemporal descriptors for investigating the CDMER problem from two different perspectives and deeply analyze and discuss the experimental results. In addition, all the data and codes involving CDMER in this paper are released on our project website: http://aip.seu.edu.cn/cdmer.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression is one type of special facial expressions and usually occurs when people try to hide their true emotions. Therefore, recognizing micro-expressions has potential values in lots of applications, e.g., lie detection. In this letter, we focus on such a meaningful topic and investigate how to make full advantage of the color information provided by the micro-expression samples to deal with the micro-expression recognition (MER) problem. To this end, we propose a novel method called color space fusion learning (CSFL) model to fuse the spatiotemporal features extracted in different color space such that the fused spatiotemporal features would be better at describing micro-expressions. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed CSFL method, extensive MER experiments on a widely-used spatiotemporal micro-expression database SMIC is conducted. The experimental results show that the CSFL can significantly improve the performance of spatiotemporal features in coping with MER tasks.",

      "abstract": "A three-level buck (TLB) converter has the characteristics of higher voltage conversion efficiency, lower inductor current ripples, output voltage ripples and voltage stresses on switches when compared with the buck converters in continuous conduction mode (CCM). With a TLB converter integrated on a chip, we cannot avoid its discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation due to a smaller inductance and load variation. In this paper, we’ll present and discuss the analysis, design and control of a TLB converter under DCM operation, implemented in a 65[Formula: see text]nm CMOS process. Transistor level simulation results show that when the TLB converter operates at 100[Formula: see text]MHz with a 5[Formula: see text]nH on-chip inductor, a 10[Formula: see text]nF output capacitor and a 10[Formula: see text]nF flying capacitor, it can achieve an output conversion range of 0.7–1.2[Formula: see text]V from a 2.4[Formula: see text]V input supply, with a peak efficiency of 81.5%@120[Formula: see text]mW. The output load transient response is 100[Formula: see text]mV with 101[Formula: see text]ns for undershoot, and 86[Formula: see text]mV with 110[Formula: see text]ns for overshoot when [Formula: see text]–100[Formula: see text]mA. The maximum output voltage ripple is less than 19[Formula: see text]mV.",

      "abstract": "Objective To explore the characteristics of social behaviors in toddlers with high-risk of autism spectrum disorder (HR-ASD), and the correlation to the severity of ASD symptoms. Method 32 high-risk ASD toddlers, aged from 12 months to 24 months, and 34 typical developmental (TD) infants/toddlers, aged from 6 months to 24 months, were recruited. Behavioral video of the Still-Face Paradigm (SFP) was used to measure the frequencies and duration of social behaviors, including non-social smiling, protest, eye contact, social smiling and social positive engagement, during the mother-infant interaction and the still face. Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale was used to evaluate severity of clinical symptoms in high-risk ASD toddler. Gesell Development Scale was used to assess the developmental level of the two groups. Independent-sample t test was used to compare the differences of social behaviors between two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between the social behaviors of high-risk ASD and the age, the developmental level and the severity of ASD symptoms. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the power of discrimination of social behaviors between HR-ASD and TD. Results During mother-infant interaction, compared with TD group, HR-ASD had significantly shorter duration ((19.8±23.4) s vs.(61.5±34.0) s, t=-5.75, P<0.01; (6.5±9.3) s vs. (29.0±25.2) s, t=-4.73, P<0.01; (3.0±8.8) s vs. (13.2±23.1) s, t=-2.34, P=0.02) and lower frequencies (t=-6.62、-3.03、-2.74, all P<0.01) of eye contact, social smiling and social positive engagement. During the still face, compared with TD group, HR-ASD had significantly shorter duration (t=-3.32, P<0.01; t=-2.59, P=0.01) and lower frequencies (t= -6.13、-3.48, all P<0.01) of eye contact and social positive engagement. According to Pearson correlation analysis, during the still face, in HR-ASD group, the duration of eye contact and social positive engagement had significantly negative influence on the score of the language and communication in ADOS (r=-0.49、-0.52, all P<0.01); The duration and frequencies of eye contact and social positive engagement had significantly negative influence on the score of mutually social interaction in ADOS (r=-0.57, P<0.01; r= -0.49, P<0.01; r=-0.74, P<0.01; r=-0.44, P=0.01); The duration of eye contact and social positive engagement had significantly negative influence on the score of the playing in ADOS (r=-0.43, P=0.01; r=-0.45, P=0.01). According to binary logistic regression, the duration of social smiling during the still face and the frequencies of eye contact during mother-infant interaction could distinguish between HR-ASD and TD (OR=1.36, 95%CI: 1.08-1.71, P=0.01; OR=5.99, 95%CI: 1.15-31.14, P=0.03). Conclusion HR-ASD hasthe lower levels of eye contact, social smiling and social positive engagement, which may suggestthe severity of ASD core symptoms. The duration of social smiling during the still face and the frequencies of eye contact during mother-infant interaction may possiblyfigure out theHR-ASD and could be further developed as a predictablebehavioral maker.

      "abstract": "Local binary descriptors, such as local binary pattern (LBP) and its various variants, have been studied extensively in texture and dynamic texture analysis due to their outstanding characteristics, such as grayscale invariance, low computational complexity and good discriminability. Most existing local binary feature extraction methods extract spatio-temporal features from three orthogonal planes of a spatio-temporal volume by viewing a dynamic texture in 3D space. For a given pixel in a video, only a proportion of its surrounding pixels is incorporated in the local binary feature extraction process. We argue that the ignored pixels contain discriminative information that should be explored. To fully utilize the information conveyed by all the pixels in a local neighborhood, we propose extracting local binary features from the spatio-temporal domain with 3D filters that are learned in an unsupervised manner so that the discriminative features along both the spatial and temporal dimensions are captured simultaneously. The proposed approach consists of three components: 1) 3D filtering; 2) binary hashing; and 3) joint histogramming. Densely sampled 3D blocks of a dynamic texture are first normalized to have zero mean and are then filtered by 3D filters that are learned in advance. To preserve more of the structure information, the filter response vectors are decomposed into two complementary components, namely, the signs and the magnitudes, which are further encoded separately into binary codes. The local mean pixels of the 3D blocks are also converted into binary codes. Finally, three types of binary codes are combined via joint or hybrid histograms for the final feature representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on three commonly used dynamic texture databases: 1) UCLA; 2) DynTex; and 3) YUVL. The proposed method provides comparable results to, and even outperforms, many state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "To explore human emotions, in this paper, we design and build a multi-modal physiological emotion database, which collects four modal physiological signals, i.e., electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin response, respiration, and electrocardiogram (ECG). To alleviate the influence of culture dependent elicitation materials and evoke desired human emotions, we specifically collect an emotion elicitation material database selected from more than 1500 video clips. By the considerable amount of strict man-made labeling, we elaborately choose 28 videos as standardized elicitation samples, which are assessed by psychological methods. The physiological signals of participants were synchronously recorded when they watched these standardized video clips that described six discrete emotions and neutral emotion. With three types of classification protocols, different feature extraction methods and classifiers (support vector machine and k-NearestNeighbor) were used to recognize the physiological responses of different emotions, which presented the baseline results. Simultaneously, we present a novel attention-long short-term memory (A-LSTM), which strengthens the effectiveness of useful sequences to extract more discriminative features. In addition, correlations between the EEG signals and the participants' ratings are investigated. The database has been made publicly available to encourage other researchers to use it to evaluate their own emotion estimation methods.",

In this paper, we propose a three-stream convolutional neural network (TSCNN) to recognize MEs by learning ME-discriminative features in three key frames of ME videos. We design a dynamic-temporal stream, static-spatial stream, and local-spatial stream module for the TSCNN that respectively attempt to learn and integrate temporal, entire facial region, and facial local region cues in ME videos with the goal of recognizing MEs. In addition, to allow the TSCNN to recognize MEs without using the index values of apex frames, we design a reliable apex frame detection algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted with five public ME databases: CASME II, SMIC-HS, SAMM, CAS(ME)<sup>2</sup>, and CASME. Our proposed TSCNN is shown to achieve more promising recognition results when compared with many other methods.",

As part of the network parameters, the labels of the target samples are also optimized when optimizing the parameters of TDTLN, such that the cross-entropy loss of source domain data and the regression loss of target domain data can be simultaneously calculated. Finally, to evaluate the recognition performance of the proposed TDTLN method, we conduct extensive cross-database experiments on four commonly used multi-view facial expression databases, namely the BU-3DEF, Multi-PIE, SFEW, and RAF database. The experimental results show that the proposed TDTLN method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Whispering is a special pronunciation style in which the vocal cords do not vibrate. Compared with voiced speech, whispering is noise-like because of the lack of a fundamental frequency. The energy of whispered speech is approximately 20 dB lower than that of voiced speech. Converting whispering into normal speech is an effective way to improve speech quality and/or intelligibility. In this paper, we propose a whisper-to-normal speech conversion method based on a sequence-to-sequence framework combined with an auditory attention mechanism. The proposed method does not require time aligning before conversion training, which makes it more applicable to real scenarios. In addition, the fundamental frequency is estimated from the mel frequency cepstral coefficients estimated by the proposed sequence-to-sequence framework. The voiced speech converted by the proposed method has appropriate length, which is determined adaptively by the proposed sequence-to-sequence model according to the source whispered speech. Experimental results show that the proposed sequence-to-sequence whisper-to-normal speech conversion method outperforms conventional DTW-based methods.",

      "abstract": "Visual object tracking is a challenging computer vision task with numerous real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient Spectral Filter Tracking (SFT) method from the view of graph, where each candidate image region is modeled as a pixelwise grid graph. Instead of the conventional graph matching, we formulate the tracking as a plain least square regression problem of learning spectral filters on graphs to predict an optimal vertex, which indicates the center of the target. To bypass computationally expensive eigenvalue decomposition on graph Laplacian L, we parameterize spectral graph filters as a polynomial of L to aggregate local graph features according to spectral graph theory, in which Lk exactly encodes a k-hop local neighborhood of each vertex. Thus, different from the holistic regression in those correlation filter based methods, SFT can operate on localized regions around a pixel (i.e., a vertex), which can effectively reduce the influence of local variations and cluttered backgrounds. Furthermore, we observe that the correlation filter tracking may be viewed as a specific case of our proposed spectral filtering method. The implementation of SFT can simply boil down to only a few line codes, but surprisingly it beats the correlation filter based model with the same feature input, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on OTB-2015 and VOT2016 under the same feature extraction strategy.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model, called bi-hemisphere domain adversarial neural network (BiDANN) model, for electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition. The BiDANN model is inspired by the neuroscience findings that the left and right hemispheres of human's brain are asymmetric to the emotional response. It contains a global and two local domain discriminators that work adversarially with a classifier to learn discriminative emotional features for each hemisphere. At the same time, it tries to reduce the possible domain differences in each hemisphere between the source and target domains so as to improve the generality of the recognition model. In addition, we also propose an improved version of BiDANN, denoted by BiDANN-S, for subject-independent EEG emotion recognition problem by lowering the influences of the personal information of subjects to the EEG emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on the SEED database are conducted to evaluate the performance of both BiDANN and BiDANN-S. The experimental results have shown that the proposed BiDANN and BiDANN models achieve state-of-the-art performance in the EEG emotion recognition.",

In this paper, we proposed a novel transductive deep transfer learning architecture based on widely used VGGface16-Net for this problem. In this framework, the VGGface16-Net is used to jointly learn an common optimal nonlinear discriminative features from the non-frontal facial expression samples between the source and target databases and then we design a novel transductive transfer layer to deal with the cross-database non-frontal facial expression classification task. In order to validate the performance of the proposed transductive deep transfer learning networks, we present extensive crossdatabase experiments on two famous available facial expression databases, namely the BU-3DEF and the Multi-PIE database. The final experimental results show that our transductive deep transfer network outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-database facial expression recognition methods.",

      "abstract": "Smile is one of the most frequently appeared facial expressions of human beings. It is an explicit social signal to speculate on humans' emotion. Interpretation of infants smile behavior has received much attention in the field of psychology and pediatric medicine, i.e. Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD). Due to low efficiency of manual emotion encoding of infant facial images, automatic smile detection system has drawn many researchers' attention. However, lack of large amount of labeled data hinders the research progress in this field. In this paper, a novel dataset named RCLA&NBH\\_Smile Dataset was presented. Thirty four infants facial expression videos were recorded during mother-infant interaction and over 77,000 frames were manually labeled. For developing an automatic smile analysis system, we proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method for smile detection. We firstly evaluated our proposed method on two public datasets, GENKI-4K and CelebA, and it achieved satisfactory result of mean accuracy of 94.55% and 92.60%, respectively. Experiments on RCLA&NBH\\_Smile dataset show that our proposed approach can achieve the mean accuracy of 87.16% and F1-score of 62.54%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Visual relationship detection can bridge the gap between computer vision and\\nnatural language for scene understanding of images. Different from pure object\\nrecognition tasks, the relation triplets of subject-predicate-object lie on an\\nextreme diversity space, such as \\\\textit{person-behind-person} and\\n\\\\textit{car-behind-building}, while suffering from the problem of combinatorial\\nexplosion. In this paper, we propose a context-dependent diffusion network\\n(CDDN) framework to deal with visual relationship detection. To capture the\\ninteractions of different object instances, two types of graphs, word semantic\\ngraph and visual scene graph, are constructed to encode global context\\ninterdependency. The semantic graph is built through language priors to model\\nsemantic correlations across objects, whilst the visual scene graph defines the\\nconnections of scene objects so as to utilize the surrounding scene\\ninformation. For the graph-structured data, we design a diffusion network to\\nadaptively aggregate information from contexts, which can effectively learn\\nlatent representations of visual relationships and well cater to visual\\nrelationship detection in view of its isomorphic invariance to graphs.\\nExperiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is\\nmore effective and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.\\n",

      "abstract": "The difficulty of emotion recognition in the wild (EmotiW) is how to train a robust model to deal with diverse scenarios and anomalies. The Audio-video Sub-challenge in EmotiW contains audio-video short clips with several emotional labels and the task is to distinguish which label the video belongs to. For the better emotion recognition in videos, we propose a multiple spatio-temporal feature fusion (MSFF) framework, which can more accurately depict emotional information in spatial and temporal dimensions by two mutually complementary sources, including the facial image and audio. The framework is consisted of two parts: the facial image model and the audio model. With respect to the facial image model, three different architectures of spatial-temporal neural networks are employed to extract discriminative features about different emotions in facial expression images. Firstly, the high-level spatial features are obtained by the pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN), including VGG-Face and ResNet-50 which are all fed with the images generated by each video. Then, the features of all frames are sequentially input to the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) so as to capture dynamic variations of facial appearance textures in a video. In addition to the structure of CNN-RNN, another spatio-temporal network, namely deep 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) by extending the 2D convolution kernel to 3D, is also applied to attain evolving emotional information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. For the audio model, the spectrogram images of speech generated by preprocessing audio, are also modeled in a VGG-BLSTM framework to characterize the affective fluctuation more efficiently. Finally, a fusion strategy with the score matrices of different spatio-temporal networks gained from the above framework is proposed to boost the performance of emotion recognition complementally. Extensive experiments show that the overall accuracy of our proposed MSFF is 60.64%, which achieves a large improvement compared with the baseline and outperform the result of champion team in 2017.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep manifold-to-manifold transforming network (DMT-Net), which makes SPD matrices flow from one Riemannian manifold to another more discriminative one. For discriminative feature learning, two specific layers on manifolds are developed: (i) the local SPD convolutional layer, (ii) the non-linear SPD activation layer, where positive definiteness is satisfied for both two layers. Further, to relieve computational burden of kernels on relative large-scale data, we design a batch-kernelized layer to favor batchwise kernel optimization of deep networks. Specifically, one reference set dynamically changing with the network training is introduced to break the limitation of memory size. We evaluate our proposed method on action recognition datasets, where input signals are popularly modeled as SPD matrices. The experimental results demonstrate that our DMT-Net is more competitive than state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Fisher's criterion is one of the most popular discriminant criteria for feature extraction. It is defined as the generalized Rayleigh quotient of the between-class scatter distance to the within-class scatter distance. Consequently, Fisher's criterion does not take advantage of the discriminant information in the class covariance differences, and hence, its discriminant ability largely depends on the class mean differences. If the class mean distances are relatively large compared with the within-class scatter distance, Fisher's criterion-based discriminant analysis methods may achieve a good discriminant performance. Otherwise, it may not deliver good results. Moreover, we observe that the between-class distance of Fisher's criterion is based on the l<sub>2</sub> -norm, which would be disadvantageous to separate the classes with smaller class mean distances. To overcome the drawback of Fisher's criterion, in this paper, we first derive a new discriminant criterion, expressed as a mixture of absolute generalized Rayleigh quotients, based on a Bayes error upper bound estimation, where mixture of Gaussians is adopted to approximate the real distribution of data samples. Then, the criterion is further modified by replacing l<sub>2</sub> -norm with l<sub>1</sub> one to better describe the between-class scatter distance, such that it would be more effective to separate the different classes. Moreover, we propose a novel l<sub>1</sub> -norm heteroscedastic discriminant analysis method based on the new discriminant analysis (L1-HDA/GM) for heteroscedastic feature extraction, in which the optimization problem of L1-HDA/GM can be efficiently solved by using the eigenvalue decomposition approach. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four real data sets and demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model, called bi-hemispheres domain adversarial neural network (BiDANN), for EEG emotion recognition. BiDANN is motivated by the neuroscience findings, i.e., the emotional brain's asymmetries between left and right hemispheres. The basic idea of BiDANN is to map the EEG feature data of both left and right hemispheres into discriminative feature spaces separately, in which the data representations can be classified easily. For further precisely predicting the class labels of testing data, we narrow the distribution shift between training and testing data by using a global and two local domain discriminators, which work adversarially to the classifier to encourage domain-invariant data representations to emerge. After that, the learned classifier from labeled training data can be applied to unlabeled testing data naturally. We conduct two experiments to verify the performance of our BiDANN model on SEED database. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Variations of human body skeletons may be considered as dynamic graphs, which are generic data representation for numerous real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal graph convolution (STGC) approach for assembling the successes of local convolutional filtering and sequence learning ability of autoregressive moving average. To encode dynamic graphs, the constructed multi-scale local graph convolution filters, consisting of matrices of local receptive fields and signal mappings, are recursively performed on structured graph data of temporal and spatial domain. The proposed model is generic and principled as it can be generalized into other dynamic models. We theoretically prove the stability of STGC and provide an upper-bound of the signal transformation to be learnt. Further, the proposed recursive model can be stacked into a multi-layer architecture. To evaluate our model, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark skeleton-based action datasets, including the large-scale challenging NTU RGB+D. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and the improvement over the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "An end-to-end network architecture, the Recurrent Shape Regression (RSR), is presented to deal with the task of facial shape detection, a crucial step in many computer vision problems. The RSR generalizes the conventional cascaded regression into a recurrent dynamic network through abstracting common latent models with stage-to-stage operations. Instead of invariant regression transformation, we construct shape-dependent dynamic regressors to attain the recurrence of regression action itself. The regressors can be stacked into a high-order regression network to represent more complex shape regression. By further integrating feature learning as well as global shape constraint, the RSR becomes more controllable in entire optimization of shape regression, where the gradient computation can be efficiently back-propagated through time. To handle the possible partial occlusions of shapes, we propose a mimic virtual occlusion strategy by randomly disturbing certain point cliques without the requirement of any annotations of occlusion information or even occluded training data. Extensive experiments on five face datasets demonstrate that the proposed RSR outperforms the recent state-of-the-art cascaded approaches.",

      "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition aims to infer genuine emotions that people try to conceal from facial video clips. It is a very challenging task because micro-expressions have a very low intensity and short duration, which makes micro-expressions difficult to observe. Recently, researchers have designed various spatiotemporal descriptors to describe micro-expressions. It is notable that for better capturing the low-intensity facial muscle movement, a fixed spatial division grid, 8× 8 for example, is commonly used to partition the facial images into a few facial blocks before extracting descriptors. However, it is hard to choose an ideal division grid for different micro-expression samples because the division grids affect the discriminative ability of spatiotemporal descriptors to distinguish micro-expressions. To address this problem, in this paper, we design a hierarchical spatial division scheme for spatiotemporal descriptor extraction. By using the proposed scheme, it would not be a problem to determine which division grid is most suitable regarding different micro-expression samples. Furthermore, we propose a kernelized group sparse learning (KGSL) model to process hierarchical scheme based spatiotemporal descriptors such that they are more effective for micro-expression recognition tasks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed micro-expression recognition method consisting of the hierarchical scheme based spatiotemporal descriptors and KGSL, extensive experiments are conducted on two public micro-expression databases: CASME II and SMIC. Compared with many recent state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves more promising recognition results.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel tensor graph convolutional neural network (TGCNN) to conduct convolution on factorizable graphs, for which here two types of problems are focused, one is sequential dynamic graphs and the other is cross-attribute graphs. Especially, we propose a graph preserving layer to memorize salient nodes of those factorized subgraphs, i.e. cross graph convolution and graph pooling. For cross graph convolution, a parameterized Kronecker sum operation is proposed to generate a conjunctive adjacency matrix characterizing the relationship between every pair of nodes across two subgraphs. Taking this operation, then general graph convolution may be efficiently performed followed by the composition of small matrices, which thus reduces high memory and computational burden. Encapsuling sequence graphs into a recursive learning, the dynamics of graphs can be efficiently encoded as well as the spatial layout of graphs. To validate the proposed TGCNN, experiments are conducted on skeleton action datasets as well as matrix completion dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that our method can achieve more competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a multichannel EEG emotion recognition method based on a novel dynamical graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNN) is proposed. The basic idea of the proposed EEG emotion recognition method is to use a graph to model the multichannel EEG features and then perform EEG emotion classification based on this model. Different from the traditional graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) methods, the proposed DGCNN method can dynamically learn the intrinsic relationship between different electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, represented by an adjacency matrix, via training a neural network so as to benefit for more discriminative EEG feature extraction. Then, the learned adjacency matrix is used to learn more discriminative features for improving the EEG emotion recognition. We conduct extensive experiments on the SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and DREAMER dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better recognition performance than the state-of-the-art methods, in which the average recognition accuracy of 90.4 percent is achieved for subject dependent experiment while 79.95 percent for subject independent cross-validation one on the SEED database, and the average accuracies of 86.23, 84.54 and 85.02 percent are respectively obtained for valence, arousal and dominance classifications on the DREAMER database.",

      "abstract": "The motion analysis of human skeletons is crucial for human action recognition, which is one of the most active topics in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end action-attending graphic neural network (A2GNN) for skeleton-based action recognition, in which each irregular skeleton is structured as an undirected attribute graph. To extract high-level semantic representation from skeletons, we perform the local spectral graph filtering on the constructed attribute graphs like the standard image convolution operation. Considering not all joints are informative for action analysis, we design an actionattending layer to detect those salient action units (AUs) by adaptively weighting skeletal joints. Herein the filtering responses are parameterized into a weighting function irrelevant to the order of input nodes. To further encode continuous motion variations, the deep features learnt from skeletal graphs are gathered along consecutive temporal slices and then fed into a recurrent gated network. Finally, the spectral graph filtering, action-attending and recurrent temporal encoding are integrated together to jointly train for the sake of robust action recognition as well as the intelligibility of human actions. To evaluate our A2GNN, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark skeletonbased action datasets, including the large-scale challenging NTU RGB+D dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our network achieves the state-of-the-art performances.",

      "abstract": "Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition has recently received considerable attention due to the widespread existence of various emotional speech. It takes one corpus as the training data aiming to recognize emotions of another corpus, and generally involves two basic problems, i.e., feature matching and feature selection. Many previous works study these two problems independently, or just focus on solving the first problem. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called feature selection based transfer subspace learning (FSTSL), to address these two problems. To deal with the first problem, a latent common subspace is learnt by reducing the difference of different corpora and preserving the important properties. Meanwhile, we adopt the l <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,1</sub> -norm on the projection matrix to deal with the second problem. Besides, to guarantee the subspace to be robust and discriminative, the geometric information of data is exploited simultaneously in the proposed FSTSL framework. Empirical experiments on cross-corpus speech emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve encouraging results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, called spatial-temporal recurrent neural network (STRNN), to integrate the feature learning from both spatial and temporal information of signal sources into a unified spatial-temporal dependency model. In STRNN, to capture those spatially co-occurrent variations of human emotions, a multidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) layer is employed to capture long-range contextual cues by traversing the spatial regions of each temporal slice along different directions. Then a bi-directional temporal RNN layer is further used to learn the discriminative features characterizing the temporal dependencies of the sequences, where sequences are produced from the spatial RNN layer. To further select those salient regions with more discriminative ability for emotion recognition, we impose sparse projection onto those hidden states of spatial and temporal domains to improve the model discriminant ability. Consequently, the proposed two-layer RNN model provides an effective way to make use of both spatial and temporal dependencies of the input signals for emotion recognition. Experimental results on the public emotion datasets of electroencephalogram and facial expression demonstrate the proposed STRNN method is more competitive over those state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Recently, micro-expression recognition has attracted lots of researchers' attention due to its potential value in many practical applications, e.g., lie detection. In this paper, we investigate an interesting and challenging problem in micro-expression recognition, i.e., cross-database micro-expression recognition, in which the training and testing samples come from different micro-expression databases. Under this problem setting, the consistent feature distribution between the training and testing samples originally existing in conventional micro-expression recognition would be seriously broken and hence the performance of most current well-performing micro-expression recognition methods may sharply drop. In order to overcome it, we propose a simple yet effective framework called Domain Regeneration (DR) in this paper. DR framework aims at learning a domain regenerator to regenerate the micro-expression samples from source and target databases respectively such that they can abide by the same or similar feature distributions. Thus, we are able to use the classifier learned based on the labeled source micro-expression samples to predict the label information of the unlabeled target micro-expression samples. To evaluate the proposed DR framework, we conduct extensive cross-database micro-expression recognition experiments designed based on SMIC and CASME II databases. Experimental results show that compared with recent state-of-the-art cross-database emotion recognition methods, the proposed DR framework has more promising performance.",

The spatial dependencies of different spatial facial regions are worth exploring and can improve the performance of facial expression recognition. In this letter we propose a joint convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory (JCBLSTM) framework to model the discriminative facial textures and spatial relations between different regions jointly. We treat each row or column of feature maps output from CNN as individual ordered sequence and employ LSTM to model the spatial dependencies within it. Moreover, a shortcut connection for convolutional feature maps is introduced for joint feature representation. We conduct experiments on two databases to evaluate the proposed JCBLSTM method. The experimental results demonstrate that the JCBLSTM method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Multi-PIE and very competitive result on FER-2013.",

      "abstract": "A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication approach that permits cerebral activity to control computers or external devices. Brain electrical activity recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) is most commonly used for BCI. Noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) is a data-driven time-frequency analysis method that can be applied to nonlinear and nonstationary EEG signals for BCI data processing. However, because white Gaussian noise occupies a broad range of frequencies, some redundant components are introduced. To solve this leakage problem, in this study, we propose using a sinusoidal assisted signal that occupies the same frequency ranges as the original signals to improve MEMD performance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed sinusoidal signal assisted MEMD (SA-MEMD) method, we compared the decomposition performances of MEMD, NA-MEMD, and the proposed SA-MEMD using synthetic signals and a real-world BCI dataset. The spectral decomposition results indicate that the proposed SA-MEMD can avoid the generation of redundant components and over decomposition, thus, substantially reduce the mode mixing and misalignment that occurs in MEMD and NA-MEMD. Moreover, using SA-MEMD as a signal preprocessing method instead of MEMD or NA-MEMD can significantly improve BCI classification accuracy and reduce calculation time, which indicates that SA-MEMD is a powerful spectral decomposition method for BCI.",

To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method called Target Sample Re-Generator (TSRG) in this paper. By using TSRG, we are able to re-generate the samples from target micro-expression database and the re-generated target samples would share same or similar feature distributions with the original source samples. For this reason, we can then use the classifier learned based on the labeled source samples to accurately predict the micro-expression categories of the unlabeled target samples. To evaluate the performance of the proposed TSRG method, extensive cross-database micro-expression recognition experiments designed based on SMIC and CASME II databases are conducted. Compared with recent state-of-the-art cross-database emotion recognition methods, the proposed TSRG achieves more promising results.",

      "abstract": "Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices (e.g., covariances, graph Laplacians, etc.) are widely used to model the relationship of spatial or temporal domain. Nevertheless, SPD matrices are theoretically embedded on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep manifold-to-manifold transforming network (DMT-Net) which can make SPD matrices flow from one Riemannian manifold to another more discriminative one. To learn discriminative SPD features characterizing both spatial and temporal dependencies, we specifically develop three novel layers on manifolds: (i) the local SPD convolutional layer, (ii) the non-linear SPD activation layer, and (iii) the Riemannian-preserved recursive layer. The SPD property is preserved through all layers without any requirement of singular value decomposition (SVD), which is often used in the existing methods with expensive computation cost. Furthermore, a diagonalizing SPD layer is designed to efficiently calculate the final metric for the classification task. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the task of action recognition, where input signals are popularly modeled as SPD matrices. The experimental results demonstrate that our DMT-Net is much more competitive over state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Automatic Facial Action Unit (AU) detection has drawn more and more attention over the past years due to its significance to facial expression analysis. Frontal-view AU detection has been extensively evaluated, but cross-pose AU detection is a less-touched problem due to the scarcity of the related dataset. The challenge of Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis (FERA2017) just released a large-scale videobased AU detection dataset across different facial poses. To deal with this challenging task, we develop a simple and efficient deep learning based system to detect AU occurrence under nine different facial views. In this system, we first crop out facial images by using morphology operations including binary segmentation, connected components labeling and region boundaries extraction, then for each type of AU, we train a corresponding expert network by specifically fine-tuning the VGG-Face network on cross-view facial images, so as to extract more discriminative features for the subsequent binary classification. In the AU detection sub-challenge, our proposed method achieves the mean accuracy of 77.8% (vs. the baseline 56.1%), and promotes the F1 score to 57.4% (vs. the baseline 45.2%).",

      "abstract": "As a hot topic of speech signal processing, speech emotion recognition methods have been developed rapidly in recent years. Some satisfactory results have been achieved. However, it should be noted that most of these methods are trained and evaluated on the same corpus. In reality, the training data and testing data are often collected from different corpora, and the feature distributions of different datasets often follow different distributions. These discrepancies will greatly affect the recognition performance. To tackle this problem, a novel corpus-invariant discriminant feature representation algorithm, called transfer discriminant analysis (TDA), is presented for speech emotion recognition. The basic idea of TDA is to integrate the kernel LDA algorithm and the similarity measurement of distributions into one objective function. Experimental results under the cross-corpus conditions show that our proposed method can significantly improve the recognition rates.",

      "abstract": "In the past three years, Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) Grand Challenge has drawn more and more attention due to its huge potential applications. In the fourth challenge, aimed at the task of video based emotion recognition, we propose a multi-clue emotion fusion (MCEF) framework by modeling human emotion from three mutually complementary sources, facial appearance texture, facial action, and audio. To extract high-level emotion features from sequential face images, we employ a CNN-RNN architecture, where face image from each frame is first fed into the fine-tuned VGG-Face network to extract face feature, and then the features of all frames are sequentially traversed in a bidirectional RNN so as to capture dynamic changes of facial textures. To attain more accurate facial actions, a facial landmark trajectory model is proposed to explicitly learn emotion variations of facial components. Further, audio signals are also modeled in a CNN framework by extracting low-level energy features from segmented audio clips and then stacking them as an image-like map. Finally, we fuse the results generated from three clues to boost the performance of emotion recognition. Our proposed MCEF achieves an overall accuracy of 56.66% with a large improvement of 16.19% with respect to the baseline.",

      "abstract": "Many speech emotion recognition approaches have been presented in recent years, and most of them assume that emotional speech utterances in training and testing corpora are collected under the same conditions. However, in many real applications, this assumption does not hold as the training data and testing data are often obtained from different scenarios, e.g., ages, noises, languages. To address this problem, in this paper, a novel transfer learning approach, called transfer semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis (TSDA), is presented for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition. On one hand, the distribution similarity between source and target databases is considered. On the other hand, the semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis (SDA) algorithm is adopted for feature dimension reduction. Finally, the transfer SDA method, which jointly optimizes the SDA and distribution similarity measurement together, is proposed. Experiments are carried out on public emotional datasets, and results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

In this method, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features corresponding to a set of landmark points are first extracted from each facial image. Then, a feature matrix consisting of the extracted SIFT feature vectors is used as input data and sent to a well-designed DNN model for learning optimal discriminative features for expression classification. The proposed DNN model employs several layers to characterize the corresponding relationship between the SIFT feature vectors and their corresponding high-level semantic information. By training the DNN model, we are able to learn a set of optimal features that are well suitable for classifying the facial expressions across different facial views. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two nonfrontal facial expression databases, namely BU-3DFE and Multi-PIE, are respectively used to testify our method and the experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "To address the sequential changes of images including poses, in this paper we propose a recurrent regression neural network(RRNN) framework to unify two classic tasks of cross-pose face recognition on still images and video-based face recognition. To imitate the changes of images, we explicitly construct the potential dependencies of sequential images so as to regularize the final learning model. By performing progressive transforms for sequentially adjacent images, RRNN can adaptively memorize and forget the information that benefits for the final classification. For face recognition of still images, given any one image with any one pose, we recurrently predict the images with its sequential poses to expect to capture some useful information of others poses. For video-based face recognition, the recurrent regression takes one entire sequence rather than one image as its input. We verify RRNN in static face dataset MultiPIE and face video dataset YouTube Celebrities(YTC). The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RRNN method.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel group sparse canonical correlation analysis (GSCCA) method is proposed for simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) channel selection and emotion recognition. GSCCA is a group sparse extension of the conventional CCA method to model the linear correlationship between emotional EEG class label vectors and the corresponding EEG feature vectors. In contrast to conventional CCA method or previous GSCCA methods, a major advantage of our GSCCA method is the ability of handling the group feature selection problem from raw EEG features, which makes it very suitable for simultaneously coping with both EEG emotion recognition and automatic channel selection issues where each EEG channel is associated with a group of raw EEG features. To deal with EEG emotion recognition problem, we adopt the popularly used frequency feature to describe the EEG signal by dividing the full EEG frequency band into five parts, i.e., δ, θ, α, β, and γ frequency bands, and then extract the frequency band features from each band for GSCCA model learning and emotion recognition. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on EEG-based emotion recognition based on the SJTU emotion EEG dataset and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GSCCA method would outperform the state-of-the-art EEG-based emotion recognition approaches.",

Extensive experiments on eNTERFACE and AFEW emotion databases to evaluate the method are conducted.

      "abstract": "Facial expression recognition across domains, e.g., training and testing facial images come from different facial poses, is very challenging due to the different marginal distributions between training and testing facial feature vectors. To deal with such challenging cross-domain facial expression recognition problem, a novel transductive transfer subspace learning method is proposed in this paper. In this method, a labelled facial image set from source domain is combined with an unlabelled auxiliary facial image set from target domain to jointly learn a discriminative subspace and make the class labels prediction of the unlabelled facial images, where a transductive transfer regularized least-squares regression (TTRLSR) model is proposed to this end. Then, based on the auxiliary facial image set, we train a SVM classifier for classifying the expressions of other facial images in the target domain. Moreover, we also investigate the use of color facial features to evaluate the recognition performance of the proposed facial expression recognition method, where color scale invariant feature transform (CSIFT) features associated with 49 landmark facial points are extracted to describe each color facial image. Finally, extensive experiments on BU-3DFE and Multi-PIE multiview color facial expression databases are conducted to evaluate the cross-database & cross-view facial expression recognition performance of the proposed method. Comparisons with state-of-the-art domain adaption methods are also included in the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better recognition performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "A novel bimodal emotion recognition approach from facial expression and speech based on the sparse kernel reduced-rank regression (SKRRR) fusion method is proposed in this paper. In this method, we use the openSMILE feature extractor and the scale invariant feature transform feature descriptor to respectively extract effective features from speech modality and facial expression modality, and then propose the SKRRR fusion approach to fuse the emotion features of two modalities. The proposed SKRRR method is a nonlinear extension of the traditional reduced-rank regression (RRR), where both predictor and response feature vectors in RRR are kernelized by being mapped onto two high-dimensional feature space via two nonlinear mappings, respectively. To solve the SKRRR problem, we propose a sparse representation (SR)-based approach to find the optimal solution of the coefficient matrices of SKRRR, where the introduction of the SR technique aims to fully consider the different contributions of training data samples to the derivation of optimal solution of SKRRR. Finally, we utilize the eNTERFACE '05 and AFEW 4.0 bimodal emotion database to conduct the experiments of monomodal emotion recognition and bimodal emotion recognition, and the results indicate that our presented approach acquires the highest or comparable bimodal emotion recognition rate among some state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, a novel cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) method using domain-adaptive least-squares regression (DaLSR) model is proposed. In this method, an additional unlabeled data set from target speech corpus is used to serve as an auxiliary data set and combined with the labeled training data set from source speech corpus for jointly training the DaLSR model. In contrast to the traditional least-squares regression (LSR) method, the major novelty of DaLSR is that it is able to handle the mismatch problem between source and target speech corpora. Hence, the proposed DaLSR method is very suitable for coping with cross-corpus SER problem. For evaluating the performance of the proposed method in dealing with the cross-corpus SER problem, we conduct extensive experiments on three emotional speech corpora and compare the results with several state-of-the-art transfer learning methods that are widely used for cross-corpus SER problem. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recognition accuracies than the state-of-the-art methods.",

To address this issue, in this paper, a novel transfer non-negative matrix factorization (TNMF) method is presented for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition. First, the NMF algorithm is adopted to learn a latent common feature space for the source and target datasets. Then, the discrepancies between the feature distributions of different corpora are considered, and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) algorithm is used for the similarity measurement. Finally, the TNMF approach, which integrates the NMF and MMD algorithms, is proposed. Experiments are carried out on two popular datasets, and the results verify that the TNMF method can significantly outperform the automatic and competitive methods for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition.",

To this end, we first perform a multi-scale facial region division for each facial image and then extract a set of local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) features corresponding to divided facial regions of the micro-expression videos. Furthermore, we use GSLSR model to build the linear regression relationship between the LBP-TOP facial feature vectors and the micro expressions label vectors. Finally, the learned GSLSR model is applied to the prediction of the micro-expression categories for each test micro-expression video. Experiments are conducted on both CASME II and SMIC micro-expression databases to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than the baseline micro-expression recognition method.",

      "abstract": "In practice, emotional speech utterances are often collected from different devices or conditions, which will lead to discrepancy between the training and testing data, resulting in sharp decrease of recognition rates. To solve this problem, in this letter, a novel transfer semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorization (TSNMF) method is presented. A semi-supervised negative matrix factorization algorithm, utilizing both labeled source and unlabeled target data, is adopted to learn common feature representations. Meanwhile, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a similarity measurement is employed to reduce the distance between the feature distributions of two databases. Finally, the TSNMF algorithm, which optimizes the SNMF and MMD functions together, is proposed to obtain robust feature representations across databases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed method can significantly improve the cross-corpus recognition rates.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the method using Transductive Transfer Linear Discriminant Analysis (TTLDA) and Riesz-based Volume Local Binary Patterns (RVLBP) for image based static facial expression recognition challenge of the Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge (EmotiW 2015). The task of this challenge is to assign facial expression labels to frames of some movies containing a face under the real word environment. In our method, we firstly employ a multi-scale image partition scheme to divide each face image into some image blocks and use RVLBP features extracted from each block to describe each facial image. Then, we adopt the TTLDA approach based on RVLBP to cope with the expression recognition task. The experiments on the testing data of SFEW 2.0 database, which is used for image based static facial expression challenge, demonstrate that our method achieves the accuracy of 50%. This result has a 10.87% improvement over the baseline provided by this challenge organizer.",

      "abstract": "A KY converter has the characteristics of non‐pulsating output current, low‐output voltage ripple and no right‐half plane zero in continuous conduction mode which can overcome the drawbacks of the conventional boost and buck–boost converters. However, when the KY converter is implemented into an integrated circuit, its discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation cannot be avoided due to a small‐inductor value. The boundary for the DCM operation region, DCM dc voltage and small‐signal transfer functions are proposed, which fill the gap of the DCM operation theory for the KY converter. Simulation results, using MATLAB and Cadence, are provided to verify the deduced DCM operation theory of the KY converter. The DCM closed‐loop controller design can be achievable in future.",

Based on the model, the mathematical equations for analyzing the level shifter's characteristics and its respective performances are also derived. Design criteria for the capacitive floating level shifter are proposed derived from the model and corresponding MATLAB simulation results. Furthermore, transistor-level simulations using 65-nm CMOS technology verify the deduced simplified circuit model and the proposed design criteria, following which, overdesign can be avoided to guarantee the proper operation of the floating capacitive level shifter, thus saving chip area and reducing cost.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a generalized Type III controller design interface for DC-DC converters is built and presented in order to calculate the compensator parameter values in a more convenient and fast way. When the specifications of the DC-DC converter (buck, boost, buck-boost, etc.) are input to the MATLAB design interface, the corresponding parameters values (resistors and capacitors) of the Type III compensator and the bode plot of the DC-DC converter open loop gain can be obtained. By designing the Type III controller though this interface, the DC-DC converter can obtain stable and fast transient response performances with small steady state error. Finally, simulation results using 65-nm CMOS technology are presented to verify the developed generalized Type III controller design interface for different DC-DC converters.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel transductive transfer linear discriminant analysis (TTLDA) approach for cross-pose facial expression recognition (FER), in which training and testing facial images are taken under the two different facial views. The basic idea of the proposed expression recognition method is to choose a set of auxiliary unlabelled facial images from target facial pose and leverage it into the labelled training image set of source facial pose for discriminant analysis, where the labels of the auxiliary images are parameters of TTLDA to be optimized. After learning the class labels of the auxiliary image set, we train a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying the testing facial images based on them. On the other hand, to make full utilize the facial appearance information of color images for improving expression recognition accuracy, we adopt color scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to describe facial image feature. Finally, we conduct experiments on BU-3DFE and Multi-PIE multiview color facial expression databases to evaluate the proposed cross-pose FER method and compare the results with other methods.",

For each color component image, we extract a set of color local features to represent the color component image, where color local features could be either color local binary patterns (LBP) or color scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). To cope with the facial expression recognition problem, we use a group sparse least square regression (GSLSR) model to describe the relationship between the color local feature vectors and the associated emotion label vectors and then perform expression recognition based on it. Finally, experiments on the Multi-PIE color facial expression database are conducted to testify the proposed method and compare the results with state-of-the-art methods.",

It first gives a brief introduction of the facial emotion recognition methods. The chapter then briefly reviews the facial expression databases that are commonly used for the non-frontal facial emotion recognition researches. The method of using of 3D face model for face recognition has been proven to achieve better recognition results than 2D facial images due to its robustness to the poses, scales, and lighting variations. To perform the emotion classification, one may choose a classifier, for example, the support vector machine or Adaboost, and then classify each 3D face model into one of the basic emotion categories based on the geometric features.",

To tackle this problem, in this letter, inspired from the recent developments of sparse coding and transfer learning, a novel sparse transfer learning method is presented for speech emotion recognition. Firstly, a sparse coding algorithm is employed to learn a robust sparse representation of emotional features. Then, a novel sparse transfer learning approach is presented, where the distance between the feature distributions of source and target datasets is considered and used to regularize the objective function of sparse coding. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the automatic recognition approach, the proposed method achieves promising improvements on recognition rates and significantly outperforms the classic dimension reduction based transfer learning approach.",

First, the source and target speaker models are each trained from the background model by adopting maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. Then, a novel ISMA method is presented for alignment and transformation of spectral features. Finally, the proposed ISMA approach is further combined with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to improve the conversion performance. A series of objective and subjective experiments are carried out on CMU ARCTIC dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.",

      "abstract": "The poor alignment and large variations in the temporal sale of facial expressions are two crucial problems for facial expression recognition (FER). Canonical correlation (CC) has recently received increasing attention in surveillance face recognition because of its robustness to variations of alignment. But it could not suit well to FER, because the facial expression variations and temporal information are ignored for canonical subspace. This paper proposes the revised canonical correlation method to address the two above described issues for making FER be robust to false detection or mis-alignment. Firstly, this paper presents the local binary pattern to describe the appearance features for enhancing the spatial variations of facial expression. Secondly, this paper proposes the temporal orthogonal locality preserved projection for building a canonical subspace of a video clip, where it mostly captures the motion changes of facial expressions. Then this paper presents the discriminative CC to model the low-dimensional feature space, which increases robustness to imprecise alignment and strengthens discrimination for facial expressions. Extensive experimental results on Extended Cohn-Kanade and MAHNOB-HCI databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best results in recognizing facial expressions and performs robustly with ordinary on general face detection and eye detection.",

      "abstract": "To enhance the recognition rate of speaker independent speech emotion recognition, a feature selection and feature fusion combination method based on multiple kernel learning is presented. Firstly, multiple kernel learning is used to obtain sparse feature subsets. The features selected at least n times are recombined into another subset named n-subset. The optimal n is determined by 10 cross-validation experiments. Secondly, feature fusion is made at the kernel level. Not only each kind of feature is associated with a kernel, but also the full feature set is associated with a kernel which is not considered in the previous studies. All of the kernels are added together to obtain a combination kernel. The final recognition rate for 7 kinds of emotions on Berlin Database is 83.10%, which outperforms state-of-the-art results and shows the effectiveness of our method. It is also proved that MFCCs play a crucial role in speech emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, we propose a novel speech emotion recognition method based on least square regression (LSR) model, in which a novel incomplete sparse LSR (ISLSR) model is proposed and utilized to characterize the linear relationship between speech features and the corresponding emotion labels. In training the ISLSR model, both labeled and unlabeled speech data sets are utilized, where the use of unlabeled data set aims to enhance the compatibility of the model such that it is well suitable for the out-of-sample speech data. Another novelty of ISLSR lies in the capability of dealing with feature selection. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two emotional speech databases. The experimental results on both databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better recognition performance in compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel multi-view facial expression recognition method is presented. Different from most of the facial expression methods that use one view of facial feature vectors in the expression recognition, we synthesize multi-view facial feature vectors and combine them to this goal. In the facial feature extraction, we use the grids with multi-scale sizes to partition each facial image into a set of sub regions and carry out the feature extraction in each sub region. To deal with the prediction of expressions, we propose a novel group sparse reduced-rank regression (GSRRR) model to describe the relationship between the multi-view facial feature vectors and the corresponding expression class label vectors. The group sparsity of GSRRR enables us to automatically select the optimal sub regions of a face that contribute most to the expression recognition. To solve the optimization problem of GSRRR, we propose an efficient algorithm using inexact augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) approach. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both BU-3DFE and Multi-PIE facial expression databases to evaluate the recognition performance of the proposed method. The experimental results confirm better recognition performance of the proposed method compared with the state of the art methods.",

To efficaciously pick up the spatio-temporal features, we adopt the Harris 3D feature detector proposed by Laptev and Lindeberg to find the points from both face and gesture videos, and then apply the cuboids feature descriptor to extract the facial expression and gesture emotion features [1],[2]. To further extract the common emotion features from both facial expression feature set and gesture feature set, the SCCA method is applied and the extracted emotion features are used for the biomodal emotion classification, where the K-nearest neighbor classifier and the SVM classifier are respectively used for this purpose. We test this method on the biomodal face and body gesture (FABO) database and the experimental results demonstrate the better recognition accuracy compared with other methods.",

In comparison with the original locality preserving projection (LPP) algorithm, the presented SLPP algorithm is able to simultaneously find the intrinsic manifold of facial feature vectors and deal with facial feature selection. This is realized by the use of l1-norm regularization in the LPP objective function, which is directly formulated as a least squares regression pattern. We use two real facial expression databases (JAFFE and Ekman's POFA) to testify the proposed SLPP method and certain experiments show that the proposed SLPP approach respectively gains 77.60% and 82.29% on JAFFE and POFA database.",

      "abstract": "A novel discriminant analysis criterion is derived in this paper under the theoretical framework of Bayes optimality. In contrast to the conventional Fisher's discriminant criterion, the major novelty of the proposed one is the use of L1 norm rather than L2 norm, which makes it less sensitive to the outliers. With the L1-norm discriminant criterion, we propose a new linear discriminant analysis (L1-LDA) method for linear feature extraction problem. To solve the L1-LDA optimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, in which a novel surrogate convex function is introduced such that the optimization problem in each iteration is to simply solve a convex programming problem and a close-form solution is guaranteed to this problem. Moreover, we also generalize the L1-LDA method to deal with the nonlinear robust feature extraction problems via the use of kernel trick, and hereafter proposed the L1-norm kernel discriminant analysis (L1-KDA) method. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data sets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical subspace learning technique of extracting discriminative features for pattern recognition problems. The formulation of the Fisher criterion is based on the L2-norm, which makes LDA prone to being affected by the presence of outliers. In this paper, we propose a new method, termed LDA-L1, by maximizing the ratio of the between-class dispersion to the within-class dispersion using the L1-norm rather than the L2-norm. LDA-L1 is robust to outliers, and is solved by an iterative algorithm proposed. The algorithm is easy to be implemented and is theoretically shown to arrive at a locally maximal point. LDA-L1 does not suffer from the problems of small sample size and rank limit as existed in the conventional LDA. Experiment results of image recognition confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

First, the speaker models are adapted from the background model using maximum a posteriori (MAP) technique. Then, by utilizing the parameters of adapted speaker models, the Gaussian normalization and mean transformation methods are proposed for VC, respectively. In addition, to improve the conversion performance of the proposed methods, a combination approach is further presented. Finally, objective and subjective experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the results demonstrate that our scheme can obtain comparable performance with the traditional GMM method based on parallel corpus.",

In the first layer, MKL is used for feature selection. The training samples are separated into n groups according to some rules. All groups are used for feature selection to obtain n sparse feature subsets. The intersection and the union of all feature subsets are the result of our feature selection methods. In the second layer, MKL is used again for speech emotion classification with the selected features. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed two-layer MKL scheme, we compare it with state-of-the-art results. It is shown that our scheme results in large gain in performance. Furthermore, another experiment is carried out to compare our feature selection method with other popular ones. And the result proves the effectiveness of our feature selection method.",

      "abstract": "A novel speech emotion recognition method based on the generalized maximum margin discriminant analysis (GMMDA) method is proposed in this paper. GMMDA is a multi-class extension of our proposed two-class dimensionality reduction method based on maximum margin discriminant analysis (MMDA), which utilizes the normal direction of optimal hyperplane of linear support vector machine (SVM) as the projection vector for feature extraction. To generate an optimal set of projection vectors from MMDA-based dimensionality reduction method, we impose orthogonal restrictions on the projection vectors and then recursively solve the problem. Moreover, to deal with the multi-class speech emotion recognition problem, we present two recognition schemes based on our proposed dimensionality reduction approach. One is using one-versus-one strategy for multi-class classifica- tion, and the other one is to compose the projection vectors of each pair of classes to obtain a transformation matrix for the multi-class dimensionality reduction.

In this paper, we investigate the use of kernel reduced-rank regression (KRRR) model to address the emotion recognition problem from speech. KRRR is a nonlinear extension of the linear reduced-rank regression (RRR) model via the kernel trick, in which a kernel mapping is used for the multivariable of RRR. To find the optimal kernel for KRRR, a kernel optimization algorithm is also proposed in the paper. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Berlin emotional database. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm for facial expression recognition. In contrast to the traditional CCA algorithm, the proposed method is capable of selecting the optimal spectral components of the training data matrix in modelling the linear correlation between the facial feature vectors and the corresponding expression class membership vectors. We formulate this spectral selection problem as a sparse optimization problem, where the ℓ <inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf> -norm penalty is adopted to this goal. To recognize the emotion category of each facial image, we present a linear regression formula to predict the emotion class membership for each facial image. The experiments on the JAFFE facial expression database confirm the better recognition performance of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Feature representation is an important research topic in facial expression recognition from video sequences. In this letter, we propose to use spatiotemporal monogenic binary patterns to describe both appearance and motion information of the dynamic sequences. Firstly, we use monogenic signals analysis to extract the magnitude, the real picture and the imaginary picture of the orientation of each frame, since the magnitude can provide much appearance information and the orientation can provide complementary information. Secondly, the phase-quadrant encoding method and the local bit exclusive operator are utilized to encode the real and imaginary pictures from orientation in three orthogonal planes, and the local binary pattern operator is used to capture the texture and motion information from the magnitude through three orthogonal planes. Finally, both concatenation method and multiple kernel learning method are respectively exploited to handle the feature fusion. The experimental results on the Extended Cohn-Kanade and Oulu-CASIA facial expression databases demonstrate that the proposed methods perform better than the state-of-the-art methods, and are robust to illumination variations.",

      "abstract": "Although 2-D canonical correlation analysis (2DCCA) has been proposed to reduce the computational complexity while reserving local data structure of image, the learned canonical variables of 2DCCA are the linear combination of all the original variables, which makes it hard to interpret the solutions and might have less generality. In this paper, we propose a sparse 2-D canonical correlation analysis (S2DCCA) to solve the drawbacks of the 2DCCA method and apply it to image feature extraction. The basic idea of S2DCCA is to impose two lasso penalties on the objective function of 2DCCA to obtain two sets of sparse projection directions via low rank matrix approximation. We conduct extensive experiments on both FERET and AR databases to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Discriminant analysis plays an important role in statistical pattern recognition. A popular method is the Foley-Sammon optimal discriminant vectors (FSODVs) method, which aims to find an optimal set of discriminant vectors that maximize the Fisher discriminant criterion under the orthogonal constraint. The FSODVs method outperforms the classic Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) method in the sense that it can solve more discriminant vectors for recognition. Kernel Foley-Sammon optimal discriminant vectors (KFSODVs) is a nonlinear extension of FSODVs via the kernel trick. However, the current KFSODVs algorithm may suffer from the heavy computation problem since it involves computing the inverse of matrices when solving each discriminant vector, resulting in a cubic complexity for each discriminant vector. This is costly when the number of discriminant vectors to be computed is large. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for solving the KFSODVs, which is based on rank-one update (ROU) of the eigensytems. It only requires a square complexity for each discriminant vector. Moreover, we also generalize our method to efficiently solve a family of optimally constrained generalized Rayleigh quotient (OCGRQ) problems which include many existing dimensionality reduction techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on several real data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The method of common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSPs) is an extension of common spatial patterns (CSPs) by utilizing the technique of delay embedding to alleviate the adverse effects of noises and artifacts on the electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. Although the CSSPs method has shown to be more powerful than the CSPs method in the EEG classification, this method is only suitable for two-class EEG classification problems. In this paper, we generalize the two-class CSSPs method to multi-class cases. To this end, we first develop a novel theory of multi-class Bayes error estimation and then present the multi-class CSSPs (MC-SSPs) method based on this Bayes error theoretical framework. By minimizing the estimated closed-form Bayes error, we obtain the optimal spatio-spectral filters of MCSSPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the BCI competition 2005 data set. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the previous multi-class CSPs (MCSPs) methods in the EEG classification. 1",

Label information in each update is helpful to update discriminative model in incremental learning. However, the procedure of labeling samples is always a time-consuming and tedious task. In this paper, we propose two labeling algorithms for unknown samples, one is discriminative Transductive Confidence Machine for K-Nearest Neighbor (TCM-KNN), the other is its improved algorithm for choosing good quality discriminative samples and enhancing the performance of the procedure of labeling samples; and then these methods is applied in the incremental learning[2] before updating model. Experiment on PIE database has been carried out for comparing their recognition rate and complexity. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method for incremental learning is more robust and effective than batch learning.",

      "abstract": "Non-frontal view facial expression recognition is important in many scenarios where the frontal view face images may not be available. However, few work on this issue has been done in the past several years because of its technical challenges and the lack of appropriate databases. Recently, a 3D facial expression database (BU-3DFE database) is collected by Yin et al. [10] and has attracted some researchers to study this issue. Based on the BU-3DFE database, in this paper we propose a novel approach to expression recognition from non-frontal view facial images. The novelty of the proposed method lies in recognizing the multi-view expressions under the unified Bayes theoretical framework, where the recognition problem can be formulated as an optimization problem of minimizing an upper bound of Bayes error. We also propose a close-form solution method based on the power iteration approach and rank-one update (ROU) technique to find the optimal solutions of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on BU-3DFE database with 100 subjects and 5 yaw rotation view angles demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Dual-space linear discriminant analysis (DSLDA) is a popular method for discriminant analysis. The basic idea of the DSLDA method is to divide the whole data space into two complementary subspaces, i.e., the range space of the within-class scatter matrix and its complementary space, and then solve the discriminant vectors in each subspace. Hence, the DSLDA method can take full advantage of the discriminant information of the training samples. However, from the computational point of view, the original DSLDA method may not be suitable for online training problems because of its heavy computational cost. To this end, we modify the original DSLDA method and then propose a data order independent incremental algorithm to accurately update the discriminant vectors of the DSLDA method when new samples are inserted into the training data set. We conduct experiments on the AR face database to confirm the better performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of the recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known feature extraction method in statistical pattern recognition community. The basic idea of LDA is to find a set of optimal discriminant vectors that maximize the Fisher's discriminant criterion. One major problem of the Fisher's criterion is that its discriminant performance largely depends on the class mean differences. Hence, the LDA method may not work well as for the case of the heteroscedastic problem since it can not make use of the discriminant information from the class covariance differences. To this end, in this paper we propose a new discriminant criterion consisting of both class mean and covariance differences to replace the Fisher's criterion. Based on the new discriminant criterion, we propose a heteroscedastic extension method of linear discriminant analysis (namely the HELDA method). We also propose an approximate solution method for HELDA (AHELDA) via matrices joint diagonalization (JD) to reduce the computational complexity. The extensive experiments on texture classification confirm the better classification performance of our method.",

Fuzzy fisherface (F-fisherface) method is an extension of the fisherface method by incorporating the class membership to each training sample in calculating the scatter matrices. In this paper, we reformulate the fuzzy between-class scatter matrix in a pairwise form and then impose a weight on each pair of classes, where the weight aims to emphasize the different roles of the individual class pairs in the discrimination. By using the weighted pairwise form of the between-class scatter matrix, we can make use of the advantage of the class membership. On the other hand, since the weight emphasizes the pair of classes that are close together and deemphasizes those that are far away from each other, the proposed method will be more advantageous for the classification task. The experimental results on real face database confirm the better recognition performance of the proposed method.",

Local temporal common spatial patterns (LTCSP) is a technique to capture the local temporal information of EEG signal, and has two free parameters including the number of nearest neighbors and the kernel variance, which have to be specified manually. In this paper we propose a novel method for selecting the optimal parameter for LTCSP automatically. Comparing computational time and classification rate on BCI Competition 2003 data set, it shows that our proposed method is more efficient than CSP and LTCSP.",

Different from classical common spatial patterns (CSP) that uses only global spatial covariances to compute the optimal filter, LTCSP considers temporally local information in the variance modelling. The underlying manifold variances of EEG signals contain more discriminative information. LTCSP is an extension to CSP in the sense that CSP can be derived from LTCSP under a special case. By constructing an adjacency matrix, LTCSP is formulated as an eigenvalue problem. So, LTCSP is computationally as straightforward as CSP. However, LTCSP has better discrimination ability than CSP and is much more robust. Simulated experiment and real EEG classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LTCSP method.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new approach, called local and weighted maximum margin discriminant analysis (LWMMDA), to performing object discrimination. LWMMDA is a subspace learning method that identifies the underlying nonlinear manifold for discrimination. The goal of LWMMDA is to seek a transformation such that data points of different classes are projected as far as possible while points within a same class are as compact as possible. The projections are obtained by maximizing a new discriminant criterion, called local and weighted maximum margin criterion (LWMMC). Different from previous maximum margin criterion (MMC) which seeks only the globally Euclidean structure of data points, LWMMC takes the local property into account, which makes LWMMC more accurate in finding discriminant information. LWMMC has an additional weighted parameter β that further broadens the average margin between different classes. Computationally, LWMMDA completely avoids the singularity problem. Besides, LWMMDA couples the QR-decomposition into its framework, which makes LWMMDA very efficient and stable in implementation. Finally, LWMMDA framework is straightforwardly extended into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a nonlinear function ϕ. Experiments on digit visualization, face recognition, and facial expression recognition are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) is the nonlinear extension of the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) via the kernel trick. Mathematically, GDA aims to solve a generalized eigenequation problem, which is always implemented by the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) in the previously proposed GDA algorithms. A major drawback of SVD, however, is the difficulty of designing an incremental solution for the eigenvalue problem. Moreover, there are still numerical problems of computing the eigenvalue problem of large matrices. In this article, we propose another algorithm for solving GDA as for the case of small sample size problem, which applies QR decomposition rather than SVD. A major contribution of the proposed algorithm is that it can incrementally update the discriminant vectors when new classes are inserted into the training set. The other major contribution of this article is the presentation of the modified kernel Gram-Schmidt (MKGS) orthogonalization algorithm for implementing the QR decomposition in the feature space, which is more numerically stable than the kernel Gram-Schmidt (KGS) algorithm. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real data to demonstrate the better performance of the proposed methods.",

The major advantage of the proposed method is the use of the rank-one update technique, rather than the Lagrange multipliers method, to iteratively derive the formula of computing the discriminant vectors of GODV. By contrast with the previous algorithms of GODV, the proposed algorithm has the computational efficiency and the numerical stability because of the avoidance of solving the inverse computation of matrices. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be easily extended to tackle the nonlinear problem via kernel trick. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on the Yale face database and ORL face database, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, two novel classifiers, based on locally nearest neighborhood rules, called nearest neighbor line (NNL) and nearest neighbor plane (NNP), are presented for face recognition. The underlying idea of both classifiers is the local linear combination technique that has been previously used in locally linear embedding (LLE) for nonlinear dimension reduction. In comparison to other linear combination based classifiers, such as the nearest feature line (NFL) and the nearest feature plane (NFP), the proposed method has a much lower computation cost. Furthermore, the experimental results on the ORL face database have shown that the performance of both proposed methods are competitive to the NFL and NFP in face classification.",

      "abstract": "Generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) is an extension of the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) from linear domain to a nonlinear domain via the kernel trick. However, in the previous algorithm of GDA, the solutions may suffer from the degenerate eigenvalue problem (i.e., several eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue), which makes them not optimal in terms of the discriminant ability. In this letter, we propose a modified algorithm for GDA (MGDA) to solve this problem. The MGDA method aims to remove the degeneracy of GDA and find the optimal discriminant solutions, which maximize the between-class scatter in the subspace spanned by the degenerate eigenvectors of GDA. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on the ORL face database show that the MGDA method achieves better performance than the GDA method.",

      "abstract": "A real-time face recognition method using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for linear discriminant analysis (GSLDA) is presented in this paper. The GSLDA algorithm avoids the large matrices computation such as computing the inverse or diagonalization of matrices, which may be somewhat problematic in terms of computational demands and numerical accuracy. On the other hand, GSLDA also achieves better recognition performance than the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) by overcoming the degenerate eigenvalue problem of LDA. Experimental results on real face databases have confirmed the better performance of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "A perturbation algorithm for the multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) in high dimensional space is presented. In classical MDA method, scatter matrix within-class often may be singular, especially in face recognition. This usually comes from so-called “small sample size” (SSS) problem, i.e., the dimensionality of input space is higher than the number of all samples. Accordingly, a novel algorithm is proposed to tackle this problem. Experiment on ORL face database shows that compared with eigenface and Fisherface method, using the proposed method, the average MDA error rate is only 3.23%, which is 49.9% of the traditional eigenface and 79.4% of the Fisherfaces method.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an extended multiple discriminant analysis (EMDA) method to solve the feature extraction problem in high dimensional pattern space for multiple classes discrimination. The proposed method can be seen as an extension of the traditional multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) method. which requires that the within-class scatter matrix is nonsingular. However, we may face many discriminant problems that do not satisfy this condition, such as the face recognition where the within-class matrix is often singular. To solve this problem, we extend the traditional MDA method and propose the EMDA method. The feature extraction strategy of the EMDA method is to maximize the trace of the between-class scatter matrix while constrains the trace of the within-class scatter matrix to be zero. However, to find the solution of the EMDA turns out to be a difficult task. In this paper, we find a way to overcome this problem. With the ORL face database, experiments show that the EMDA method reaches the lowest average class error rate compared to the eigenface method and the Fisherface method, which is only 49.9% of that the traditional eigenface and 79.4% of that the Fisherface method.",

This method based on Nearest Feature Line (NFL) is essentially an extension of the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method. Moreover, an algorithm is also proposed in this paper to simplify the computation of the NFL and simplify the computation of KNFL accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that better performance in quiet speech identification can be achieved by means of fast KNFL method.",
