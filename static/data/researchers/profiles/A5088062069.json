      "abstract": "Purpose To comprehensively investigate multifactorial influences on postoperative pain in patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), thereby guiding targeted rehabilitation. Patients and methods We reviewed 316 patients (age &amp;gt;40) who underwent PLIF from January 2022 to May 2024. Based on postoperative Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores and pain duration, they were divided into a non-pain group (210 cases) and a pain group (106 cases). We assessed paraspinal muscle indices (PMI, MMI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), postoperative exercise duration, surgical segments, drainage removal time, and mannitol usage. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results No significant differences were found in age, BMI, education, surgical duration, drainage time, disease duration, time to first ambulation, or mannitol usage ( P &amp;gt; 0.05). However, gender, SAS scores, surgical segments, drainage volume at removal, PMI, MMI, average standing time in the first 2 weeks, and duration of straight-leg raise exercises differed significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified surgical segment ( P = 0.008), drainage volume at removal ( P = 0.008), MMI ( P &amp;lt; 0.001), average standing time ( P = 0.010), and straight-leg raise exercise duration ( P = 0.012) as independent risk factors. Conclusion Paraspinal muscle health and early postoperative exercise are crucial factors influencing PLIF-related postoperative pain. Tailored rehabilitation, enhanced muscle function, and optimized early exercise may reduce postoperative pain and improve outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Multi-target tracking (MOT) technology has become a critical component in applications such as intelligent transportation, campus security, and surveillance systems. However, the challenge of achieving high-precision and low-latency target tracking on edge devices with limited computational resources remains a pressing issue. Existing MOT algorithms, while effective in terms of accuracy, often face significant limitations in real-time performance and computational efficiency, especially when deployed on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-target tracking framework that integrates a sparse attention mechanism with a dynamic channel pruning strategy. The proposed approach builds upon the YOLOv5 and DeepSORT structures, incorporating a local sparse attention module to reduce spatial redundancy in the feature extraction process. Additionally, a dynamic channel pruning mechanism is introduced to optimize the allocation of computational resources, adaptively pruning unnecessary channels during inference to reduce model size and computational overhead. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MOT17 dataset and real-world campus surveillance scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method not only maintains competitive tracking accuracy but also significantly improves inference speed and resource utilization. Compared to existing mainstream tracking algorithms, the proposed framework achieves superior performance in terms of both computational efficiency and real-time processing capability, making it highly suitable for deployment on edge devices in dynamic environments. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategies in improving both the accuracy and efficiency of multitarget tracking systems in real-time applications.",

      "abstract": "Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale, longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy, sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles, employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32 extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend effect: +192% valence improvement, p &lt; 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available, enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling, emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.",

      "abstract": "Background Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is characterized by significant bone mass loss due to reduced oestrogen, leading to an increased risk of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). Comprehensive risk prediction models for diagnosing and predicting fracture risk in this population are still lacking. Objective This study aims to identify key risk factors for OVCF in postmenopausal osteoporotic women and develop a machine learning model to predict OVCF risk by integrating clinical, biological, and musculoskeletal data. Methods This retrospective case-control study included 486 postmenopausal women diagnosed with osteoporosis between 2015 and 2018. The patients were divided into a non-fracture group (Group A) and a vertebral fracture group (Group B) based on whether they developed OVCF during the subsequent 5 years of treatment and follow-up. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for OVCF. Furthermore, a comprehensive risk prediction model was constructed using multiple machine learning algorithms. Results Among the 486 postmenopausal women, 269 (55.35%) experienced OVCF. Low bone mineral density (BMD), chronic inflammation, and sarcopenia were identified as independent risk factors, while regular anti-osteoporotic treatment was associated with a reduced fracture incidence. The Balanced Bagging machine learning model demonstrated an accuracy of 98.98%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, a specificity of 100.00%, and the model’s F 1 -score was 0.99. The deployed model outputs calibrated, patient-specific probabilities with case-level explanations and supports dynamic re-scoring as new BMD/CTx/NLR results become available, enabling personalized risk management in routine care. Conclusion The development of OVCF in postmenopausal osteoporotic women is influenced by a combination of bone metabolism, inflammatory processes, and muscle health. The machine learning model developed in this study provides a reliable and accurate tool for personalized OVCF risk prediction, allowing clinicians to optimize prevention and treatment strategies. Future large-scale prospective studies are required to validate these findings and enhance the model’s predictive capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Smoking poses a serious threat to public health worldwide, with significant differences in smoking behavior and quit success rates among different occupational groups. We propose an \"Occupational Clustering - Dynamic Modeling\" framework, which involves finely classifying occupations into seven major categories and analyzing them from both the \"social-psychological\" dimensions to construct a differentiated intervention model. From a methodological standpoint, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction and extract the most informative features. K-Means clustering is employed to reveal latent socio-psychological groupings within each occupational category, thereby enabling a stratified examination of populations. Random Forest classifier is built and assessed across multiple combinations of input variables: the configuration yielding the highest validation performance is chosen, and its feature‐importance metrics pinpoint the principal drivers of quitting success. To rectify the imbalance between cessation outcomes, the Borderline-SMOTE oversampling approach is used, which enhances the model's ability to detect and correctly classify minority‐class instances. We find significant differences in quit success rates and feature influences among different occupational groups, with the group model performing better in specific occupational groups and the Random Forest model accurately identifying key influencing factors. The use of grouping-based smoking cessation prediction models and feature importance analysis helps in formulating precise intervention strategies, improving quit success rates, advancing the field of smoking cessation interventions, and enhancing public health.",

      "abstract": "Study Design. A real-world, multicenter retrospective study. Objective. To identify independent risk factors for cage subsidence after Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) and develop an interpretable machine learning model for risk prediction. Materials and Methods. Patients with degenerative lumbar disease who underwent single-level PLIF (January 2018–October 2023) were retrospectively included. A training set (n=620) came from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, and a validation set (n=100) from the Second Affiliated Hospital. Cage subsidence (≥2 mm intervertebral height loss) was assessed radiographically. Parameters included paraspinal muscle indices [psoas muscle index (PMI), multifidus muscle index (MMI), fat infiltration (FI)], bone density markers [Hounsfield Unit (HU) value, Vertebral Bone Quality (VBQ), Endplate Bone Quality (EBQ)], cage position, and postoperative alignment. Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors; multiple machine learning models were developed and evaluated. A web-based tool was created for clinical deployment. Results. Multivariate analysis identified PMI, FI, HU value, VBQ, cage position, cage height, postoperative Intervertebral Height (IH), corrected IH, and corrected SA as independent risk factors for cage subsidence. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) outperformed other models, achieving the highest AUC (0.9752), accuracy (0.92), and F1-score (0.9216), with the lowest Brier score (0.0660). After excluding indicators related to paravertebral muscle function from the prediction model, the predictive accuracy of the model decreased substantially. (SHapley Additive exPlanations) SHAP analysis confirmed VBQ, FI and PMI as the most influential predictors. The final model was deployed as a web-based tool for real-time clinical risk assessment. Conclusions. Key risk factors for PLIF cage subsidence were identified, and a validated machine learning model was developed. The high-performance LightGBM model, deployed in a user-friendly web application, enables spine surgeons to optimize surgical planning and reduce subsidence risk.",

      "abstract": "The remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technique estimates vital signs, such as heart rate (HR), by analyzing subtle skin color variation in facial videos induced by the pulse. However, it remains a critical challenge to robustly acquire cardiac pulse information in scenarios with head motion (e.g., rotation and swing), as it inevitably introduces interfering noise, such as facial geometric deformation and displacement. Most existing methods primarily focus on how to extract subtle pulse signals while neglecting the detrimental effects of noise, especially out-of-distribution motion patterns. In response to this, we propose a temporal gated face alignment network (TGFAN) to adaptively counteract motion noise in long-term video sequences. Specifically, the bidirectional temporal face alignment (BFA) block first captures interframe motion discrepancies to align the displaced face feature and then extracts motion-robust pulse features. Furthermore, we propose a learnable temporal gating mechanism that disentangles the features and dynamically guides motion-disturbed segments for feature alignment, thereby alleviating local head motion interference. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance on both intradataset and cross-dataset tests.",

      "abstract": "Lip-reading, a crucial technique to recognize human lip movement patterns for semantic output, has gained increasing attention due to its broad applications in public safety, healthcare, the military, and entertainment. Spatiotemporal feature enhancement techniques have played a significant role in advancing lip-reading research in deep learning. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in methods for lip-reading by exploring key properties of diversity enhancement techniques, involving spatial features, spatiotemporal convolution, attention mechanisms, pulse features, audio-visual features, and so on. Furthermore, according to different network structures, the six spatiotemporal feature enhancement method for lip-reading is offered. And each spatiotemporal feature enhancement method was divided into different subclasses based on the differences in the architecture structure, feature attributes, and application types. Ultimately, this is followed by an in-depth discussion of state-of-the-art spatiotemporal feature enhancement methods, accompanied by an analysis of the challenges and limitations faced, and a discussion of future research directions. From different views, this comprehensive review reveals the limitations and intrinsic disparities among these techniques in different categories for scholars to embark on innovative paths in the advancement of lip-reading.",

The results show that extrusion produces a typical basal fiber texture and streamlines of second phases. All samples exhibit the lowest Schmid factor of basal slip (SF b ) and the superior tensile yield strength (TYS) along extrusion direction (ED). The sample with extrusion ratio of 20 exhibits the largest average grain size, but the smallest SF b which compensates for the disadvantage of grain coarsening and maintains the strength. After being peak-aged at 175 °C for 48 h, the sample with the extrusion ratio of 20 shows the optimal TYS along all the directions, compared to the other samples. This hopes to provide useful information for optimizing the deformation parameters of the AZ42 alloys.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Biodegradation is a promising and environmentally friendly strategy for plastic pollution management. Landfills decompose municipal solid waste, including almost 50% of global plastic debris and even some of the oldest synthetic plastics, fostering naturally selected plastic biodegradation. Herein, we present a global collection of plastic biocatalytic enzymes from landfills using metagenomics and machine learning. Metagenomic analysis identified 117 plastic-degrading genes, with 39 incorporated in 22 prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). A machine-learning approach predicted 978,107 candidate plastic-degrading genes, 712 of which were encoded respectively by 150 MAGs. Our results highlight landfills as reservoirs of diverse, naturally selected plastic-degrading microbes and enzymes, serving as references and/or models for biocatalysis engineering and in situ bioremediation of plastic pollution.",

      "abstract": "Empathetic response generation, aiming to understand the user’s situation and feelings and respond empathically, is crucial in building human-like dialogue systems. Traditional approaches typically employ maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective during training, yet fail to align the empathy levels between generated and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation framework using reinforcement learning (EmpRL). The framework develops an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and further fine-tunes it to initialize the policy. To align the empathy levels between generated and target responses within a given context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms—emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration—is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. During reinforcement learning training, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to fine-tune the policy, enabling the generation of empathetic responses. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework significantly improves the quality of generated responses, enhances the similarity in empathy levels between generated and target responses, and produces empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects.",

      "abstract": "The emotional support conversation (ESC) system is tailored to reduce the distress of individuals who are experiencing emotional challenges. To achieve this goal, the system must fully understand the emotional state of the user and employ appropriate strategies to provide effective emotional support. However, most existing methods predominantly focus on the user’s psychological state and the causes of user’s emotional problem, neglecting key cues, e.g., topics of conversation and listener’s psychological state. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the user’s situation and ineffective emotional support. This article presents a novel method that utilizes <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</u>rompt learning with <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</u>ulti<underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</u>erspective <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</u>ues (PMPC) to generate emotional support responses. Specifically, we extract multiperspective cues from the dialogue history and the causes of user’s emotional problem. To fully utilize the different cues within the ESC system, we categorize them into two groups: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">semantic enhancement cues</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">semantic constraint cues</i>. Subsequently, we construct two prompts based on different categories of cues, which are designed to thoroughly understand user’s emotional predicament and generate an engaging support response, respectively. Experimental results on the ESConv dataset demonstrate that our proposed PMPC can surpass other approaches in both automatic and human evaluation metrics, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy and potential impact in real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have explored correlations between behavioral expressions (facial features, body activity intensities) and personality traits or psychological symptoms, yet systematic research remains limited. Addressing this gap is critical, as understanding these relationships could transform mental health assessment by enabling non-invasive, real-time psychological monitoring. We assessed 167 participants using the SCL-90 and BFI-2 scales. Facial features were extracted via OpenFace 2.0, and body activity intensities via YOLOv7-Pose. Correlation analyses revealed significant links between behavioral expressions and psychological characteristics. Machine learning models (MLP, XGB, GRU) were developed using 56 behavioral features, with performance evaluated by f1-score, precision, recall, and AUC. Key findings showed a negative correlation between phobic anxiety and AU07, AU15, and Gaze-angle-x activity (p &lt; 0.01), and a positive correlation between conscientiousness and AU07, Pose-Rz, and neck activity (p &lt; 0.01). The bimodal GRU model, integrating all features, achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.736, precision = 0.714, recall = 0.714, f1-score = 0.71). This study highlights the feasibility of using machine learning to predict personality traits and psychological symptoms from facial and body activity data. The results affirm specific associations between behavioral expressions and psychological traits, providing a foundation for precise, personalized mental health assessment tools. This study introduces a novel integration of facial and body data using machine learning, revealing new behavioral–psychological associations and establishing an innovative framework for automated, personalized mental health assessment.",

      "abstract": "Existing feature selection methods mainly target single-label learning and multi-label learning, and only a few algorithms are optimized for label distribution learning. In label distribution learning, the associated labels of each sample have different levels of importance. Therefore, multi-label feature selection algorithms cannot be directly applied to label distribution learning. Discretizing label distribution data into multi-label data will cause part of the supervision information to be lost. In most practical applications of label distribution learning, the feature space is undefined, and the features are in the form of flow features. To solve this problem, this paper applies fuzzy rough set theory and applies the flow feature framework to propose a dynamic label distribution feature selection algorithm that handles flow features. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective than six state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms on 12 datasets with respect to six representative evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "Vision-based depression estimation is an emerging yet impactful task, whose challenge lies in predicting the severity of depression from facial videos lasting at least several minutes. Existing methods primarily focus on fusing frame-level features to create comprehensive representations. However, they often overlook two crucial aspects: 1) inter- and intra-cue correlations, and 2) variations among samples. Hence, simply characterizing sample embeddings while ignoring to mine the relation among multiple cues leads to limitations. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Cue Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework to mine the relation among multiple cues for discriminative representation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel cross-characteristic attentive interaction module to model the relationship among multiple cues from four facial features (e.g., 3D landmarks, head poses, gazes, FAUs). Then, we propose a temporal segment attentive interaction module to capture the temporal relationships within each facial feature over time intervals. Moreover, we integrate contrastive learning to leverage the variations among samples by regarding the embeddings of inter-cue and intra-cue as positive pairs while considering embeddings from other samples as negative. In this way, the proposed MCCL framework leverages the relationships among the facial features and the variations among samples to enhance the process of multi-cue mining, thereby achieving more accurate facial depression estimation. Extensive experiments on public datasets, DAIC-WOZ, CMDC, and E-DAIC, demonstrate that our model not only outperforms the advanced depression methods but that the discriminative representations of facial behaviors provide potential insights about depression.

To date, this is the largest multilingual MWP dataset available. We utilize this dataset and show the viability of using pre-trained multilingual sequence-sequence language models (prMSLMs) for autoregressive MWP generation in both monolingual and multilingual setups, particularly for low-resource languages. We also integrate a math constraint satisfaction module with autoregressive text generation. Our extensive evaluations identify several factors that affect autoregressive text generation on prMSLMs. These include language representation in the model, model size, existence of similar languages in the model, and language script. Overall, our results reveal that autoregressive MWP generation on top of prMSLMs is very promising, even for low-resource languages.",

Current methods recover the details from low-light images while inevitably amplifying the noise in images, resulting in poor visual quality. In this paper, we firstly introduce DiT into the low-light enhancement task and design a novel Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer based Low-light image enhancement (SDTL) framework. We compress the feature through wavelet transform to improve the inference efficiency of the model and capture the multi-directional frequency band. Then we propose a Structure Enhancement Module (SEM) that uses structural prior to enhance the texture and leverages an adaptive fusion strategy to achieve more accurate enhancement effect. In Addition, we propose a Structure-guided Attention Block (SAB) to pay more attention to texture-riched tokens and avoid interference from noisy areas in noise prediction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on several popular datasets, validating the effectiveness of SDTL in improving image quality and the potential of DiT in low-light enhancement tasks.",

      "abstract": "Visual emotion analysis holds significant research value in both computer vision and psychology. However, existing methods for visual emotion analysis suffer from limited generalizability due to the ambiguity of emotion perception and the diversity of data scenarios. To tackle this issue, we introduce UniEmoX, a cross-modal semantic-guided large-scale pretraining framework. Inspired by psychological research emphasizing the inseparability of the emotional exploration process from the interaction between individuals and their environment, UniEmoX integrates scene-centric and person-centric low-level image spatial structural information, aiming to derive more nuanced and discriminative emotional representations. By exploiting the similarity between paired and unpaired image-text samples, UniEmoX distills rich semantic knowledge from the CLIP model to enhance emotional embedding representations more effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale pretraining framework that integrates psychological theories with contemporary contrastive learning and masked image modeling techniques for emotion analysis across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we develop a visual emotional dataset titled Emo8. Emo8 samples cover a range of domains, including cartoon, natural, realistic, science fiction and advertising cover styles, covering nearly all common emotional scenes. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets across two downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of UniEmoX.

      "abstract": "Driven by the vision of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) toward 6G technology, the WiFi-based respiration sensing approach has emerged as a highly competitive candidate for advanced healthcare services. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate perception of all the moving objects within the sensing area raises challenges for system stability and robustness for real-world deployment, especially for the susceptibility to motion interference from other people. Meanwhile, thanks to the emerging in-area wireless sensing technologies, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$i.e.$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, beamforming, the dynamic environment tolerance of these technologies gives crucial opportunities for target-oriented WiFi-based healthcare services. This article discusses the compelling intersection of in-area WiFi sensing and the future of target-oriented intelligent respiratory healthcare network services. We first present a novel WiFi-based healthcare-assisting framework tailored for inter-user motion interference-tolerable (IMIT) sensing. The detailed components of low-level signal preprocessing, target-direction signal extraction, and healthcare-related services are discussed. By utilizing CSI beamforming technology, which adjusts a directional beam toward the desired direction and adaptively places beam nulls in noisy directions, we can mitigate motion interference and achieve target-oriented healthcare sensing. Finally, we discuss open challenges and potential solutions for target-oriented WiFi healthcare sensing.",

      "abstract": "Facial expressions contain massive affective information. Previous methods have focused on using diverse models based on CNN or Transformer to handle the facial expression recognition(FER) task. However, most of them treat the FER task as a general image classification task and neglect the impact of regions of interest (ROIs) for the performance of FER. To verify the influence of different ROIs, in this paper, we propose a vision Transformer based on <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</b>used <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</b>hifted <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">win</b>dows (FSwin), called FSwin Transformer. The semantic information of the face, obtained by ROIs, guides the FSwin Transformer to focus more on the key regions. The fused shifted windows enable the model to perform global semantic interactions, allowing it to concentrate on key regions without losing the topological structural information of the entire face. Additionally, learnable parameters are introduced to learn the feature weights expressed by each ROI, helping the model dynamically adjust the attention distribution. We have conducted controlled experiments to quantitatively verify the impact of ROIs. And the experimental results show that with the increase of the number of ROIs, the accuracy of FER is significantly improved, demonstrating that the key ROIs play an important role in feature extraction. The results on Jaffe, CK+, FER2013, AffectNet have reached 99.8%, 99.0%, 74.8%, and 68.9%, respectively, which all set new state-of-the-art. Extensive cross-dataset experiments also show that the FSwin Transformer has good generalization ability, proving that our proposed model has a beneficial effect on FER tasks.",

However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this article, we propose a specialized psychological LLM, named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multiturn dialogues, and knowledge-based QA. Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multiturn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared with other LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that significantly impacts individuals' lives and well-being. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective treatment and management of depression. Recently, there are many end-to-end deep learning methods leveraging the facial expression features for automatic depression detection. However, most current methods overlook the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Although very recent 3DCNN methods remedy this gap, they introduce more computational cost due to the selection of CNN-based backbones and redundant facial features. To address the above limitations, by considering the timing correlation of facial expressions, we propose a novel framework called FacialPulse, which recognizes depression with high accuracy and speed. By harnessing the bidirectional nature and proficiently addressing long-term dependencies, the Facial Motion Modeling Module (FMMM) is designed in FacialPulse to fully capture temporal features. Since the proposed FMMM has parallel processing capabilities and has the gate mechanism to mitigate gradient vanishing, this module can also significantly boost the training speed. Besides, to effectively use facial landmarks to replace original images to decrease information redundancy, a Facial Landmark Calibration Module (FLCM) is designed to eliminate facial landmark errors to further improve recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014 dataset and MMDA dataset (a depression dataset) demonstrate the superiority of FacialPulse on recognition accuracy and speed, with the average MAE (Mean Absolute Error) decreased by 21% compared to baselines, and the recognition speed increased by 100% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Codes are released at https://github.com/volatileee/FacialPulse.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Attention-Enhanced Multimodal Temporal Network (AMTN) to address the MuSe 2024 Cross-Cultural Humor Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humor), which highlights the task of humor detection within a cross-cultural context, leveraging multimodal information for its accomplishment. Specifically, we employ the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture the temporal dynamics within individual modalities' features. Following this, we apply attention mechanism to refine the integration of information across different modalities and temporal sequences. The integrated features are then used for humor detection. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of an end-to-end approach for this challenge. Finally, a more robust outcome is achieved by aggregating multiple experimental results, which constitutes our final submission for the challenge. As a result, our solution achieves a remarkable AUC score of 0.8833 on the test dataset, outperforming the baseline by 0.0151 and securing 2nd place in the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary function testing is a crucial examination for respiratory diseases. Current medical spirometers are bulky and inconvenient, while available portable spirometers are extremely expensive and often lack accuracy. Furthermore, both devices require direct contact, inevitably increasing the cross-infection risk. To tackle these challenges, we propose Wi-Pulmo, an end-to-end deep learning-based Wireless System that utilizes WiFi channel state information (CSI) to provide contact-free, convenient, cost-effective, and precise pulmonary function testing outside the clinical setting. Based on the analysis of thoracic and abdominal movement patterns, Wi-Pulmo first validates the feasibility of using WiFi to estimate pulmonary function. Then, Wi-Pulmo designs an efficient fine-grained sensing quality-based algorithm for complete exhalation segmentation. Additionally, a relevant interference-tolerant learning algorithm based on variational inference is proposed to accurately map the CSI of WiFi signals to pulmonary function. Extensive experiments achieved average monitoring error rates of 2.59% for normal subjects in daily scenarios and 5.87% for real patients in tertiary hospitals over a two-month period. These satisfactory results demonstrate the strong effectiveness and robustness of Wi-Pulmo. Furthermore, our findings in clinical reveal a close correlation between chronic diseases and pulmonary function.",

Compared with the traditional pulse width modulation (pulse width modulation, PWM), this scheme does not need a complex controller related parameter setting, and is easy to achieve grid-connected control. Based on the ideal FCS-MPC algorithm, the two-step prediction delay compensation and reference current deviation compensation process are added to improve the accuracy of the system control. Considering the predictive control itself has flexible control objectives of the inverter to optimize the overall performance of the inverter, and the program flow chart is given. The simulation and experimental results show that the improved prediction and control scheme of finite set model is not only feasible and effective, but also has a simple method, small total harmonic distortion rate (total harmonics distortion, THD), but also has the dynamic and static performance and reactive power compensation functions of good traditional prediction and control.",

      "abstract": "The existence of noisy labels is inevitable in real-world large-scale corpora. As deep neural networks are notably vulnerable to overfitting on noisy samples, this highlights the importance of the ability of language models to resist noise for efficient training. However, little attention has been paid to alleviating the influence of label noise in natural language processing. To address this problem, we present CoMix, a robust Noise-against training strategy taking advantage of Co-training that deals with textual annotation errors in text classification tasks. In our proposed framework, the original training set is first split into labeled and unlabeled subsets according to a sample partition criteria and then applies label refurbishment on the unlabeled subsets. We implement textual interpolation in hidden space between samples on the updated subsets. Meanwhile, we employ peer diverged networks simultaneously leveraging co-training strategies to avoid the accumulation of confirm bias. Experimental results on three popular text classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CoMix in bolstering the network’s resistance to label mislabeling under various noise types and ratios, which also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

In the context of emotional support dialogue systems, it is of utmost importance to generate user-relevant and diverse responses. However, previous methods failed to take into account these crucial aspects, resulting in a tendency to produce universal and safe responses (e.g., “I do not know” and “I am sorry to hear that”). To tackle this challenge, a semantic-constrained bidirectional generation (SCBG) framework is utilized for generating more diverse and user-relevant responses. Specifically, we commence by selecting keywords that encapsulate the ongoing dialogue topics based on the context. Subsequently, a bidirectional generator generates responses incorporating these keywords. Two distinct methodologies, namely, statistics-based and prompt-based methods, are employed for keyword extraction. Experimental results on the ESConv dataset demonstrate that the proposed SCBG framework improves response diversity and user relevance while ensuring response quality.",

      "abstract": "Facial expression recognition(FER) is an exceedingly challenging task in the field of computer vision, primarily due to variant head poses, occlusions and illumination conditions. Previous methods focus on extracting more facial features to improve the performance on the FER benchmarks. However, most of them ignore the weights of the key regions. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a vision Transformer with weight reallocation module termed as WR-Former. The weight reallocation module utilizes a hybrid multi-head self-attention and can dynamically iterate during the training process. It guides the model to reallocate tokens based on the importance of different facial regions. Besides, a simple yet effective data augmentation method is proposed to expand training samples and improve the robustness. Experimental results and visualizations demonstrate that our WR-Former outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods and has the ability to better extract the features conveyed by the key facial regions.",

      "abstract": "The standard Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) paradigm employs a viewer-centered methodology, entangling the aspects of illumination and material reflectance into emission solely from 3D points. This simplified rendering approach presents challenges in accurately modeling images captured under adverse lighting conditions, such as low light or over-exposure. Motivated by the ancient Greek emission theory that posits visual perception as a result of rays emanating from the eyes, we slightly refine the conventional NeRF framework to train NeRF under challenging light conditions and generate normal-light condition novel views unsupervisedly. We introduce the concept of a ``Concealing Field,\" which assigns transmittance values to the surrounding air to account for illumination effects. In dark scenarios, we assume that object emissions maintain a standard lighting level but are attenuated as they traverse the air during the rendering process. Concealing Field thus compel NeRF to learn reasonable density and colour estimations for objects even in dimly lit situations. Similarly, the Concealing Field can mitigate over-exposed emissions during rendering stage. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive multi-view dataset captured under challenging illumination conditions for evaluation. Our code and proposed dataset are available at https://github.com/cuiziteng/Aleth-NeRF.",

      "abstract": "With mobile phones becoming increasingly prevalent and embedding high-quality microphones, attackers have the ability to employ these microphones to eavesdrop user’s keyboard input. However, existing work usually assumes that keystroke eavesdropping is performed against known environments and victims, which inevitably makes attack systems lack generalization. To reveal the real threat of the acoustic signal-based attack strategy, this paper proposes a keystroke eavesdropping algorithm called KeystrokeSniffer, which is robust to unknown input environments and unknown victims. In particular, to mimic the real input environment of victims, an environment estimation algorithm is first designed by extracting the timbre-related characteristics to predict the keyboard type and identifying large-size key data from collected unlabeled samples to estimate the 3D microphone coordinates. Then, by imitating unknown environments and victim data, this algorithm achieves effective keystroke eavesdropping with a small training set. By further considering the commonalities of different keystroke habits, a robust feature extraction method that reflects the keystroke location is adopted to reduce the impact of individual input habits. Extensive experimental results using various commodity smartphones indicate that the scheme is capable of predicting keyboard input accurately under different unknown scenarios. Specifically, even when both the victims and keyboards are unknown, KeystrokeSniffer can still achieve high Top-5 accuracy, reaching 79.5% in predicting keystrokes and 96.7% in predicting meaningful words, which demonstrates KeystrokeSniffer has excellent generalization capabilities. By setting different parameter values of various impact factors, e.g., noise and hand length factors, the strong robustness of the system is demonstrated, which proves that KeystrokeSniffer can violate privacy in real situations.",

Traditional deterministic analysis methods are insufficient in capturing the aforementioned characteristics. Therefore, based on fuzzy random theory, this paper establishes a fuzzy random reliability calculation model for the stability of rock masses in hydraulic tunnels. The model constructs a functional relationship that represents the safety margin of the stability, taking into account the fuzziness and randomness of the failure events in hydraulic tunnels. The proposed model is applied to an engineering case study, and the computed results align well with the actual conditions. This model provides a more accurate reflection of the real state of the rock masses in hydraulic tunnels and offers a scientifically rational alternative for calculating the stability of rock masses in hydraulic tunnels.",

      "abstract": "Emotion analysis in conversation has been a popular research topic in the natural language processing field. While much of the existing research has focused on emotion recognition in conversation, the emotion inference task in conversation is more challenging due to its specific prerequisites. In this paper, we propose EmoDamp, a novel model for the conversational emotion inference task. By referring to psychological theories, a bidirectional emotion damping network(BED Net) is designed to model the emotion generation mechanism. Furthermore, external commonsense knowledge is also used to supplement the prediction results to make them more consistent with authentic logic. Finally, a conditional random field (CRF) is used to capture the potential constraints of the emotion transfer process in conversation and simulate emotion contagion. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmoDamp outperforms the baseline model, achieving improved results on each emotion category and showcasing its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Automatic estimation of 3D human pose from monocular RGB images is a challenging and unsolved problem in computer vision. In a supervised manner, approaches heavily rely on laborious annotations and present hampered generalization ability due to the limited diversity of 3D pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that leverages mask as supervision for unsupervised 3D pose estimation. With general unsupervised segmentation algorithms, the proposed model employs skeleton and physique representations that exploit accurate pose information from coarse to fine. Compared with previous unsupervised approaches, we organize the human skeleton in a fully unsupervised way which enables the processing of annotation-free data and provides ready-to-use estimation results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art pose estimation performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. Further experiments on in-the-wild datasets also illustrate the capability to access more data to boost our model. Code will be available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Mask-as-Supervision.",

      "abstract": "Skeleton-based methods have recently achieved good performance in deep learning-based gait emotion recognition (DL-GER). However, the current methods have two drawbacks that limit the ability to learn discriminative emotional features from gait. First, these methods do not exclude the effect of the subject's walking orientation on emotion classification. Second, they do not sufficiently learn the implicit connections between the joints during human walking. In this paper, an augmented spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network (AST-GCN) is introduced to solve these two problems. The interframe shift encoding (ISE) module acquires interframe shifts of joints to make the network sensitive to changes in emotion-related joint movements regardless of the subject's walking orientation. A multichannel implicit connection inference method learns more implicit connection relations related to emotions. Notably, we unify current skeleton-based methods into a common framework that validates the most powerful feature representation capability of our AST-GCN from a theoretical perspective. In addition, we extend the skeleton-based gait dataset using posture estimation software. Experiments demonstrate that our AST-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets on two tasks.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography measurement (also called rPPG prediction) is a vision-based technique that allows for the non-contact monitoring of human physiological activity using facial video. However, precisely detecting subtle color changes on facial skin, especially in less-constrained real-life scenarios, remains a formidable challenge for rPPG prediction. In this work, we address a rPPG-based heart rate estimation task by proposing an end-to-end Channel-wise Interaction Network (CIN-rPPG), in which the core idea contains two specialized units: channel-temporal interactive learning (CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>T</i></sub> ) and channel-spatial interactive learning (CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>S</i></sub> ). The CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>T</i></sub> unit gets the periodicity of the rPPG signal by using temporal-wise shifting and channel-wise scaling to measure the interaction between channels and temporal dimensions. The CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>S</i></sub> unit does both spatial-wise scaling and channel-wise scaling at the same time to perform channel-spatial interaction. This is intended to reveal how rPPG-related visual responses are detected on the human face. We exploit the rPPG recovery through the alternation of CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>T</i></sub> and CI <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>S</i></sub> implementations. The CIN-rPPG is completely conducted by convolutional operations on the sequential 2D feature maps of facial video in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on three heart rate estimation datasets (UBFC-rPPG, PURE, and MMSE-HR) demonstrate that CIN-rPPG achieves state-of-the-art performance on both intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing.",

      "abstract": "Recently, E motion R ecognition in C onversation (ERC) has attracted much attention and has become a hot topic in the field of natural language processing. Conversation is conducted in chronological order; current utterance is more likely influenced by nearby utterances. At the same time, speaker dependency also plays a core role in the conversation dynamic. The combined effect of the sequence-aware information and the speaker-aware information makes the emotion’s dynamic change. However, past works used simple information fusion methods to model the two kinds of information but ignored their interactive influence. Thus, we propose a novel method entitled SIGAT ( S peaker-aware I nteractive G raph A ttention Ne t work) to solve the problem. The core module is a mutual interactive module in which a dual-connection (self-connection and interact-connection) graph attention network is constructed. The advantage of SIGAT is modeling the speaker-aware and sequence-aware information in a unified graph and updating them simultaneously. In this way, we model the interactive influence of them and obtain the final representations, which have richer contextual clues. Experimental results on the four public datasets demonstrate that SIGAT outperforms the state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a model named Joint multimodal feature fusion and Temporal Multi-head Attention (JTMA) to solve the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge 2023. The goal of MuSe-Humor sub-challenge is to predict whether humor occurs in the given dataset that includes data from multiple modalities (e.g., text, audio and video). The cross-cultural testing presents a new challenge that makes it different from the previous years. To solve the above problems, the proposed model JTMA firstly uses a 1-D CNN to aggregate temporal information within the unimodal feature. Then the interactions of inter-modality and intra-modality are performed by the multimodal feature encoder module. Finally, we integrate the high-level representations learned from multiple modalities to accurately predict humor. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated through experimental results obtained on the official test set. Our model achieves an impressive AUC score of 0.8889, surpassing the performance of all other participants in the competition, and securing the Top 1 ranking.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a solution to the MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge in the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge 2023. The task of MuSe-Personalisation aims to predict a time-continuous emotional value (i.e., arousal and valence) by using multimodal data. The MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge faces the individual variations problem, resulting in poor generalization on unknown test sets. To solve the above problem, we first extract several informative visual features, and then propose a framework containing feature selection, feature learning and fusion strategy to discover the best combination of features for sentiment analysis. Finally, our method achieved the Top 1 performance in the MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge, and the result in the combined CCC of physiological arousal and valence was 0.8681, outperforming the baseline system by a large margin (i.e., 10.42%) on the test set.",

      "abstract": "Facial expressions convey a great deal of information during human emotional interaction. However, due to the potential for various types of in-the-wild interferences, such as occlusions and variant head poses, dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) has been a desperately complicated task. Previous methods focus on applying more robust models to extract the spatial-temporal features but ignore the impact of the key features of the regions of interest (ROIs). This inhibits further improvement of recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a 3D vision Transformer with a deformable module termed 3D-DSwin Transformer to guide our model to capture more discriminative features. The deformable module can gradually shift the deformable points to guide our model to pay more attention to the ROIs. A simple yet effective video augmentation method is proposed to expand the number of training samples and avoid overfitting. Visualizations and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed 3D-DSwin Transformer has the ability to obtain the key feature maps, and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on both the FERV39k and DFEW benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Thermal and photothermal catalytic selective oxidation of isobutane to methacrylic acid (MAA) are comparatively studied over a keggin-type Cs2.9Cu0.34V0.49PMo12O40 heteropolyacid acid. An introduction of light was observed to enhance both the i-C4H10 conversion and the MAA selectivity, and consequently the MAA formate rate, particularly at low temperatures. Characterization results show that oxidation of methacrolein (MAL) to MAA is the rate-limiting step while UV light illumination promotes the oxidation of σ-bonded MAL with OH groups to σ-bonded MAA on the catalyst surface. These results demonstrate a synergistic effect of thermal catalysis and photocatalysis in selective oxidation of isobutane to MAA, which suggests photothermal catalysis as a promising strategy to catalyze the selective oxidation of higher hydrocarbons at relative mild reaction conditions.",

To maintain high performance and a low GPU memory consumption, this article proposes a new idea of using multiple hypergraphs to model the conversational context and designs a multi-hypergraph feature aggregation network for ERC. We use context window, speaker information, position information between utterances, and specific step size to construct different hyperedges. Then, various hypergraphs generated by different hyperedges are used to aggregate local and remote context information in turn. Experiments on two dialogue emotion datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of this new model. In addition, our model requires only relatively low GPU memory consumption.",

      "abstract": "Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) has received growing interest in recent years, which aims to extract all emotion clauses and corresponding cause clauses in a document. Previous methods first generate emotion and cause features separately and then generate pair features for pair extraction. These methods either fail to consider the relation between emotion and cause features encoder, or ignore the different importance of different information, resulting in unbalanced information in features, further leading to the wrong prediction. Besides, the original semantic information of clauses is ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-Based Global Interaction Network with Assistant Prediction (GGINAP) to address the problem. Our model can be divided into two stages: independent prediction and interactive prediction. In the first stage, independent pair features are generated from original clause representations for independent pair prediction. In the second stage, we define various types of meta-paths and apply Heterogeneous graph Attention Network (HAN) to model the global interaction between clauses and pairs, capturing contextual information and causal information simultaneously. Then interactive pair features are obtained for interactive pair prediction. To balance the negative effect of interaction, independent and interactive prediction are both considered for the final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods and further analysis prove the effectiveness of our framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/klkkkkk/GGINAP.",

However, existing methods ignore the dynamic characteristics of interaction between speakers, and the problem of long-range context propagation still exists. In this article, we propose a dynamic interaction emotion unit to solve the preceding problems on the transcription of the conversation. First, we propose a main influence interval search algorithm to provide a dynamic interaction interval for each utterance. Then, we utilize the speaker-aware influence module and the two-stream context module to capture the dynamic interaction and the contextual information from this interval. Furthermore, to obtain the speaker state representation rich in emotional information, we propose a novel dynamic routing algorithm to fuse the preceding information. These well-integrated state representations also enable our model to capture contextual information at a longer distance. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Traditional persona-based dialog generation models typically rely on textual descriptions of persona information, but this approach is limited by this and its inability to capture all aspects of a persona's speaking style. To solve this problem, we propose a novel dialog generation model called Speaker-History-Aware Dialogue GEneration (SHADE) through Contrastive and Prompt Learning, which utilizes contrastive learning to model speaking style from historical conversation, resulting in more personalized and distinctive response. Based on the idea of, Prompt learning, on the one hand, we embed small-scale trainable parameters according to Continuous Prompts to stimulate the knowledge of the pre-trained language model, so as to improve the feature extraction ability of the model. On the other hand, we add speaker tag to the decoder input according to Discrete Prompts to improve the consistency of speaking style. We evaluate our model on two popular text-only datasets, DailyDialog and PersonaChat. The results show that SHADE outperforms other multiturn hierarchical dialog generation models in terms of response consistency, logic, and diversity. SHADE is optimal for metrics PPL, NIST, ROUGEL, METEOR, BLUE2, etc. Our proposed SHADE offers a promising direction for persona-based dialog generation, addressing the limitation of existing approaches and paving the way for more personalized and engaging conversational agents in various applications.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive load recognition is of great significance to the study of emotional health, as excessive cognitive load not only impairs work and learning efficiency but also leads to mental pressure and fatigue, affecting overall well-being. Advances in wearable technology and understanding the role of physiological signals in assessing human health have enabled the possibility of cognitive load recognition using these signals. This work proposes a framework that combines multiple physiological signals (ECG, EDA, and PPG) collected through wearable sensors for cognitive load recognition. Heart rate variability (HRV) features are extracted from ECG signals, while statistical characteristics are extracted from EDA and PPG signals. The RFECV feature selection algorithm is utilized in the feature selection module to achieve optimal feature subset selection and redundant feature removal. The classification of cognitive load states is implemented based on the ASAPSO-LightGBM(Adaptive Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization-Light Gradient Boosting Machine) machine learning model. We validated the effectiveness of the framework on two publicly available datasets (MAUS and WESAD). Experimental comparisons of feature combinations and machine learning models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance, with recognition accuracy of 98.52% and 88.38% on the two datasets, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a severe mental illness that affects millions of people's lives Every year, more than 700,000 individuals choose to commit suicide due to depression. Early screening of patients with depression is challenging, making it critical to find methods that can aid doctors in quickly identifying potential patients. Currently, a significant number of depression severity estimation tasks focus on text, speech, and vision, but the exploration of the relationship between eye gaze behavior and depression is incomplete. This paper aims to explore the mapping relationship between eye gaze behavior and depression. We propose an integrated method to estimate depression severity using eye gaze behavior data. We formulate a more reasonable representation of gaze direction by expressing it as the angle of deflection. We employ a deep residual shrinkage network with channel-wise thresholds (DRSN-CW) to process the input gaze sequence and estimate the depression severity score. Moreover, we introduce label distribution learning to represent more fine-grained score information and alleviate the overfitting problem associated with small datasets, enhancing the reliability of depression severity estimation. We train and validate our model on the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.769, and reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) to 3.971 and root mean square error (RMSE) to 5.141. The results demonstrate significant improvement in the depression severity estimation task compared to previous tasks.",

      "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) recently have been widely used in Gait Emotion Recognition (GER). However, the existing GCNs-based GER methods have two drawbacks that limit the ability to learn discriminative feature. In spatial modeling, context-sensitive affective feature of joint is under-extracted due to the neglect of implicit connection. In temporal modeling, multi-scale temporal feature of joint motion is under-extracted or aggregated rigidly. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (STA-GCN) where two main modules are introduced, respectively. Spatial Feature Learning Module (SFLM) infers context-sensitive joint implicit connection and adaptively aggregates spatial feature mined from implicit and explicit connection. Temporal Feature Learning Module (TFLM) extracts and adaptively aggregates multi-scale temporal feature of joint motion. It is worth mentioning that we first pre-train the model using hand-crafted affective feature and counterpart gait. Experimental results demonstrate our STA-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in two tasks.",

      "abstract": "Contrastive learning can reduce the impact of ex-posure bias associated with training using maximum likelihood estimation, which aims to pull together positive samples to increase the likelihood of high-quality summaries and push away irrelevant negative samples to reduce the likelihood of low-quality summaries. In contrastive learning-based text summarization methods, a standard method for selecting positive and negative samples is randomly selected within a batch. This method can lead to sampling bias to the extent that the consistency of the representation space is compromised. Therefore, we propose a new method to penalize false negatives based on ROUGE metric scores as weights to sample from the dynamic output of the model training process. The method calculates ROUGE metric scores for penalizing false negatives in real-time and can distinguish between positive and negative samples to ensure spatial consistency and alleviate exposure bias. Experimental results on XSum, CNN/DM, and Multi-News datasets show that our approach effectively improves the performance of the latest text summarization pre-training models.",

      "abstract": "Word alignment is an important task of detecting translation equivalents between a sentence pair. Although word alignment is no longer necessarily needed for neural machine translation, it’s still useful in a wealth of applications, e.g., bilingual lexicon induction, constraint decoding, and so on. However, the most well-known word aligners are still Giza++ and fastAlign, both of which are implementations of traditional IBM models. To keep pace with the advance in NMT, there has been a surge of interest in replacing the IBM models with neural models. We follow this trend but aim to boost performance of word alignment between Japanese and Chinese, which share a large portion of Chinese characters. Our key idea is to leverage these common Chinese characters in both languages as an indicator for inferring alignment; i.e., the source and target words with the common Chinese characters should be most likely aligned. Following this idea, we propose three methods that leverage common Chinese characters to boost the mBERT-based word alignment, including reward factor, representation alignment, and contrastive training. Furthermore, we annotate and release a golden dataset for Japanese-Chinese word alignment. Experiments on the dataset show that our methods outperform several strong baselines in terms of AER score and verify the effectiveness of exploiting common Chinese characters.",

      "abstract": "Depression has an intense impact on individuals, yet many cases go undiagnosed. Thus, it is imperative to design an effective model for the automated diagnosis of depression. However, existing methods do not adequately capture contextual information in a clinical interview. Inspired by the depression diagnosis process, we propose a new perspective on detecting depression as a dialog information extraction task. Specifically, this article constructs a heterogeneous graph that models the participant’s depression state and uses the graph attention network to aggregate the pieces of depressive clues. In addition, we use the focal loss as a loss function for dealing with class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross-entropy loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model depression state extraction with heterogeneous graph attention neural network (DSE-HGAT) surpasses the baseline models on the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset. Meanwhile, agreement analysis between our proposed model and the gold standard shows that it is moderate ( <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math> </inline-formula> <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$=$</tex-math> </inline-formula> 0.528, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$</tex-math> </inline-formula> 0.05). Overall, our model is very effective in identifying depression in the clinical interview transcript, which has the potential to assist doctors with medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "Emotion is the vital path to achieving strong artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is significant to study the emotional guiding and controlling theory to enhance system intelligence. Conversational datasets in social media contain useful information, including individuals exhibiting continuously changing emotion states in response to external stimuli, and are the foundation for research on artificial emotions. We define dialog-based emotional guidance in reinforcement learning to research the emotional guidance of the discrete emotion model. This article proposes three strategies to obtain the optimal policy: 1) given the current emotional transition matrix, use the emotional Markov decision process (E-MDP) algorithm to calculate the optimal stimulus policy for each target emotion; 2) given the emotional transition sequences, use the emotional Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the optimal stimulus policy; and 3) given the emotional transition sequences, use the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula> -learning algorithm to calculate the optimal stimulus policy. Besides, we improve the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample emotional transition sequences and design a metric to evaluate the effectiveness of policies. Experimental results on three datasets show that these methods can more effectively guide emotion than traditional methods. Particularly, E-MDP achieves the best results while others can be more widely used in real-world scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in multi-party conversations (ERMC) is becoming increasingly popular as an emerging research topic in natural language processing. Recently, many approaches have been devoted to exploiting inter-dependency and self-dependency among participants. However, these approaches remain inadequate in terms of inter-dependency due to the fact that the effects among speakers are not individually captured. In this paper, we design two hypergraphs to deal with inter-dependency and self-dependency, respectively. To this end, we design a multi-hypergraph neural network for ERMC. In particular, we combine average aggregation and attention aggregation to generate hyperedge features, which can allow utterance information to be better utilized. The experimental results show that our method outperforms multiple baselines, indicating that further exploitation of inter-dependency is of great value for ERMC. In addition, we also achieved good results on the emotional shift issue.",

      "abstract": "Emotion analysis on Sina Weibo has a great impetus for government agencies to survey public opinion and enterprises to track market demand. Most of the existing emotion analysis work on Sina Weibo focuses on mining the information contained in a single Weibo, ignoring the problem of inaccurate information extraction caused by the lack of contextual information in Weibo texts. Inspired by humans judging user emotional states from Weibo texts, this article creates a Weibo text five-category emotion classification dataset based on active users and proposes a user-based hierarchical network for Weibo emotion analysis. First, use the multi-head attention mechanism and convolutional neural network set in the information extraction module to analyze a single Weibo text to fully extract the emotional information contained in the text; at the same time, through the moving window set in the relevant information capture module, obtain other Weibo texts posted by the same user within a period, and capture the effective correlation information between Weibo texts; then, the dual text representation obtained above is concatenated, and through the information interaction layer, the relevant information is retrieved again, and the text representation is updated; finally, the classifier output the five-category emotion labels corresponding to each Weibo text. We demonstrate the model’s effectiveness through experiments and analysis in the results.",

      "abstract": "Chinese short text sentiment analysis can help understand society’s views on various hot topics. Many existing sentiment analysis methods are based on sentiment dictionaries. Still, sentiment dictionaries are easily affected by subjective factors. They require a lot of time to build as well as maintenance to prevent obsolescence. For the aim of extracting rich information within texts more effectively, we propose a Channel Attention TextCNN with Feature Word Extraction model (CAT-FWE). The feature word extraction module helps us choose words that affect the sentiment of reviews. Then, these words are integrated with multi-level semantic information to enhance the information of sentences. In addition, the channel attention textCNN module that is a promotion of traditional TextCNN tends to pay more attention to those meaningful features. It eliminates the impacts of features that do not make any sense effectively. We apply our CAT-FWE model to both fine-grained classification and binary classification tasks for Chinese short texts. Experiment results show that it can improve the performance of emotion recognition.",

      "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has the ability to make use of image frame sequences including human faces collected by cameras for measuring heart rate (HR) without any contact. This method generates a time series signal based on the RGB spatial average of the selected region of interest (ROI) to estimate physiological signals such as HR. It is worth to note that the motion artifact produced by the subject’s face shaking is equivalent to adding considerable noise to the signal which will greatly affect the accuracy of the measurement. In this paper, a novel anti-interference multi-ROI analysis (AMA) approach is proposed which effectively utilizes the local information with multiple ROIs, the Euler angle information of the subject’s head, and the interpolation resampling technique of the video for suppressing the influence of face shaking on the accuracy of non-contact heart rate measurement. The proposed method is evaluated on the UBFC-RPPG and PURE datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods are superior to many state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our solutions for the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) 2022, which includes MuSe-Humor, MuSe-Reaction and MuSe-Stress Sub-challenges. The MuSe 2022 focuses on humor detection, emotional reactions and multimodal emotional stress utilising different modalities and data sets. In our work, different kinds of multimodal features are extracted, including acoustic, visual, text and biological features. These features are fused by TEMMA and GRU with self-attention mechanism frameworks. In this paper, 1) several new audio features, facial expression features and paragraph-level text embeddings are extracted for accuracy improvement. 2) we substantially improve the accuracy and reliability for multimodal sentiment prediction by mining and blending the multimodal features. 3) effective data augmentation strategies are applied in model training to alleviate the problem of sample imbalance and prevent the model form learning biased subject characters. For the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge, our model obtains the AUC score of 0.8932. For the MuSe-Reaction sub-challenge, the Pearson's Correlations Coefficient of our approach on the test set is 0.3879, which outperforms all other participants. For the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, our approach outperforms the baseline in both arousal and valence on the test dataset, reaching a final combined result of 0.5151.",

The goal of the MuSe-Humor\\nsub-challenge is to detect humor and calculate AUC from audiovisual recordings\\nof German football Bundesliga press conferences. It is annotated for humor\\ndisplayed by the coaches. For this sub-challenge, we first build a discriminant\\nmodel using the transformer module and BiLSTM module, and then propose a hybrid\\nfusion strategy to use the prediction results of each modality to improve the\\nperformance of the model. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\\nproposed model and hybrid fusion strategy on multimodal fusion, and the AUC of\\nour proposed model on the test set is 0.8972.\\n",

      "abstract": "A high-quality annotated text corpus is vital when training a deep learning model. However, it is insurmountable to acquire absolute abundant label-balanced data because of the huge labor and time costs needed in the labeling stage. To alleviate this situation, a novel active learning (AL) method is proposed in this paper, which is designed to scratch samples to construct multi-class and multi-label Chinese emotional text corpora. This work shrewdly leverages the superiorities, i.e., less learning time and generating parameters randomly possessed by extreme learning machines (ELMs), to initially measure textual emotion features. In addition, we designed a novel combined query strategy called an asymmetric sampler (which simultaneously considers uncertainty and representativeness) to verify and extract ideal samples. Furthermore, this model progressively modulates state-of-the-art prescriptions through cross-entropy, Kullback–Leibler, and Earth Mover’s distance. Finally, through stepwise-assessing the experimental results, the updated corpora present more enriched label distributions and have a higher weight of correlative emotional information. Likewise, in emotion classification experiments by ELM, the precision, recall, and F1 scores obtained 7.17%, 6.31%, and 6.71% improvements, respectively. Extensive emotion classification experiments were conducted by two widely used classifiers—SVM and LR—and their results also prove our method’s effectiveness in scratch emotional texts through comparisons.",

      "abstract": "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis aims to determine the emotional orientation of a particular aspect of an online comment. Considering that syntax and even sentences themselves are a specific graph structure, most researchers' recent work mainly focuses on the dependency tree. They construct sentences into tree structures according to dependency parser. However, because a sentence can contain many aspects, it is difficult to correctly associate each aspect with the corresponding important part of the sentence by directly using the original dependency tree. To strengthen this association, a reconstructed dependency tree with aspect as the root is constructed by fine-tuning the original dependency tree for each aspect. We propose a neural network model named ARWAT, which performs on the reconstructed tree to learn informative contextual words and grammatical information effectively. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model against multiple baselines on five benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Microexpression recognition from short video sequences is a challenging problem in computer vision and multimedia research. This article proposes a dual expression fusion (DEF) microexpression recognition framework, which performs better on more general videos. This microexpression recognition framework uses deep learning models to extract the facial features from a single frame while directly predicting the action units (AUs) states of that frame. Then, a long short-term memory network (LSTM) predicts the microexpression category on the sequence features. To perform better across different datasets, DEF uses a capsule network to learn more subtle structural information from faces. Since the effective facial features are extracted by a deep convolutional network and the capsule network, the framework performs well through feature fusion. It has relatively low requirements for the content of video data. Based on the proposed framework, we won first place among 12 qualified teams in the ICIP2020 microexpression Recognition Challenge with an average F1 score of 0.6297.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple transfer learning baseline for sign language translation. Existing sign language datasets (e.g. PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily) contain only about 10 K-20K pairs of sign videos, gloss annotations and texts, which are an order of magnitude smaller than typical parallel data for training spoken language translation models. Data is thus a bottleneck for training effective sign language translation models. To mitigate this problem, we propose to progressively pretrain the model from general- domain datasets that include a large amount of external supervision to within-domain datasets. Concretely, we pretrain the sign-to-gloss visual network on the general domain of human actions and the within-domain of a sign-to-gloss dataset, and pretrain the gloss-to-text translation network on the general domain of a multilingual corpus and the within-domain of a gloss-to-text corpus. The joint model is fine-tuned with an additional module named the visual-language mapper that connects the two networks. This simple baseline surpasses the previous state-of-the-art results on two sign language translation benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning. With its simplicity and strong performance, this approach can serve as a solid baseline for future research.",

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised action recognition is a challenging but important task due to the high cost of data annotation. A common approach to this problem is to assign unlabeled data with pseudo-labels, which are then used as additional supervision in training. Typically in recent work, the pseudo-labels are obtained by training a model on the labeled data, and then using confident predictions from the model to teach itself. In this work, we propose a more effective pseudo-labeling scheme, called Cross-Model Pseudo-Labeling (CMPL). Concretely, we introduce a lightweight auxiliary network in addition to the primary backbone, and ask them to predict pseudo-labels for each other. We observe that, due to their different structural biases, these two models tend to learn complementary representations from the same video clips. Each model can thus benefit from its counterpart by utilizing cross-model predictions as supervision. Experiments on different data partition protocols demonstrate the significant improvement of our framework over existing alternatives. For example, CMPL achieves 17.6% and 25.1% Top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 and UCF-101 using only the RGB modality and 1% labeled data, outperforming our baseline model, FixMatch [17], by 9.0% and 10.3%, respectively. 11Project page is at https://justimyhxu.github.io/projects/cmpl/.",

      "abstract": "Heart disease has become a global trend illness, with high mortality and death toll. Based on the accumulated case data, data analysis can be used to predict potential heart disease patients more accurately and optimize the treatment. Comparing with other research, this study uses the most basic algorithm in the tree-based methods to predict the data. In the research, some exploratory analysis on the heart disease data set is done firstly. By analyzing the relationship between each variable, the symptom factors related to heart disease are obtained preliminarily. Then this study develops two heart disease prediction models using two kinds of tree methods and compares the error of the two models. It turns out that the random forest model fits better than the decision tree model which can predict the data much more accurate. This can help medical professionals predict heart disease status based on a patient's clinical data and improve patient treatment efficiency. Also, the study gives hints about the causes of the heart diseases, which will be useful in preventing these fatal illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Transformer structure has shown promising results in multiturn dialog generation. The self-attention mechanism can learn global dependencies but ignores local information, limiting the model's ability to model context information. In this article, we propose an information-enhanced hierarchical self-attention network (IEHSA). In the word-level encoder, words in successive windows are automatically encoded as local information, and words with dependent words are automatically encoded as syntactic information, both of which are used to enhance word information and then feed into the self-attention mechanism. In the utterance-level encoder, adjacent utterance representations are automatically encoded as dialog structure information, and the self-attention mechanism is used to update the utterance representations. The context and masked response representation are then updated using the self-attention mechanism in the decoder. Finally, the correlation between context and reply is calculated and used in further decoding. We compared IEHSA with the current popular hierarchical model on several datasets, and the experiments show that the proposed method has substantial improvements in both metric-based and human evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Neural machine translation has achieved remarkable progress over the past several years; however, little attention has been paid to machine translation (MT) between Japanese and Chinese, which share a large proportion of cognate words that can be utilized as additional linguistic knowledge to enhance translation performance. In this article, we seek to strengthen the semantic correlation between Japanese and Chinese by leveraging cognate words that share common Chinese characters. Specifically, we experiment with three strategies: (1) a shared vocabulary with cognate lexicon induction, which models the commonality between source and target cognates; (2) a shared private representation with a dynamic gating mechanism, which models the language-specific features on the source side; and (3) an embedding shortcut, which enables the decoder to access the shared private representation with shortest distance and aids the training process. The experiments and analysis presented in this article demonstrate that our proposed approaches can significantly improve the performance of both Japanese-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-Japanese translations and verify the effectiveness of exploiting Japanese–Chinese cognates for MT.",

      "abstract": "The encoder-decoder model has achieved remarkable results in natural language generation. However, in the dialogue generation work, we often ignore the influence of the dialogue context information and topic information in the generation, resulting in the generated replies not close to the context or lack of topic information leads to general responses. In this work, we study the generation of multi-turn dialogues based on a large corpus and take advantage of the context information and topic information of the conversation in the process of dialogue generation to generate more coherent context-sensitive responses. We improve upon existing models and attention mechanisms and propose a new hierarchical model to better solve the problem of dialogue context (the HAT model). This method enables the model to obtain more contextual information when processing and improves the ability of the model in terms of contextual relevance to produce high-quality responses. In addition, to address the absence of topics in the responses, we pre-train the LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model to extract topic words of the dialogue content and retain as much topic information of dialogue as possible. Our model is extensively tested in several corpora, and the experiments illustrate that our model is superior to most hierarchical and non-hierarchical models with respect to multiple evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "Conversational Question Generation (CQG) is a new concern in Question Generation (QG) study. Recently Seq2Seq neural network model has been widely used in the QG area. CQG model is also based on the Seq2Seq neural network model. We note a problem: the CQG model's input is not a single sentence, but a long text and conversation history. Seq2Seq model can't effectively process long input, the model will generate questions not related to the answer. To solve this problem, we propose an answer-centric local and global information fusion model. We extract the evidence sentence containing the answer in the passage and encode the evidence sentence and the passage information separately. On the one hand, we add answer-centered position tags in the passage to reinforce the attention of information related to the answer. On the other hand, we put the key sentence into the question type prediction model. By combining the answer position embedding to predict the question type, and then put the predicted question types in the key sentence to guide the generation of the question. Finally, we use a gate mechanism to merge key sentence information and passage information. The experimental results show that we have achieved better results.",

      "abstract": "Various deep learning techniques have been proposed to solve the single-view 2D-to-3D pose estimation problem. While the average prediction accuracy has been improved significantly over the years, the performance on hard poses with depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex or rare poses is still far from satisfactory. In this work, we target these hard poses and present a novel skeletal GNN learning solution. To be specific, we propose a hop-aware hierarchical channel-squeezing fusion layer to effectively extract relevant information from neighboring nodes while suppressing undesired noises in GNN learning. In addition, we propose a temporal-aware dynamic graph construction procedure that is robust and effective for 3D pose estimation. Experimental results on the Human3.6M dataset show that our solution achieves 10.3% average prediction accuracy improvement and greatly improves on hard poses over state-of-the-art techniques. We further apply the proposed technique on the skeleton-based action recognition task and also achieve state-of-the-art performance.

      "abstract": "We present Neural Articulated Radiance Field (NARF), a novel deformable 3D representation for articulated objects learned from images. While recent advances in 3D implicit representation have made it possible to learn models of complex objects, learning pose-controllable representations of articulated objects remains a challenge, as current methods require 3D shape supervision and are unable to render appearance. In formulating an implicit representation of 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformation of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3D location. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes without significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover, through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over multiple instances of an object class. Experiments show that the proposed method is efficient and can generalize well to novel poses. We make the code, model and demo available for research purposes at this https URL",

      "abstract": "A common problem in the task of human-object interaction (HOI) detection is\\nthat numerous HOI classes have only a small number of labeled examples,\\nresulting in training sets with a long-tailed distribution. The lack of\\npositive labels can lead to low classification accuracy for these classes.\\nTowards addressing this issue, we observe that there exist natural correlations\\nand anti-correlations among human-object interactions. In this paper, we model\\nthe correlations as action co-occurrence matrices and present techniques to\\nlearn these priors and leverage them for more effective training, especially on\\nrare classes. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated experimentally,\\nwhere the performance of our approach consistently improves over the\\nstate-of-the-art methods on both of the two leading HOI detection benchmark\\ndatasets, HICO-Det and V-COCO.\\n",

      "abstract": "The perception and expression of emotion, as well as the content of a text, are key factors in the success of conversational agents. However, previous models for conversation generation handled single-language pairs during training and testing, neglecting the complementary information from different languages. In this article, we propose a bilingual-aided interactive approach that can simultaneously and interactively generate bilingual emotional replies to monolingual posts. Specifically, the generation of one emotional reply relies on the output of the encoder, the generated tokens, and the interactive information from the other language decoder. The interactive approach includes 1) internal interaction to capture the change in implicit contextual information and 2) external interaction to balance grammaticality and the expression of emotion. Qualitative and quantitative experiments with NLPCC2017 show that our model performs better in terms of the content and emotion of replies than several state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis analyses the fine-grained sentiment polarity of a particular attribute in a sentence. In addition to the fact that most papers have applied attention mechanisms and neural networks to fine-grained sentiment analysis, some studies have reported outstanding performance from graph-structured neural networks in aspect-based sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose the use of a graph attention network (GAT) to embed external knowledge and grammatical relations (KD-GAT). First, we employ a GAT to extract the nodes and edges related to sentences in the knowledge graph. Second, we consider the influence of conjunctions and parts of speech based on the aspect-oriented syntactic dependency tree. Finally, we emphasize the effect of aspect position in the mechanism of multiple attention. Experiments on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets show that our model can improve the ability to analyze sentiment and that the graph structure method can better integrate grammatical relations to understand a sentence.",

      "abstract": "Point cloud provides a compact and flexible representation for 3D shapes and recently attracts more and more attention due to the increasing demands in practical applications. The major challenge of handling such irregular data is how to achieve the permutation invariance of points in the input. Most of existing methods extract local descriptors that encode the geometry of local structure, followed by a symmetric function to form a global representation. The max pooling usually serves as the symmetric function and shows slight superiority compared to the average pooling. We argue that some discrimination information is inevitably missing when applying the max pooling across all local descriptors. In this paper, we propose the BoW pooling, a plug-and-play unit to substitute the max pooling. Our BoW pooling analyzes the set of local descriptors statistically and generates a histogram that reflects how the primitives in the dictionary constitute the overall geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Bow pooling is efficient to improve the performance in point cloud classification, shape retrieval and segmentation tasks and outperforms other existing symmetric functions.",

      "abstract": "A common problem in the task of human-object interaction (HOI) detection is that numerous HOI classes have only a small number of labeled examples, resulting in training sets with a long-tailed distribution. The lack of positive labels can lead to low classification accuracy for these classes. Towards addressing this issue, we observe that there exist natural correlations and anti-correlations among human-object interactions. In this paper, we model the correlations as action co-occurrence matrices and present techniques to learn these priors and leverage them for more effective training, especially on rare classes. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated experimentally, where the performance of our approach consistently improves over the state-of-the-art methods on both of the two leading HOI detection benchmark datasets, HICO-Det and V-COCO.",

We propose a multimodal psychological computational technology in a universal environment. We establish a mental health database following a naturalistic paradigm as well as a long-term ubiquitous interpretable psychological computing model based on prior knowledge and multimodal information fusion. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both basic and complex emotion detection on the proposed mental health database and effectively solves scientific and accuracy-related problems in long-term complex mental health status recognition and prediction. Regarding psychology and the medicine of mental disorders, we identify the continuous emotional symptoms of three kinds of mental disorders, which have not previously been accurately observed based on multimodal big data. They are accurately and quantitatively described by the newly introduced interpretable psychological computing model. At the same time, we establish the relationship between two complex emotions and the basic emotions, breaking through the cognitive limitations of the traditional psychology field.",

      "abstract": "When using neural networks to recognize facial expressions, determining which features help identify different expressions is essential, and there is a massive information transmission loss between layers of network with multiple layers. This paper proposes a robust vectorized convolutional neural network (CNN) model that introduces an attention mechanism for extracting features in the region of interests(ROIs) of the face. The ROIs in the facial image are marked before the image is input into the neural network. In particular, the attention concept is adopted in the first layer of the proposed neural network to perform ROIs-related convolution calculation, and ROIs-related convolution calculation results of the specific fields in the ROIs are increased by extracting more robust features. Next, the idea of features' vectors inspired by CapsNet is used in the following layer of the proposed neural network. Multi-level convolutions are used to extract feature vectors of different ROIs for facial expression, and then the feature vectors are reconstructed by a decoder to reconstruct the image. Comprehensive comparative experiments and cross-database experiments are conducted to verify the validity and robustness of our proposed model. The experimental results also demonstrate that our method is very effective in improving the performance of facial expressions recognition.",

      "abstract": "摘要： 流体运动特性对管道近壁面阻力变化有重要影响。以速度梯度和切应力线性表示壁面摩擦阻力，分析了自激振荡腔室出流管道剪切涡流演变规律及圆截面涡流层次分布状态变化。采用大涡模拟数值方法，计算得到出流管道某轴切面及法向面的瞬时速度和平均速度、不同上下游管径比下出流管道的壁面切应力以及不同长径比下出流管道的法向速度梯度。研究结果表明：自激振荡脉冲射流流动受反向助推涡影响具有强烈三维特性，射流流型呈现“波浪式”运动且发生周向偏转，射流流速及流型均发生周期性波动变化；当自激振荡腔室上下游管径比大于1时，出流管道壁面切应力开始减小，且随腔室上下游管径比增大，切应力缩减率最大达到约30%，壁面摩擦阻力随之减小；自激振荡腔室长径比在0.55时射流最大法向速度梯度波动幅值达到最大，当长径比继续增大时，出流管道内射流法向速度梯度逐渐减小，摩擦阻力亦随之减小。研究结果可为自激振荡脉冲增输装备设计及优化提供理论基础与科学依据。",

      "abstract": "Dynamic emotion is typically used to facilitate human–machine interactions. Conversational data from social media contain a considerable amount of useful information, and such data are the foundation for researching dynamic and artificial emotion. At present, most human–machine interaction systems focus on the complexity and accuracy of the dialog but neglect the emotional characteristics of the speaker. When generating a dialog considering the emotional personality of the interlocutor, controlling, and guiding the dialog to a specified direction are essential. This article presents a system for studying dynamic emotions in human-computer interaction from the perspective of emotional transfer and guidance. Based on the emotional state of the interlocutor and the distribution of emotional transfer, the process of emotional transfer is simulated and sampled, and the sequence of emotional guidance is generated. In this system, two algorithms are proposed. A generative Markov chain Monte Carlo (GEN-MCMC) algorithm is proposed to generate a variety of emotional transfer sequences that fit the talke's personality dynamically based on the real-world dialog. Further, a guiding MCMC (GUI-MCMC) algorithm-based GEN-MCMC is proposed to generate the emotional guiding sequences. The generated emotional sequences by GEN-MCMC were evaluated in two aspects: 1) consistency and 2) diversity. The experimental results show that the GEN-MCMC algorithm performs better than the general sequence generation algorithm in terms of consistency and diversity in generating emotional states. The GUI-MCMC was able to generate a proper stimulus sequence when given the first and target emotions. An emotional stimulus sequence can simulate the emotional transfer of the interlocutor in the process of dialogue, and give the observer appropriate reference to guide and control the emotions of dialogue. The experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively model the dynamic emotion in emotional transfer and guidance, which can be further used to build chat robots, intelligent assistants, and human–machine interaction systems. The models can also be used for emotional induction and enhance the feel-good or feel-terrible factor in human–machine communication applications, such as medical treatment of mental diseases, interrogation, and psychological attack and defense.",

However, traditional neural language models tend to generate a generic reply with poor semantic logic and no emotion. This article proposes an emotional conversation generation model based on a Bayesian deep neural network that can generate replies with rich emotions, clear themes, and diverse sentences. The topic and emotional keywords of the replies are pregenerated by introducing commonsense knowledge in the model. The reply is divided into multiple clauses, and then a multidimensional generator based on the transformer mechanism proposed in this article is used to iteratively generate clauses from two dimensions: sentence granularity and sentence structure. Subjective and objective experiments prove that compared with existing models, the proposed model effectively improves the semantic logic and emotional accuracy of replies. This model also significantly enhances the diversity of replies, largely overcoming the shortcomings of traditional models that generate safe replies.",

      "abstract": "Point cloud analysis has drawn broader attentions due to its increasing demands in various fields. Despite the impressive performance has been achieved on several databases, researchers neglect the fact that the orientation of those point cloud data is aligned. Varying the orientation of point cloud may lead to the degradation of performance, restricting the capacity of generalizing to real applications where the prior of orientation is often unknown. In this paper, we propose the point projection feature, which is invariant to the rotation of the input point cloud. A novel architecture is designed to mine features of different levels. We adopt a PointNet-based backbone to extract global feature for point cloud, and the graph aggregation operation to perceive local shape structure. Besides, we introduce an efficient key point descriptor to assign each point with different response and help recognize the overall geometry. Mathematical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract strictly rotation-invariant representations for point cloud recognition and segmentation without data augmentation, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Point cloud analysis has drawn broader attentions due to its increasing demands in various fields. Despite the impressive performance has been achieved on several databases, researchers neglect the fact that the orientation of those point cloud data is aligned. Varying the orientation of point cloud may lead to the degradation of performance, restricting the capacity of generalizing to real applications where the prior of orientation is often unknown. In this paper, we propose the point projection feature, which is invariant to the rotation of the input point cloud. A novel architecture is designed to mine features of different levels. We adopt a PointNet-based backbone to extract global feature for point cloud, and the graph aggregation operation to perceive local shape structure. Besides, we introduce an efficient key point descriptor to assign each point with different response and help recognize the overall geometry. Mathematical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract strictly rotation-invariant representations for point cloud recognition and segmentation without data augmentation, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "We present a method for human pose tracking that is based on learning spatiotemporal relationships among joints. Beyond generating the heatmap of a joint in a given frame, our system also learns to predict the offset of the joint from a neighboring joint in the frame. Additionally, it is trained to predict the displacement of the joint from its position in the previous frame, in a manner that can account for possibly changing joint appearance, unlike optical flow. These relational cues in the spatial domain and temporal domain are inferred in a robust manner by attending only to relevant areas in the video frames. By explicitly learning and exploiting these joint relationships, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for various pose tracking tasks including 3D body pose tracking in RGB video, 3D hand pose tracking in depth sequences, and 3D hand gesture tracking in RGB video.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment and personality have great impact on our lives; they affect our cognition, creativity, and decision making. Many approaches have been proposed to automatically recognize users' sentiment through images and speech. Accurately predicting a person's sentiment and personality traits can be beneficial for certain situations, such as interviews and polygraphs. In this work, several models including Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory Joint Learning Model, and spatiotemporal hybrid models are proposed to automatically learn galvanic skin response (GSR) and video clips rating for the sentiments recognition and personality detection tasks. Comparisons are made between the proposed model and state-of-the-art models in related works. The experimental results demonstrate that better results of sentiment recognition and personality detection are gained in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score.",

Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) has achieved unprecedented success in the field of computer vision. Recurrent Neural Network(RNNs) and the Attention Mechanism work well for time series tasks. Through investigation a speech emotion recognition(SER) model is proposed in this paper, which based on the CNN, the Long short-term memory(LSTM) and the Attention Mechanism without using any traditional hand-crafted features. Meanwhile, to expand the data set, a new flipping method was proposed for data enhancement. By applying the proposed model and the new data enhancement method to the emotional speech database, the classification result was verified to have better accuracy.",

However, it's hard to swap the local area of face while many of previous work has focused on either generating face from a noise vector which belongs to some kind of data distribution or swaps the whole face. In this paper, we proposed a Cycle-Consistent Region Exchange Generative Adversarial Network(CREGAN) for facial local area exchange in the wild facial database. The Cycle-Consistent guaranteed that the exchanged area keeps the another facial feature and a novel approach to achieve face local region exchange and other region remain unchanged. At the same time, the characteristics of generative adversarial network can make ensure the quality of the generated images. And, it will shows that the generated images can reach photo-realistic results by CREGAN.",

In this paper, a syntactically constrained bidirectional-asynchronous approach for emotional conversation generation (E-SCBA) is proposed to address this issue. In our model, pre-generated emotion keywords and topic keywords are asynchronously introduced into the process of decoding. It is much different from most existing methods which generate replies from the first word to the last. Through experiments, the results indicate that our approach not only improves the diversity of replies, but gains a boost on both logic and emotion compared with baselines.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the generation of conversation content based on deep neural networks has attracted many researchers. However, traditional neural language models tend to generate general replies, lacking logical and emotional factors. This paper proposes a conversation content generation model that combines reinforcement learning with emotional editing constraints to generate more meaningful and customizable emotional replies. The model divides the replies into three clauses based on pre-generated keywords and uses the emotional editor to further optimize the final reply. The model combines multi-task learning with multiple indicator rewards to comprehensively optimize the quality of replies. Experiments shows that our model can not only improve the fluency of the replies, but also significantly enhance the logical relevance and emotional relevance of the replies.",

      "abstract": "Frequent mine disasters cause a large number of casualties and property losses. Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm lacks the detailed and unique description of the object and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection algorithm based on a multiscale conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). The generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multigranularity structure in the generator network. A multiscale shared convolution structure is adopted in the discriminator network to further supervise training the generator. Finally, the Monte Carlo search technique is introduced to search the intermediate state of the generator, and the result is sent to the discriminator for comparison. Compared with the existing work, our model achieved 82.43\\% pixel accuracy and an average intersection-over-union (IOU) of 0.6218, and the detection of the track reached 95.01\\% accuracy in the downhole roadway scene test set.",

By using AdvantEdge FEM software to set the related corn mill cutter blade structure parameters, blade parameters, and network partition, etc. we got the in-process cutting force and temperature simulation figure of spiral corn milling cutter while processing, and on the basis of these simulation parameters, process verification is conducted. The result shows that the analysis of the milling force of spiral corn milling cutter may optimize the cutting parameters, improve the efficiency of difficult-to-machine materials and reduce the tool wear of the cutters while processing TC4 materials.",

      "abstract": "We present a method for human pose tracking that is based on learning spatiotemporal relationships among joints. Beyond generating the heatmap of a joint in a given frame, our system also learns to predict the offset of the joint from a neighboring joint in the frame. Additionally, it is trained to predict the displacement of the joint from its position in the previous frame, in a manner that can account for possibly changing joint appearance, unlike optical flow. These relational cues in the spatial domain and temporal domain are inferred in a robust manner by attending only to relevant areas in the video frames. By explicitly learning and exploiting these joint relationships, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for various pose tracking tasks including 3D body pose tracking in RGB video, 3D hand pose tracking in depth sequences, and 3D hand gesture tracking in RGB video.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. In this paper, we address the semantic segmentation of aerial imagery based on the use of multi-modal data given in the form of true orthophotos and the corresponding Digital Surface Models (DSMs). We present the Deeply-supervised Shuffling Convolutional Neural Network (DSCNN) representing a multi-scale extension of the Shuffling Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) with deep supervision. Thereby, we take the advantage of the SCNN involving the shuffling operator to effectively upsample feature maps and then fuse multiscale features derived from the intermediate layers of the SCNN, which results in the Multi-scale Shuffling Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). Based on the MSCNN, we derive the DSCNN by introducing additional losses into the intermediate layers of the MSCNN. In addition, we investigate the impact of using different sets of hand-crafted radiometric and geometric features derived from the true orthophotos and the DSMs on the semantic segmentation task. For performance evaluation, we use a commonly used benchmark dataset. The achieved results reveal that both multi-scale fusion and deep supervision contribute to an improvement in performance. Furthermore, the use of a diversity of hand-crafted radiometric and geometric features as input for the DSCNN does not provide the best numerical results, but smoother and improved detections for several objects.",

      "abstract": "Accurately recognizing sophisticated sceneries from a rich variety of semantic categories is an indispensable component in many intelligent systems, e.g., scene parsing, video surveillance, and autonomous driving. Recently, there have emerged a large quantity of deep architectures for scene categorization, wherein promising performance has been achieved. However, these models cannot explicitly encode human visual perception toward different sceneries, i.e., the sequence of humans sequentially allocates their gazes. To solve this problem, we propose deep gaze shifting kernel to distinguish sceneries from different categories. Specifically, we first project regions from each scenery into the so-called perceptual space, which is established by combining color, texture, and semantic features. Then, a novel non-negative matrix factorization algorithm is developed which decomposes the regions' feature matrix into the product of the basis matrix and the sparse codes. The sparse codes indicate the saliency level of different regions. In this way, the gaze shifting path from each scenery is derived and an aggregation-based convolutional neural network is designed accordingly to learn its deep representation. Finally, the deep representations of gaze shifting paths from all the scene images are incorporated into an image kernel, which is further fed into a kernel SVM for scene categorization. Comprehensive experiments on six scenery data sets have demonstrated the superiority of our method over a series of shallow/deep recognition models. Besides, eye tracking experiments have shown that our predicted gaze shifting paths are 94.6% consistent with the real human gaze allocations.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence has made a significant breakthrough and progress in the field of humanmachine conversation. However, how to generate high-quality, emotional and subhuman conversation still a troublesome work. The key factor of man-machine dialogue is whether the chatbot can give a good response in content and emotional level. How to ensure that the robot understands the user's emotions, and consider the user's emotions then give a satisfactory response. In this paper, we add the emotional tags to the post and response from the dataset respectively. The emotional tags, as the emotional tags of post and response, represent the emotions expressed by this sentence. The purpose of our emotional tags is to make the chatbot understood the emotion of the input sequence more directly so that it has a recognition of the emotional dimension. In this paper, we apply the mechanism of GAN network on our conversation model. For the generator: We make full use of Encoder-Decoder structure form a seq2seq model, which is used to generate a sentence's response. For the discriminator: distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones.The outputs from the discriminator are used as rewards for the generative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemble human dialogues. We cast our task as an RL(Reinforcement Learning) problem, using a policy gradient method to reward more subhuman conversational sequences, and in addition we have added an emotion tags to represent the response we want to get, which we will use as a rewarding part of it, so that the emotions of real responses can be closer to the emotions we specify. Our experiment shows that through the introduction of emotional intelligence, our model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion, which can be used to control and adjust users emotion. Compared with our previous work, we get a better performance on the same data set, and we get less ''safe'' response than before, but there will be a certain degree of existence.",

      "abstract": "Traditional neural language models tend to generate generic replies with poor logic and no emotion. In this paper, a syntactically constrained bidirectional-asynchronous approach for emotional conversation generation (E-SCBA) is proposed to address this issue. In our model, pre-generated emotion keywords and topic keywords are asynchronously introduced into the process of decoding. It is much different from most existing methods which generate replies from the first word to the last. Through experiments, the results indicate that our approach not only improves the diversity of replies, but gains a boost on both logic and emotion compared with baselines.",

      "abstract": "Video saliency prediction is an indispensable yet challenging technique which can facilitate various applications, such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and realistic rendering. Based on the popularity of embedded cameras, we in this paper predict region-level saliency from videos by leveraging human gaze locations recorded using a camera, (e.g., those equipped on an iMAC and laptop PC). Our proposed camera-assisted mechanism improves saliency prediction by discovering human attended regions inside a video clip. It is orthogonal to the current saliency models, i.e., any existing video/image saliency model can be boosted by our mechanism. First of all, the spatial-and temporal-level visual features are exploited collaboratively for calculating an initial saliency map. We notice that the current saliency models are not sufficiently adaptable to the variations in lighting, different view angles, and complicated backgrounds. Therefore, assisted by a camera tracking human gaze movements, a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm is designed to accurately localize the semantically/visually salient video regions perceived by humans. Finally, the learned human gaze locations as well as the initial saliency map are integrated to optimize video saliency calculation. Empirical results thoroughly demonstrated that: 1) our approach achieves the state-of-the-art video saliency prediction accuracy by outperforming 11 mainstream algorithms considerably and 2) our method can conveniently and successfully enhance video retargeting, quality estimation, and summarization.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the task of 3D human pose estimation in the wild. This task is challenging due to lack of training data, as existing datasets are either in the wild images with 2D pose or in the lab images with 3D pose.,, We propose a weakly-supervised transfer learning method that uses mixed 2D and 3D labels in a unified deep neutral network that presents two-stage cascaded structure. Our network augments a state-of-the-art 2D pose estimation sub-network with a 3D depth regression sub-network. Unlike previous two stage approaches that train the two sub-networks sequentially and separately, our training is end-to-end and fully exploits the correlation between the 2D pose and depth estimation sub-tasks. The deep features are better learnt through shared representations. In doing so, the 3D pose labels in controlled lab environments are transferred to in the wild images. In addition, we introduce a 3D geometric constraint to regularize the 3D pose prediction, which is effective in the absence of ground truth depth labels. Our method achieves competitive results on both 2D and 3D benchmarks.",

This method can not only augment the training data, the relationship between the different ROI areas is helpful to intensify the reliability of the predicted targets. In test stage, we investigated two recognition methods: identify the test image directly; implemented decision fusion strategy on ROI areas. The model we used is fine-tuned from pre-trained deep CNN instead of training from scratch. In addition, we presented an innovative region-based image augmentation method named artificial face to increase the limited database. This method using expression retargeting as an expression-preserving data augmentation which is specific for FER. The performance of the proposed method has been validated on the public CK+ databases.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing due to the complexity of language structure, the semantic structure, and the relative scarcity of labeled data and context information especially in the field of short-text processing. To overcome data sparseness and the over-fitting problem when adopting a deep learning model, we propose multi-granularity text-oriented data augmentation technologies to generate large amounts of data for neural network training. We propose a novel confused model (LSCNN) with the proposed data argumentation technology that improves the performance and outperforms other effective neural network models. The proposed data augmentation method enhances the generalization ability of the proposed model. We also show that the proposed data augmentation method in combination with the neural networks model can achieve astonishing performance without any handcrafted features on cross-domain sentiment analysis, which is a efficient technology for comments sentiment detection.",

The acquired affective lexicon includes emotional words and their lexical semantic relations including synonyms and antonyms. The acquiring method is recursive algorithm using the seed words. The extracted affective lexicon is labeled with affective tendency automatically based on the semantic relations and existing affective dictionaries. We proposed method effectively constructs and clusters the affective lexical semantics for Chinese. The method improves the word number for affective lexicon, and gets automatically and effectively tendency tagging. The experimental results show that the acquired affective semantic lexicon is extended by 166.6% emotional annotation compared to the existing dictionaries, and took 78.1% accurately tendency tagging based on the existing dictionaries.",

      "abstract": "In this work, nitrogen-doped sheetlike carbon materials have been synthesized by a template carbonization method using 1,5-diphenylcarbazide and MgCl2·6H2O as carbon source and template, respectively. The method presents a carbon sample with amorphous characteristics as well as high surface area and large pore volume. More importantly, introducing the redox additives 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), and 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (THBA) with functional hydroxyl groups into 1 mol L–1 H2SO4 has largely improved the capacitances as well as the energy density. As expected, the supercapacitor with the redox additive HBA exhibits higher capacitances, with an increase of 1.57 times compared with the conventional H2SO4 electrolyte. Besides, compared with the supercapacitor without any redox additive, the redox additive DHBA produces a large improvement of capacitances, increasing by 3.18 times. In addition, the redox reactions of HBA and DHBA are reversible, while that of THBA is irreversible. Moreover, HBA with a hydroxyl group can release/gain a proton/electron, and DHBA, which owns a pair of hydroxyl groups, can release two protons/electrons. Moreover, both of the redox processes of HBA and DHBA are controlled by a diffusion mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Affective computing is not only the direction of reform in artificial intelligence but also exemplification of the advanced intelligent machines. Emotion is the biggest difference between human and machine. If the machine behaves with emotion, then the machine will be accepted by more people. Voice is the most natural and can be easily understood and accepted manner in daily communication. The recognition of emotional voice is an important field of artificial intelligence. However, in recognition of emotions, there often exists the phenomenon that two emotions are particularly vulnerable to confusion. This article presents a combined cepstral distance method in two-group multi-class emotion classification for emotional speech recognition. Cepstral distance combined with speech energy is well used as speech signal endpoint detection in speech recognition. In this work, the use of cepstral distance aims to measure the similarity between frames in emotional signals and in neutral signals. These features are input for directed acyclic graph support vector machine classification. Finally, a two-group classification strategy is adopted to solve confusion in multi-emotion recognition. In the experiments, Chinese mandarin emotion database is used and a large training set (1134 + 378 utterances) ensures a powerful modelling capability for predicting emotion. The experimental results show that cepstral distance increases the recognition rate of emotion sad and can balance the recognition results with eliminating the over fitting. And for the German corpus Berlin emotional speech database, the recognition rate between sad and boring, which are very difficult to distinguish, is up to 95.45%.",

      "abstract": "With the rise and popular of artificial intelligence,the technology of conversation between human and machine get more and more attention. Using neural network model on the Encoder-Decoder framework has been wildly used in translation and human-machine conversation. This paper we propose a new hybrid neural network model (HNN) which consists of some essential neural network models (that is RNN, LSTM, and CNN). At the same time, according to the number of words that each sentence contains, we will get three sub-datasets from the original dataset. Then training and testing our models on different sub-datasets. Experimental results show that the best accuracy belongs to different hybrid models on different sub-datasets, which indicate the proposed approach can make use of each models advantages aim at different sub-dataset.",

      "abstract": "The balance of porosity and graphitization toward carbon materials plays acrucial role in determining the capacitive performance. In this work, this purpose has been successfully implemented by adjusting the carbonization temperature and hydrogen gas treatment. Oxygen containing functional groups have conspicuously reduced by the coeffects of hydrogen gas and high temperature on carbon materials. Besides, by treatment at a temperature of 800 °C with hydrogen, the electrochemical performances have been greatly improved. The electrode treated at the temperature of 800 °C with hydrogen displays higher specific capacitances of 171 F g–1 compared with that of bare carbon electrode of 145 F g–1, owing to enlarged BET surface area and pore volume and reduced resistance. At the same time, the electrode treated at the temperature of 800 °C with hydrogen exhibits a higher cycling stability of 96.3% of primary specific capacitances after 5000 cycles and energy density of 8.36 Wh kg–1, respectively.",

      "abstract": "How to massively produce 2D carbon materials remains an interesting issue. In this work, by a template carbonization approach, 2D carbon nanosheets possessing large surface area of 1229 m2 g–1 and high pore volume of 1.66 cm3 g–1 have been synthesized, using sodium stearate as the carbon source and magnesium powder as a hard template. More importantly, dual redox additives KI and anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium (AQS) are developed for remarkably improving the capacitances; neutral KNO3 electrolyte can synchronously extend the operating voltage window. It is revealed that KI and AQS undergo redox reactions at the positive and negative electrodes, respectively; the operating voltage window can be prolonged up to 1.8 V, larger than the limitation of water (1.23 V). Introducing dual redox additives KI and AQS into KNO3 electrolyte results in a high energy density of 33.81 Wh kg–1. The present strategy that utilizes dual redox additives occurring at the positive and negative electrodes respectively has provided us a simple but effective avenue for highly improving the energy density of supercapacitors.",

      "abstract": "Nanoporous carbon material with large specific surface area (2208 m2 g–1) and high pore volume (4.15 cm3 g–1) has been synthesized by the template carbonization method, using a glucose–zinc nitrate complex as the precursor. Moreover, adding redox-mediated ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) to an H2SO4 electrolyte and regulating the potential windows in a two-electrode system can result in an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1499 F g–1 at 10 A g–1 and a high energy density of 58.70 Wh kg–1, which are higher than those of the pristine one without any FAS. These remarkable improvements are attributed to Faradaic pseudocapacitances by the reversible Faradaic reactions of FAS as well as the edge active carbons showing excellent electrosorption toward Fe2+/3+, NH4+, and H+. Furthermore, regulating the potential windows also exerts crucial roles in the capacitive performances. It is revealed that the potential of the −0.5–0.5 V window can lead to optimum capacitance and energy efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, with the development of internet technology and electronic commerce, the Web storages huge number of product reviews comment by customers. Product reviews tend to be more objective in reflecting the real situation of the product, more and more customers post product reviews at merchant websites in order to make an informed choice. However, a large number of reviews made it difficult to track the comments and suggestions that customers made. In this paper, a fine-grained emotional element detection and emotional tendency judgment method based on conditional random fields (CRFs) and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed. This model introduces semantics and word meaning in CRF model to improve the robustness. In SVM model, deep semantic information imported based on neural network to improve the traditional bag of word model. Experimental results show that the proposed model with deep features efficiently improved the F-Measure.",

      "abstract": "Influenza is an acute respiratory illness and widespread activity that occurs every year. Detection and prevention of influenza in its earliest stage would reduce the spread range of the illness. Sina microblog is a popular microblogging service in China, which can be treated as perfect reference sources for flu detection because of its real‐time character. A large number of active users post about their daily life continually. In this paper, we investigate the real‐time flu detection problem and propose a flu detection model with emotion factors and semantic information. First, we extract flu‐related microblog posts automatically in real time by adopting support vector machine (SVM) filter and semantic features. We use association rule mining to extract strongly associated features as additional features for posts to overcome the limitation of 140 words, including sentiment information, which can help us to classify the posts without flu‐related features. Then, the conditional random field model is revised and applied to detect the transition time of flu so that we can find out which place is more likely to have influenza outbreak and when it is more likely to have influenza outbreak in a city or province in China. Experimental results on detecting flu situation during certain times in some locations show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model, which might help health authorities in predicting flu outbreak ahead and take timely control action and response. © 2016 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Emotional state inherent in the text is analyzed to obtain a more accurate result and achieve purposes of emotional analysis. At the same time, to achieve emotional microblog text computability from the aspect of personal characteristics. Experimental results show that the method can improve the microblog text sentiment analysis accuracy and precision. The method is able to get a good application in the different themes and different emotional features.",

This paper describes a database for emotion interactions of the elderly. The database was collected with audio and video from sixteen actors (8 female and 8 male) in daily conversations of TV series, which covers seven type emotions, namely, anger, boredom, happiness, sadness, surprise, neutrality and disgust. The database consists of 810 speech-video excerpts from 118 conversations. Emotion annotations were evaluated by 18 participants (10 men and 8 women). In addition, this databases record the transitions of actors' emotion in daily conversations.",

The problem about what kind of emotion is inspired when people read news is very worthy of discussion. This paper will mix Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to a hybrid neural network model by using the Contrast Divergence (CD) algorithm to estimate the weights when training a generating model, ensure that each layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) mapping the features of the inputs to the best. At the same time, we cascade the last layer of DBN and a SVM classifier to adjust judging performance. And a set of tags will be attached to the top (Associative Memory), through a process of parameter tuning, learn the identifying weights to obtain a network for the task of text classification. The experimental results show that the hybrid neural network model works better than the traditional text categorization method based on simple characteristics (such as CHI), and it is more suitable for extracting text semantic characteristics.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of B2C e-commerce and the popularity of online shopping, the Web storages huge number of product reviews comment by customers. Product reviews contain subjective feelings of customers who have used some products, more and more customers browse a large number of online reviews in order to know other customers word-of-mouth of product and service to make an informed choice. Manufacturers also need accurate user feedback from product reviews to improve their goods. However, a large number of reviews made it difficult for manufacturers or potential customers to track the comments and suggestions that customers made. This paper presents a method for extracting emotional elements containing emotional objects and emotional words and their tendencies from product reviews based on mixed model. First we constructed conditional random fields (CRFs) to extract emotional elements, lead-in semantic and word meaning as features to improve the robustness of feature template and used rules for hierarchical filtering errors. Then we constructed support vector machine (SVM) to classify the emotional tendency of the fine-grained elements to achieve key information from product reviews. Deep semantic information imported based on neural network (NN) to improve the traditional bag of word model. Experimental results show that the proposed model with deep features efficiently improved the F-Measure.",

      "abstract": "The plethora of biomedical relations which are embedded in medical logs (records) demands researchers’ attention. Previous theoretical and practical focuses were restricted on traditional machine learning techniques. However, these methods are susceptible to the issues of “vocabulary gap” and data sparseness and the unattainable automation process in feature extraction. To address aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a multichannel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for automated biomedical relation extraction. The proposed model has the following two contributions: <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> it enables the fusion of multiple (e.g., five) versions in word embeddings; <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> the need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning with convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluated our model on two biomedical relation extraction tasks: drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction and protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction. For DDI task, our system achieved an overall <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-score of 70.2% compared to the standard linear SVM based system (e.g., 67.0%) on DDIExtraction 2013 challenge dataset. And for PPI task, we evaluated our system on Aimed and BioInfer PPI corpus; our system exceeded the state-of-art ensemble SVM system by 2.7% and 5.6% on <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-scores.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates taxi drivers’ multi-day cruising behaviours with GPS data collected in Shenzhen, China. By calculating the inter-daily variability of taxi drivers’ cruising behaviours, the multi-day cruising patterns are investigated. The impacts of learning feature and habitual feature on multi-day cruising behaviours are determined. The results prove that there is variability among taxis’ day-to-day cruising behaviours, and the day-of-week pattern is that taxi drivers tend to cruise a larger area on Friday, and a rather focused area on Monday. The findings also indicate that the impacts of learning feature and habitual feature are more obvious between weekend days than among weekdays. Moreover, learning feature between two sequent weeks is found to be greater than that within one week, while the habitual feature shows recession over time. By revealing taxis' day-to-day cruising pattern and the factors influencing it, the study results provide us with crucial information in predicting taxis' multi-day cruising locations, which can be applied to simulate taxis' multi-day cruising behaviour as well as to determine the traffic volume derived from taxis' cruising behaviour. This can help us in planning of transportation facilities, such as stop stations or parking lots for taxis. Moreover, the findings can be also employed in predicting taxis' adjustments of multi-day cruising locations under the impact of traffic management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Rapidly developing next-generation sequencing technologies significantly promote metagenomics research, yet also present extreme challenges in the analysis of metagenomic data. Metagenomic samples can contain thousands of microbial species, thus, sequencing datasets can contain fragments from thousands of different genomes. Therefore, clustering the sequencing reads with their original genomes, namely, binning, is usually done to expedite further studies. Currently, binning methods are divided into two categories: supervised methods (which require reference genomes), and unsupervised methods (which do not). We present an unsupervised binning method that combines a novel sequence feature recognition method with a spectral clustering algorithm. The sequence feature is a hybrid of sequence correlation and sequence composition analyses. Simulation experiments, based on simulated and actual metagenomic datasets, suggest that the combination of sequence composition and an intrinsic correlation of oligonucleotides, both extracted from tetranucleotide analyses, performs better than any single feature. A spectral clustering algorithm, which is a high performance unsupervised clustering method, is also applied in our binning method. The method is available as an open source package called HSS-bin (Hybrid Sequence feature and Spectral clustering unsupervised metagenomic binning) at http://bioinfo.seu.edu.cn/HSS-bin/. We evaluated HSS-bin’s performance using both simulated and actual metagenomic datasets. Experimental results indicate that HSS-bin can handle metagenomic sequencing data with non-uniform species abundance, short sequences, and complex phylogenetic diversity with high accuracy. Our method performs well on actual metagenomic datasets and on datasets simulated from a complex metagenomic community. Keywords: Metagenomics, unsupervised binning, sequence features, spectral clustering.",

      "abstract": "Related research for sentiment analysis on Chinese microblog is aiming at analyzing the emotion of posters. This paper presents a content extension method that combines post with its' comments into a microblog conversation for sentiment analysis. A new convolutional auto encoder which can extract contextual sentiment information from microblog conversation of the post is proposed. Furthermore, a DBN model, which is composed by several layers of RBM(Restricted Boltzmann Machine) stacked together, is implemented to extract some higher level feature for short text of a post. These RBM layers can encoder observed short text to learn hidden structures or semantics information for better feature representation. A ClassRBM (Classification RBM) layer, which is stacked on top of RBM layers, is adapted to achieve the final sentiment classification. The experiment results demonstrate that, with proper structure and parameter, the performance of the proposed deep learning method on sentiment classification is better than state-of-the-art surface learning models such as SVM or NB, which also proves that DBN is suitable for short-length document classification with the proposed feature dimensionality extension method.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Prophylactic vaccination of youngwomen aged 16 to 26 years with the 9-valent (6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) human papillomavirus (HPV) virus-like particle (9vHPV) vaccine prevents infection and disease. We conducted a noninferiority immunogenicity study to bridge the findings in young women to girls and boys aged 9 to 15 years. METHODS: Subjects (N = 3066) received a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine administered at day 1, month 2, and month 6. Anti-HPV serologic assays were performed at day 1 and month 7. Noninferiority required that the lower bound of 2-sided 95% confidence intervals of geometric mean titer ratios (boys:young women or girls:young women) be &amp;gt;0.67 for each HPV type. Systemic and injection-site adverse experiences (AEs) and serious AEs were monitored. RESULTS: At 4 weeks after dose 3, &amp;gt;99% of girls, boys, and young women seroconverted for each vaccine HPV type. Increases in geometric mean titers to HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 were elicited in all vaccine groups. Responses in girls and boys were noninferior to those of young women. Persistence of anti-HPV responses was demonstrated through 2.5 years after dose 3. Administration of the 9vHPV vaccine was generally well tolerated. A lower proportion of girls (81.9%) and boys (72.8%) than young women (85.4%) reported injection-site AEs, most of which were mild to moderate in intensity. CONCLUSIONS: These data support bridging the efficacy findings with 9vHPV vaccine in young women 16 to 26 years of age to girls and boys 9 to 15 years of age and implementing gender-neutral HPV vaccination programs in preadolescents and adolescents.",

The demonstration of lot-to-lot consistency to confirm the reliability of the manufacturing process is a regulatory requirement for vaccine licensure in the United States. A randomized trial was conducted to demonstrate that three lots of 9vHPV vaccine elicit equivalent antibody response for all 9 vaccine types. The study required thorough planning because it required success on 27 separate statistical comparisons. An innovative statistical approach was used taking into account between-lot variance for more conservative power calculations. The study demonstrated equivalence of three lots of 9vHPV vaccine for all 9 vaccine types.",

Our first contribution is 3D pose-indexed features that generalize the previous 2D parameterized features and achieve better invariance to 3D transformations. Our second contribution is a principled hierarchical regression that is adapted to the articulated object structure. It is therefore more accurate and faster. Comprehensive experiments verify the state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach on the challenging 3D hand pose estimation problem, on a public dataset and our new dataset.",

Pressure-Enthalpy map analysis and thermodynamic calculation showhow the precooling temperature, high pressure and recuperator effectiveness affect thecooling powerat liquid helium temperature. Applying the current performance level of the Stirling cooler,the overall COP of the hybrid cryocooleris roughly optimized. This performance study shows that the hybrid cryocooler can develop its performance potential with improved J-T compressors with larger pressure ratio and aprecooler working at lower temperature.",

For the problem of ideality factor from current report about GaN-based LED, the value of ideality factor n is calculated by using the I-V curve fitting of high voltage LED. And the relationship between the ideality factor and the number of units is series in 12, 19, 51 and 80 V GaN-based high-voltage LED are discussed. In addition, the relationship between ideality factor and spectral half width (FWHM) is analyzed, and the impact of current crowding effect on the ideality factor is also studied. Results show that the ideality factor n increases nearly linearly with the number of units in series, indicating that the ideality factor n of high voltage LED is composed of its series units. It is a valuable result for understanding the ideality factor of GaN-based high voltage LED.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a DBN (deep belief nets) model and a multi-modality feature extraction method to extend features' dimensionalities of short text for Chinese micro blogging sentiment classification. Besides traditional features sets for document classification, comments for certain posts are also extracted as part of the micro blogging features according to the relationship between commenters and posters though constructing micro blogging social network as input information. Then, the integration of the above modality features is combined and represented as input vector for DBN. In this paper, a DBN model, which is stacked with several layers of RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine), is implemented to initialize the structure of neural network. The RBM layers can take probability distribution samples of original data to learn hidden structures for better feature representation. A Class RBM (Classification RBM) layer, which is stacked on top of several RBM layers, is adapted to achieve the final sentiment classification. The results demonstrate that, with proper structure and parameter, the performance of the proposed deep learning method on sentiment classification is better than state of the art surface learning models such as SVM or NB, which proves that DBN is suitable for short-length document classification with the proposed feature dimensionality extension method.",

Three feature selection methods for text modeling are used to build the input vectors of DBN, with the purpose of keeping the text information to the greatest extent. We take advantage of the deep features abstracted by DBN to build social news text classifier. At the same time, three optimal models are used as inputs of SVM to train and classify the social news. We get a conclusion that DBN not only reduces the dimension of original features, but also makes the abstracted features with more text information and shows better performance in determining the influence on people's emotions by social news.",

      "abstract": "Micro-blog is easily posted and communicated because of its short text length. Meanwhile, its brevity limits the feature expression. This paper presents a blogger modeling method for Chinese micro-blog sentiment classification. The paper would adopt a multidimensional strategy to accomplish the feature extraction task. Compared with traditional feature extraction methods and combined with the interactive property of blog, the blog comment will be considered as the performance characteristic of micro-blog emotion expression. It comes to comments content and the relationship between commentators and micro-bloggers while it extracts the micro blogging text feature. At last, the paper adopts fuzzy SVM model to reduce the sensation of noise points and outliers on classification problem. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multidimensional feature extraction method on sentiment classification and the classify effect of fuzzy SVM is better than SVM.",

First we construct conditional random fields (CRFs) to recognize the new words, lead-in features based on character combined with the crowd sourcing network dictionary. And then express word as a word vector based on neural network language model (NNLM) to judge the new word emotional tendency. The experimental results show that the method can improve the precision and recall of the new word detection with a good system performance, and it also provides a new way for forecasting the public mood.",

We used micro-blog emoticon to initial screen large-scale unmarked data, and automatically labeled them into seven types, then used this emotional corpus as training set to train the emotion classifier to classify micro-blog data into multiple emotion categories. The experimental results show that precision of unigram model for each type can reach 63.7%. Meanwhile, different feature selection methods for support vector machines and Naive Bayes classifier experiment have been adopted in the experiment, the precision and recall has reached more than 71%.",

We used predefined micro-blog emoticon sets to initial screen large-scale unmarked data, and automatically labeled them, then used this emotional corpus as training set to train the emotion classifier, which divided micro-blog data into multiple emotion categories. The experimental results show that accuracy rate of using unigram model for each class can reach 63.7%. And the adoption of different feature selection methods for Support Vector Machines and Naive Bias classifier experiment, by which the obtained accuracy rate and recall rate has reached higher than 71%.",

Dealing with microblog data belongs to big data areas. The premise of which is to obtain a large amount of microblog data. For the commercial interests as well as security considerations, the access to the data is becoming increasingly difficult and the Sina officially open API doesn't support large data mining. In this paper, we try to design a platform that is mainly based on the access mechanism of Multi-strategy and existing resources to collect data stably from Sina microblog. The results demonstrate that a combination of API and web crawler allows efficient data mining. In this way, we confirmed that custom solutions will be allowed to build straightforward application of hot words searching and analysis.",

      "abstract": "We present a realtime hand tracking system using a depth sensor. It tracks a fully articulated hand under large viewpoints in realtime (25 FPS on a desktop without using a GPU) and with high accuracy (error below 10 mm). To our knowledge, it is the first system that achieves such robustness, accuracy, and speed simultaneously, as verified on challenging real data. Our system is made of several novel techniques. We model a hand simply using a number of spheres and define a fast cost function. Those are critical for realtime performance. We propose a hybrid method that combines gradient based and stochastic optimization methods to achieve fast convergence and good accuracy. We present new finger detection and hand initialization methods that greatly enhance the robustness of tracking.",

      "abstract": "The recycling of carbon fiber‐reinforced resin matrix composites is attracting more and more attentions, and many mechanical, chemical, and energy recycling methods have been proposed. Among those methods, supercritical solvent recycle technique has been developed recently. Hygrothermal treatment was applied first to the composites before the supercritical process. Numerical simulation method was used to carry out the calculation of the thermal stress, peel stress, and interfacial shear stress under both the hygrothermal and supercritical conditions, to identify the mechanism of structural damage of composites. It shows that the hygrothermal treatment reduced both the critical pressure and temperature, and accelerated the structural damage of composites under the supercritical condition. The temperature and pressure simultaneously impacted the mechanics performance of composites, while the temperature was the dominant factor to destroy the composites' structure. And, potential damage areas were located in the free end with two failure types mainly: interfacial debonding failure and stratified destruction. POLYM.

Sina microblog is a popular microblogging service, provides perfect sources for flu detection due to its real-time nature and large number of users. In this paper we investigate the real-time flu detection problem and describe a Flu model with emotion factors and sematic information (em-flu model). Experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of our method and we are hopeful that it would help health organizations in identifying flu outbreak and take timely actions to control.",

      "abstract": "Extracting semantic polarity of Chinese Multiword Expression, especially some newly generated Multiword Expression from internet(such as weibo or microblog), is an important task for sentiment analysis of web texts or other real word text as some Multiword Expressions can express more integrative sentiments than words units. This paper proposes a method that contains a novel latent discriminative algorithm, which attempts to attack this problem by integrating discriminative model and latent value model. Although Chinese Multiword Expressions consist of multiple words, the semantic polarity of the Multiword Expression is not just simple integration of polarities of the component words, as some words can invert the affective polarity so the Multiword Expressions can have totally opposite semantic polarity, such as ironic texts. In order to capture the property of such Multiword Expressions, hidden semi-CRF which includes a latent valuable layer, which can be used to address dual-sequence labeling tasks synchronously, is adopted. The method is tested experimentally by adopting a manually labeled set of positive and negative Multiword Expressions from microblog or other internet resources, and the experiments have shown very promising results, which is comparable to the best value ever reported.",

      "abstract": "Since Sina microblogging was first launched in August 2009, that seems to have become the major social media communication platform in China, microblogging is increasingly deep into life. In this study, we analyze the sentiment of microbloging hot events based on Ren-CECps. According to hot events in chronological, choosing the microblogging hot events of “Beijing Heavy Fog” and “Xi Jinping, Peng Liyuan Visit” for instance, crawling through sina microblogging we can get the corpus that contains the specified events. The method uses word frequency statistics for access microblogging corpus, analyzing trends in specific keywords concerns. At the same time, according to specific keywords related to micro-Bo, we can calculate the emotions of related microblogging via Ren-CECps. Finally, according to changes from time to time, we make a corresponding data charts, visual display of such trends. In this study, we illustrate that we can get a good result of emotion analysis using Ren-CECps in such a microblogging Chinese text with fragmentation and discrete feature. As a further indication of such excellent Chinese emotion corpus, the practical and research value in it are enormous.",

The variation characteristics of dry density, optimum moisture content and resilient modulus are studied with laboratory experiment. Firstly, set three group weathered mudstone soil with different lime content (4 %, 6 %, 8 %), then compare with the mixed soil of clay and sand, at last, to do the compaction test of each group. The research shows that engineering properties of the strong weathered mudstone is effectively improved. The finite element shows that the settlement and stability of roadbed is obviously improved after replacement with lime soil.&#13;\\n",

      "abstract": "Extracting semantic orientation of Multiword Expression, especially some newly generated Multiword Expression from internet, is an important task for sentiment analysis of web texts or other real word text as some Multiword Expressions can express more integrative sentiments than words units. This paper proposes a method contains a novel latent discriminative algorithm, which attempts to attack this problem by integrating discriminative model and latent value model. Although Chinese Multiword Expressions consist of multiple words, the semantic orientation of the Multiword Expression is not just simple integration of orientations of the component words, as some words can invert the affective orientation so the Multiword Expressions can have totally opposite semantic orientation. In order to capture the property of such Multiword Expressions, hidden semi-CRF which includes a latent valuable layer, which can be used to address dual-sequence labeling tasks synchronously, is adopted. The method is tested experimentally by adopting a manually labeled set of positive and negative Multiword Expressions from microblog or other internet resources, and the experiments have shown very promising results, which is comparable to the best value ever reported.",

However, the performance of segmentation is not so satisfying for MicroBlog corpora. In this paper we describe a scheme for Chinese word segmentation for, MicroBlog which integrates the characterbased and word-based information in the directed graph generated by MMSM model. Word-level information is effective for analysis of known words, while character-level information is useful for analysis of unknown words. A multi-chain unequal states CRF model is proposed. The proposed multi-chain unequal states CRF has two state chains with unequal states which can recognize the POS tag simultaneously. The hybrid model was effective and adopted in real-world system. 1",

Compared with whole sample firm, there are small amount of firm engaging in earnings management and data are uneven for analysis, Weighted Discriminative Model (support vector machine) have been selected to solve this problem. SFS and several feature selection methods have been adopted to select proper feature sets for Weighted Discriminative Model. After feature selection and training, the trained Weighted Discriminative Model is suitable for supporting users such as investor and auditor to detect earnings manipulation. It is also helpful to make correct decision on earning judgment when anglicizing listed company's financial report.",

Furthermore, in view of the weakness of the current real power control theory and technology, two modes, i.e., the real-time and look-ahead control mode are adopted in HAGC. With the establishment of the event-driven mechanism, HAGC integrates control system combining the real-time control mode and the look-ahead control mode, and it can improve real power security, economical and quality efficientily.",

The result shows that if the gasoline engine is fueled with NG torque of the engine decreases and with the throttle opening increases, the decrease amplitude increases. Developing a suitable electronic ignition system can recover engine torque to some extent. Under the conditions that both throttle opening and rotation speed of the engine are constant, MBT angle increases with the decrease of mixture concentration.",

      "abstract": "Isotopic abundances and ratios of He and Ar found in inclusion fluids in pyrites formed in the Yaoling-Meiziwo tungsten miner-alization epoch show that the concentration of 4He varies widely,from 1.54×10-7 cm3 STP/g to 2609×10-7 cm3 STP/g.3He is 0.759×10-12 cm3 STP/g-3.463×10-12 cm3 STP/g.3He/4He is 0.0043-4.362 Ra,varying from crustal to mantle values.The concen-tration of 40Ar ranges from 0.624×10-7 cm3 STP/g to 8.89×10-7 cm3 STP/g.The 40Ar/36Ar varies extensively,from 330 to 2952,between atmospheric and crustal or mantle radiogenic values.Mantle-derived He is present in ore-forming fluids and the calcu-lated average proportion of the mantle He is 22%;the maximum is 67%.Our research results show that mantle-derived fluids play a significant role in tungsten mineralization.The fractionation of He and Ar indicate that there was 4He-enriched air-saturated water(MSAW) in the ore-forming fluid.The ore-forming fluid was a mixture of mantle fluid,crustal magmatic fluid and MSAW.The occurrence of a mantle component in ore-forming fluid indicates the large-scale W and Sn mineralization,including Yaol-ing-Meiziwo,in southeastern China was the result of crust and mantle interaction.The underplating or intrusion of voluminous basaltic magma formed by partial melting of the upper mantle provided the necessary heat to cause partial melting of the crust and the generation of voluminous S-type granitic magmas.Crustal magmatic fluid and mantle fluid with high 3He/4He were released from magma crystallization and fractionation,mixed with the circulating modified air-saturated water,and filled the extensional tectonic fractures,leading to the formation of world-class W and Sn deposits in southeastern China.",

Firstly, constant ignition timing and ignition timing under maximum L.C.L (L.L.T) conditions were compared, then L.L.T conditions were adopted in this paper. The results indicated that for each condition, neither over-retarded nor over-advanced ignition timing are advised in order to achieve leaner combustion. L.C.L increases with hydrogen fraction in the blends, and slightly increases with throttle opening, while decreases when the engine speed is raised",

The measurements were made in air for a range of charge time from 1-8ms, at ambient temperatures. Primary current was measured, so the primary energy can be calculated. Current and voltage signal of secondary circuit was detected, from which the spark energy and energy transformation efficiency can be calculated. Test results show that: when the charge time is 6ms, both the primary energy and spark energy reaches to saturation value, does not advanced any more with the charge time increasing; and the energy transformation efficiency is at an appropriate range.",

The experimental data was conducted under various excessive air coefficient conditions using an electronic ignition system developed self-dependently. The results show that the peak cylinder pressure and peak rate of pressure rise ascends with the increase of spark advance angle in a certain extent, and their corresponding location are advanced. The CO emission keeps almost the same as the spark advance angle varies in the overall mode range. The HC and NOx emissions ascend with the increase of spark advance angle under the condition that excessive air coefficient is near the theoretical value. Under the lean-burn condition, the HC and NOx emissions are almost the same while the spark advance angle varies.",

For existing MT systems, especially Statistic based MT(SBMT), the issue of multiword expressions (MWEs) detection and accurate correspondence from source to target language remains an unsolved problem. Template or Super Function based machine translation system suffer less from the existance of MWEs, but MWEs are still main holdback of MT systems. Our initial experiments on the Chinese-Japanese MT systems reveal that, where MWEs exist, SFBMT system suffer in terms of both efficiency ,comprehensibility and adequacy of finding the translation functions. Statistic based Machine Translation suffers more than SFBMT. For SFBMT systems to become of further practical use, they need to be enhanced with MWEs processing capability. As part of our study towards this goal, we proposed a discriminative latent model, which was developed for sequence labeling task, for identifying and extracting Chinese MWEs. In our evaluation, the tool achieved precisions ranging from 71.46% to 95.87% for different types of MWEs. Such results demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically identify many Chinese MWEs using our tool, Super Function based MT will be further improvement after the Chinese MWEs have been detected.",

The antiviral mechanism of APOBEC3G and the antagonistic mechanism of Vif have drawn great attention. Considering the occurrence of interaction between Vif and APOBEC3G should be based on that these two proteins coexist in the same cells, a eukaryotic bicistronic vector was adopted to express both Vif and APOBEC3G simultaneously. The expression and distribution of Vif and APOBEC3G proteins are detected with fluorescent microscope.",

In stead of rule-based model, we adopt the statistical machine learning method, newly proposed Latent semi-CRF model to solve the Chinese noun phrase chunking problem. The Chinese base phrases could be treated as the sequence labeling problem, which involve the prediction of a class label for each frame in an unsegmented sequence. The Chinese noun phrases have sub-structures which could not be observed in training data. We propose a latent discriminative model called Latent semi-CRF(Latent Semi Conditional Random Fields), which incorporates the advantages of LDCRF(Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Fields) and semi-CRF that model the sub-structure of a class sequence and learn dynamics between class labels, in detecting the Chinese noun phrases. Our results demonstrate that the latent dynamic discriminative model compares favorably to Support Vector Machines, Maximum Entropy Model, and Conditional Random Fields(including LDCRF and semi-CRF) on Chinese noun phrases chunking.",

In order to make Template-based Model more practical and specific, original Template is divided into Template for sentences and Template for phrases to build nested Template-based Machine Translation Model. The existing scope and definition of the variable for original Template-based Model is also extended. From the experiment results, Template-based model is not only effective but also feasible and with considerable precision for Chinese Japanese Machine Translation. The Template-based model can even translate long sentences with complex structure.",

The generation of 2.5 Gb/s optical DPSK and PSK signals, fiber propagation and wireless transmission over 15 GHz subcarrier are illustrated with very low sensitivity of -26 and -32 dBm, respectively. Moreover, based on the wireless polarization diversity techniques, we successfully performed the transmission of 1.3 Gb/s uncompressed high definition television (HDTV) signals with high quality.",

      "abstract": "The safety and immunogenicity of the MRK adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 clade B gag vaccine was assessed in an international Phase I trial. Three-hundred and sixty healthy HIV-uninfected adults were enrolled on five continents. Subjects received placebo or 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> or 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles (vp) per dose of the MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag vaccine at day 1, week 4, and week 26. Immunogenicity was evaluated using an IFN-γ ELISPOT gag 15-mer assay with positive responses defined as ≥55 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs and ≥4-fold over mock control. The vaccine was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were injection site reactions, headache, pyrexia, diarrhea, fatigue, and myalgia. At week 30, geometric mean ELISPOT responses were 24, 114, and 226 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs in the placebo, 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> vp/dose, and 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp/dose groups, respectively. Overall, responses to 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp were 85% and 68% in subjects with low (≤200) and high (>200) baseline Ad5 titers, respectively. The MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag vaccine was immunogenic in diverse geographic regions. Gag ELISPOT responses were greater in the 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp/dose groups than in the 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> vp/dose groups. Data from this first international study indicate that adenovirus-vectored vaccines are well tolerated and may be immunogenic in subjects from regions with high prevalence of preexisting Ad5 immunity.",

      "abstract": "In the fields of Chinese natural language processing, recognizing simple and non-recursive base phrases is an important task for natural language processing applications, such as information processing and machine translation. Instead of rule-based model, we adopt the statistical machine learning method, newly proposed Latent semi-CRF model to solve the Chinese base phrase chunking problem. The Chinese base phrases could be treated as the sequence labeling problem, which involve the prediction of a class label for each frame in an unsegmented sequence. The Chinese base phrases have sub-structures which could not be observed in training data. We propose a latent discriminative model called Latent semi-CRF (Latent Semi Conditional Random Fields), which incorporates the advantages of LDCRF (Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Fields) and semi-CRF that model the sub-structure of a class sequence and learn dynamics between class labels, in detecting the Chinese base phrases. Our results demonstrate that the latent dynamic discriminative model compares favorably to Support Vector Machines, Maximum Entropy Model, and Conditional Random Fields (including LDCRF and semi-CRF) on Chinese base phrases chunking.",

      "abstract": "Chinese new words and their part-of-speech (POS) are particularly problematic in Chinese natural language processing. With the fast development of internet and information technology, it is impossible to get a complete system dictionary for Chinese natural language processing, as new words out of the basic system dictionary are always being created. A latent semi-CRF model, which combines the strengths of LDCRF (Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Field) and semi-CRF, is proposed to detect the new words together with their POS synchronously regardless of the types of the new words from the Chinese text without being pre-segmented. Unlike the original semi-CRF, the LDCRF is applied to generate the candidate entities for training and testing the latent semi-CRF, which accelerates the training speed and decreases the computation cost. The complexity of the latent semi-CRF could be further adjusted by tuning the number of hidden variables in LDCRF and the number of the candidate entities from the Nbest outputs of the LDCRF. A new-words-generating framework is proposed for model training and testing, under which the definitions and distributions of the new words conform to the ones existing in real text. Specific features called “Global Fragment Information” for new word detection and POS tagging are adopted in the model training and testing. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of detecting even low frequency new words together with their POS tags. The proposed model is found to be performing competitively with the state-of-the-art models presented.",

      "abstract": "In Mohoershan Formation(e_2m),Middle Cambrian,3 mafic sills formed during Late Permian to Middle Triassic have been detailed lithologically logged and sampled for geological dating and geochemical analysis in Kuruktag,Tarim basin,Xinjiang,NW China.The mafic sills were composed of lower diabase sill(with thickness of 3m),middle gabbro sill(with thickness of 20m) and upper dolerite sill(with thickness of 2.5m) which intruded into Middle Cambrian strata along the interface of neighboring sedimentary beds.The geochemical characteristics of these sills show great similarities,for instance,the high absolute concentration of total rare earth element(ΣREE = 210×10~(-6)-297×10~(-6)),the enrichment of LREE((La/Yb) _N = 13.54-17.96),weak Eu anomaly(δEu =0.97-1.21),weak positive Ce anomaly(δCe = 1.11-1.25),enrichment of large ion litbophile element(LILE),significant positive anomaly of Sr and negative anomaly for Ta,Nb and Hf.Taking into account the geochemical features as well as the geological settings,these sills derived from same magma source.The magma was formed within the upper mantle and partially contaminated by the lower continental crust according to the standard mineral forming pressure,the REE pattern and trace earth element spider plot.The low MgO content(4%-6%),Mg~#(37.6-55.6) and SI(18.7-29.3) hinted the primary magma had undergone differentiation. The K-Ar age of dolerite sill is about 255.2±7.3Ma,the K-Ar age of diabase sill is about 242.8±5.7Ma and the Ar-Ar age of gabbro sill is about 229.7±3.7Ma.The geological dating results indicated that the magma intrusion took place after the close of south Tianshan ocean,the paleo-teetonic environment is extensional settings of post-collision.",

      "abstract": "The impact of ultimate controlling shareholder on the company's investment is investigated by empirical methods basing on China's A-share listed company's research sample over the period 2005~2008. It shows a significant positive correlation does exist between internal cash flow and investment. Such a sensitivity of investment-cash flow can be explained reasonably by over-investment. In addition,a negative correlation is shown between the sensitivity of investment-cash flow and the ultimate controlling shareholder's right to cash flow,whose convergence of interest effectscan inhibit the over-investment. However,the divergence between the ultimate control right and cash flow right is positive correlation with sensitivity of investment-cash,the fact show that such a divergence makes the ultimate controlling shareholder owing ability and motivation to occupied the interests of listed companies,consequently, leading over-investment more seriously. It is indicates further that the entrenchment effect's occurrence of the ultimate controlling shareholder not only needs ability and motivation,but also requires anopportunitywith sufficient cash flow. The over-investment and the interest capture of the ultimate controlling shareholders can be curbed by less cash flow effectively.",

      "abstract": "A novel ionic liquid bonded polysiloxane ([PSOMIm][NTf2]) was prepared through synthesizing ionic liquid bonded stationary phase with Cl- and a anion exchange reaction to replace the chloride anion with bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide (NTf-2) anion. The polymer was thermal stable and the thermogravimetric test indicated that the [PSOMIm][NTf2] began to decompose slightly after 380 ℃. Then a capillary tube (8 m×0.25 mm i.d.) was coated by static method to prepare a gas chromatographic column. The chromatographic performance was evaluated and demonstrated. The result showed that the [PSOMIm][NTf2] stationary phase exerted good selectivity and high thermal stability for Grob reagent mixture and many types of compounds. The present study suggests that the novel ionic liquid bonded polysiloxane stationary phase has a great potential for further study and application.",

      "abstract": "A strategy combined the oral delivery route and bovine papillomavirus (BPV) pseudovirus (PsV)-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA vaccine, which has been proven to enhance the mucosal immunization compared with the systemic immunization and in general does not induce effective mucosal immune responses. In this study, the immune responses against the BPV expressing HIV gp41 epitopes (ELDKWA, NWFDIT) after oral administration in Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were assessed, and the biodistribution of plasmid DNA encapsulated in the papillomavirus-like particles (VLPs) were evaluated in murine models. Results showed that oral immunization with the HIV-PsV DNA vaccine in monkey generated p24 and gp41 epitopes-specific serum IgG. Importantly, these induced antibodies had been shown to neutralize HIV-1 primary strain. In addition, the advantage of VLPs as vehicles delivering genes had been first revealed in biodistribution results. Therefore, orally administered HIV-PsV DNA vaccine was well-tolerated, enhanced the mucosa targeting property of the plasmid DNA, and reduced the nontargeting distribution, which indicate that it would reduce stress associated with systemic vaccination.",

      "abstract": "Research on machine translation has a long history and many methods and techniques have been proposed and developed. However, low quality of translation is still a major problem and many related problems remain unresolved. Super function based machine translation was proposed to perform translation without going through syntactic and semantic analysis as many machine translation systems usually do. In such way, the import of the errors caused by the syntactic and semantic analysis could be avoided and the readability of the translation is also guaranteed. We continue to extend the super function for the Chinese Japanese machine translation. The super function is divided into the super function for sentences and super function for phrases. The existing scope and definition of the variable for super function is also expanded. The base noun phrases and base verbal phrases are detected and considered when building the super function. The head noun in base noun phrase is treated as variable but the determinative modifiers in base noun phrases are treated as modificatory variables, meanwhile the determinative modifiers in base verb phrases are treated as modificatory variables to build the super function. The revised Levenshtein distance algorithm is proposed for evaluate and find the matching super functions in database for input sentences and the determinative modifiers. The proposed extended super function keeps the advantages of the super function but has less number of super functions for Chinese Japanese machine translation. From the experiment results, the extended super function is not only effective but also feasible and with considerable precision for Chinese Japanese machine translation. The extended super function can even translate long sentences with complex structure for which the completely matching super functions can not be found for translation.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Preexisting immunity to adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) diminishes immune responses to vaccines using Ad5 as a vector. Alternate Ad serotypes as vaccine vectors might overcome Ad5-specific neutralizing antibodies and enhance immune responses in populations with a high prevalence of Ad5 immunity. To test this hypothesis, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative adults were enrolled in a blinded, randomized, dose-escalating, placebo-controlled study. In part A, subjects with baseline Ad6 titers of ≤18 received the Merck Ad6 (MRKAd6) HIV type 1 (HIV-1) trigene vaccine at weeks 0, 4, and 26. In part B, subjects stratified by Ad5 titers (≤200 or &gt;200) and Ad6 titers (≤18 or &gt;18) received the MRKAd5-plus-MRKAd6 (MRKAd5+6) HIV-1 trigene vaccine at weeks 0, 4, and 26. Immunogenicity was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay at week 30. No serious adverse events occurred. MRKAd6 trigene vaccine recipients responded more often to Nef than to Gag or Pol. In part A, ELISPOT response rates to ≥2 vaccine antigens were 14%, 63%, and 71% at 10 9 , 10 10 , and 10 11 viral genomes (vg)/dose, respectively. All responders had positive Nef-specific ELISPOT results. In part B, Nef-ELISPOT response rates at 10 10 vg/dose of the MRKAd5+6 trigene vaccine were 50% in the low-Ad5/low-Ad6 stratum ( n = 8), 78% in the low-Ad5/high-Ad6 stratum ( n = 9), 75% in the high-Ad5/low-Ad6 stratum ( n = 8), and 44% in the high-Ad5/high-Ad6 stratum ( n = 9). The MRKAd6 and MRKAd5+6 trigene vaccines elicited dose-dependent responses predominantly to Nef and were generally well tolerated, indicating that Ad6 should be considered a candidate vector for future vaccines. Although small sample sizes limit the conclusions that can be drawn from this exploratory study, combining two Ad vectors may be a useful vaccine strategy for circumventing isolated immunity to a single Ad serotype.",

Digital image with geometric figures is collected and transmitted into computer. Median filter is used to reduce noise in the original gray scale image. Then image contour with single-pixel width is obtained by image segmentation. Regression function of each detected straight line is obtained by training the SVR with the training point set got from image contour. Then through calculating, we obtain corner points of the geometric figures and angle degree between every two straight lines, which have sub-pixel accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.",

Word-level information is effective for analysis of known words, while character-level information is useful for analysis of unknown words. A Hidden semi-CRF model is proposed for the unknown words detection and POS tagging. The proposed Hidden semi-CRF has two state chains with unequal states which can perform segmentation and POS tagging of unknown words simultaneously. The hybrid model was evaluated using the test data from SIGHAN-6 and achieved higher F-score than the stage-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "As an important image feature, a corner takes significant position in camera calibration, pattern recognition and image matching area. A large amount of image corner points are the intersecting points of the edges of polygons. A corner point extracting method based on support vector for regression (SVR) was proposed aimed at extracting intersecting points. First, a digital image of geometric figures was collected with JAI CV-M4+CL array CCD device under natural lighting, and was transmitted into computer by image grabbing card X64-CLiProTM. Second, the original grey level image with noise was changed into edge information with single-pixel width after it was processed by noise reduction with edge-keeping filter, and then was edge detected with Canny operator and the contour was extracted. Third, regression function of each detected straight segment was obtained by training the SVR with the training point set, which had sub-pixel accuracy. The intersecting points of corresponding straight segments, which are exactly the under-detected corner points, were obtained by simple math works. Experimental results show that the proposed method for corner point extracting has a high accuracy and stability, and a strong robustness. Furthermore, all of the intersecting points can be extracted.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines inducing pathogen-specific cell-mediated immunity are being developed using attenuated adenoviral (Ad) vectors. We report the results of two independent Phase I trials of similar replication-deficient Ad5 vaccines containing a near-consensus HIV-1 clade B gag transgene. Healthy HIV-uninfected adults were enrolled in two separate, multicenter, dose-escalating, blinded, placebo-controlled studies to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a three-dose homologous regimen of Ad5 and MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag vaccines given on day 1, week 4, and week 26. Adverse events were collected for 29 days following each intradeltoid injection. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a positive unfractionated Gag-specific IFN-gamma ELISPOT response measured 4 weeks after the last dose (week 30). Analyses were performed after combining data for each dose group from both protocols, stratifying by baseline Ad5 titers. Overall, 252 subjects were randomized to receive either vaccine or placebo, including 229 subjects (91%) who completed the study through week 30. Tolerability and immunogenicity did not appear to differ between the Ad5 and MRKAd5 vaccines. The frequency of injection-site reactions was dose dependent. Systemic adverse events were also dose dependent and more frequent in subjects with baseline Ad5 titers <200 versus > or =200, especially after the first dose. The percent of ELISPOT responders and the ELISPOT geometric means overall were significantly higher for all four vaccine doses studied compared to placebo, and were generally higher in vaccine recipients with baseline Ad5 titers <200 versus > or = 200. Ad5 titers increased after vaccination in a dose-dependent fashion. Both Ad5-vectored HIV-1 vaccines were generally well tolerated and induced cell-mediated immune responses against HIV Gag-peptides in the majority of healthy adults with baseline Ad5 titers <200. Preexistent and/or vaccine-induced immunity to the Ad5 vector may dampen the CMI response to HIV Gag.",

      "abstract": "In Chinese language processing, new words are particularly problematic. It is impossible to get a complete dictionary as new words can always be created. We proposed a unified dual-chain unequal-state CRF model to detect new words together with their part-of-speech in Chinese texts regardless of the word types such as compound words, abbreviation, person names, etc. The dual-chain unequal-state CRF model has two state chains with unequal number of states. The unequal state chains could model flexible hierarchical lexical information for both Chinese new word detection and POS tagging, and also integrate complex context features like the global information. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of detecting even low frequency new words and their parts-of-speech synchronously with satisfactory results.",

The results of XRD indicate that the sample exhibits a typical face-centered cubic(fcc) silver phase. The results of SEM show that the composite thin films are very homogeneous and the size of Ag and SiO2is small. The thickness of the films is about 1 μm. The results of the optical absorption spectra show that the intensity of the absorption peaks at 420 nm is increasing with the molar ratio of Ag/Si, and the absorption peaks have some red shift. The PL spectra show that the luminescent intensity at 442 nm is very strong and decreases a little with the increase of nAg/nSi. And some blue shift appears. The results of Raman spectra indicate that the surface enhanced Raman scattering(SERS) appears due to the enhancement of the surface region electromagnetic field of Ag nanoparticles.",

Simultaneously, several Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) automata are constructed to recognize all the candidate NEs in Multi-Dimensional instead of single-dimensional context spaces in the directed graph. The Dijkstra algorithm is revised to find the final path in the directed graph with all the candidates NEs and common words. Thus, the recognition of all NEs is accomplished synchronously in an integrative way.",

In this paper, we introduced a novel non-linear regression method: random forest regression (RFR), to quantitatively estimate siRNAs efficacy values. Compared with an alternative machine learning regression algorithm, support vector machine regression (SVR) and four other score-based algorithms (Reynolds et al. (2004), Ui-Tei et al. (2004), Hsieh et al. (2004), Amarzguioui et al. (2004)) our RFR model achieved the best performance of all.",

      "abstract": "Description Logics have been widely applied for its strong abilities of description and mature algorithms in reasoning. However, classical Description Logics are limited in dealing with the crisp concepts and roles, which makes it difficult to analyze imprecise information in Semantic Web or other ontology systems. To some extent, type-1 fuzzy sets can reduce the effect of uncertainties. But it is still not enough. Comparing with type-1 fuzzy theory, system based on type-2 fuzzy sets can describe imprecise knowledge more exactly by using membership degree interval. We present a type-2 fuzzy version of ALC and show the representation and reasoning capabilities of type-2 fuzzy ALC in this paper. Then we use the membership degree interval that is proposed by type-2 fuzzy sets to build the fuzzy ontology system named F-OntoTM for trust management.",

The integrative lexical analysis mechanism extends the Maximum Matching and Second-Maximum Matching model, POS (part of speech) and all the candidate words is included in the directed graph. The Dijkstra algorithm is applied to find the minimum cost path in the directed graph. With the integrative model, word segmentation, POS tagging and unknown words recognition are accomplished synchronously, the conflicts of all tasks of lexical analysis are avoided, high precision can be gained. The open test indicates the precision of the system is 98.65% and recall is 98.96%.",

So the damnification of the diagonal section caused by the cyclic loading is analyzed based on the experiments of 19 reinforced concrete beams.The main varied parameters are reinforcement ratio,shear span and times of cyclic loading.With the times of cyclic loading increasing,the shear capability of the reinforced concrete beams is decreased,while the crack width is increased dramatically.Based on the comparison between the shear capacity test result and the calculation result according to different codes,a coefficient which represents the influence of the cyclic loading on the shear capacity is given.The method consists with the code in use,and can be easily applied to the project.The analytical results can be used for the qualitative evaluation of the shear capability of the reinforced concrete beam after damnification.",

The lexicon is extraordinary important to text classification, There need a real-time-updated lexicon to fit the demand of users. This paper puts forward a new words mining method based on frequent sequence. New words can be accurately extracted from Chinese text with this method. Based on this method researchers can also update the lexicon in time and improve the text classification performance.",

The paper synthesizes different steam power circulations in to a common current process and makes a model for the process. Based on the current mathematic model, a computer software which can simulate and calculate steam power system is developed. Examples show that the program can calculate steam and water's qualities, flux of each unit and heat burden in the system, thus providing reference data for the process power, heat energy, and technical steam. It has an important instructional effect on practical production.",

Thus a network with optimized structure, KANN-GA-BP-ANN (29-3-3-2, n=0.233 3, a=0.974 7), was obtained. By the application of this optimized neural network, the serious overlapping of absorption spectra of coordination complexes of Sr-DBMSA and Ba-DBMSA was effectively resolved and the simultaneous photometric determination of Sr and Ba was achieved without tedious separation. The apparent molar absorptivities of the complexes of Sr and Ba were found to be e_(635)=6.9×10~4L·mol~(-1)·cm~(-1) and e_(634)=8.0×10~4L·mol~(-1)·cm~(-1), respectively. As shown by the result of a comparative study, the ability of KANN-GA-BP-ANN was superior to both BP-ANN and KANN-BP-ANN.",

The quantitative analysis question is regarded as a constrained optimization and is solved by generalized reduced gradient. This method treats the absorptivity and concentration of compound as independent variables, and differs from the conventional optimization method, which only treats the concentration of compound as independent variables. The analysis results of a typical pigment mixtures by this method is that the average and most relative error is 2. 075% and 7. 800% , and the analysis results of that method which only treats the concentration of compound as independent variables is that the average and most relative error is 2. 448% and 10. 200% , which indicates that the new method gives the bettter accurate results than the conventional optimization method.",

The features of several kinds of ultrasonic atomizers are introduced, and the principle of ultrasonic atomization is described in short. The change laws of the acoustics parameters of ultrasonic atomizers are discussed by experiments finding. Based on the experiments data, the change of the acoustics parameters with the atomizer structure size difference is analyzed, and the tested formulas interelaed is found. The principle, however, is more complex, and it is necessary to go on research on ultrasonic atomization so as to solve problems arisen in engineering applications in future.",

The WLAN combining a wireless network for the man-machine coordinated material handling system and an integrated wired network for the manufacturing system were set up in the advanced manufacturing environment. In this system, the stable connection and real-time communication among the various automatic equipments and the material handling station can be realized, so the investment on the existing system modification may be cut down and the substantive rearrangement of the hardware realized. Taking a wireless communication system between a material handling station and a man-driving material transport dolly as an example, the realization method of the information integration was discussed.",

This article discusses GUI modeling and introduces a UML.based Object.Oriented GUI model composed of Frame Controller, View Model and Core Interface (FVI mode) , which supports object.oriented requirement specification and provides a layered, modularized and iterative Object-Oriented GUI design model in terms of GUI Layouts and GUI dynamic interaction tasks. Through an instance of the model, we demonstrate that utilizing UML to implement Object.Oriented FVI mode incorporates GUI design into software process, which improves the integrity and consistence of the software design.",

The experimental results show that the calculated temperatures are in good agreement with the temperature of the blackbody furnace, and the calculated spectral emissivity curves are in good agreement with the spectral transmittance curves of the filters.

      "abstract": "A flexible and efficient architecture for scalable video coding is proposed in this paper, namely, the macroblock (MB) based progressive fine granularity scalable video coding with hybrid temporal SNR scalability (PFGST in short). In order to develop a high efficient hybrid temporal-SNR scalable coding scheme, authors first extend the progressive fine granularity scalable (PFGS) coding from the frame level to the macroblock level, in which the references for temporal prediction and reconstruction are selected per macroblock instead of per frame in the enhancement layer coding. Furthermore, temporal scalability is introduced into the MB based PFGS to form the MB based PFGST. Two modes are proposed for the temporal enhancement macroblocks coding corresponding to the different references used in the temporal prediction. Since it would not cause any error propagation even if using the high quality reference in the temporal enhancement macroblock coding, PFGST can achieve high coding efficiency by choosing the most suitable reference for motion compensation. Experimental results show that the MB based PFGST video coding scheme can significantly improve the coding efficiency up to 2.8dB compared with MPEG 4 FGST, meanwhile supporting SNR, temporal, and hybrid SNR temporal scalabilities to satisfy the different requirements from channels, clients and/or servers.",

The obtained characteristic of emitters is more integral.",

      "abstract": "The backcalculation of pavement layer moduli through genetic algorithms can eliminate the limitation of current algorithms that the result is influenced by initial value. In this paper, the authors discuss the application of genetic algorithms in the backcalculation of pavement layer moduli. The program BACKGA is also presented to apply to the backcalculation of moduli. The result of computation shows that the precision of the result is very good, although the program has a relatively long computation time. Therefore, neural network theory is adopted to compute the deflection of pavement structure layers. The computation speed can be accelerated greatly by using neural network.",

The apparatus has a lowest chamber pressure of 2.0×10-7 Pa, a normal contact load of 1~50 N for a ballondisc point contact configuration, and a continuously adjustable disc rotational speed of 50~3 000 r/min. The pilot test results show that the flux density of the atomic oxygen beam is as high as 3.0×1015 atoms/cm2·s, while the beam energy as high as 1~10 eV at a chamber gas pressure of 10-1~ 10-3 Pa. The comparative evaluation of the friction and endurance of sputtered MoS2 film and MoS2based composite films on the developed test rig and a CZM1 vacuum friction and wear tester indicates that the developed apparatus has good reliability and reproducibility. It can be used to study the tribological properties and failure mechanism of materials in LEO.",

We propose a guideline for choosing an efficient interface mechanism, which is based on the characteristics of management information and Web documents. A Webbased management user interface through embedded Web servers has many advantages such as ubiquity, platform independence and userfriendliness. In order to be truly useful, a Webbased management user interface must have a low development cost and a short development time.",

      "abstract": "Clay minerals from the fine grained surface sediments in the seven lagoons along the coast of Shandong Peninsula were analyzed qualitatively and semi quantitatively. And their characteristics were described. The analysis shows that the percentage of different lay minerals in the surface sediments of the lagoons varies greatly. The percentage of the Smectite decreased regularly from west to east along the coast. The result also shows that the exchange rate capability of the waters between the lagoons and the sea has a great influence on the composition of the clay minerals. There is a quite difference between the clay minerals assemblege of the laycons closed lately and that of the open ones. The result indicates the main influential factors on the clay composition are source sediment, source sediment transport distance and capability of water exchange, and also shows that the lagoon sediments have intimate relationship with environmental dynamic forces and source sediment.",

It has re-lation not only to the measuring method,but also to the calibrating and maintaining methods of radiometers,espe-cially long-wave radiometer. In this paper,two common measuring methods,which are net pyrradiometer measure-ment (NPM) and 4-way component system measurement (4CSM) were used to contrast in the fields. The results show that there are uncertainties in error between two measurements, and its precision changes with time and weather condition. Temperature change and unconsistency of windshield penetrant light spectrum of pyrradiometer are reasons on uncertainty of pyrradiometer.",

This kind of structure can reduce the height and weight of wings and at the same time,maintain the strength and rigidity. Moreover,the application of composite multiweb structures in modern fighters is becoming an inevitable trend because of the various advantages of this material. To solve the problem of buckling,the theory of nonlinear stability of composite laminates and method of rigidity equivalence are adopted in this article. The relevant constitutive equation and nonlinear stability governing equations are established. At last,the nonlinear equations are solved by numerical computation. The overall and local critical loads of buckling are obtained under various boundary conditions and compressive and shear loads in plane. The validity and effectiveness of the theory and method are demonstrated by comparison with the solutions obtained by the other existent references. They can satisfy absolutely the demands of engineering.",

      "abstract": "Two heat flow transitions of polycarbonate (PC) after physical aging have been studied. Sub T g heat flow transition appears at lower temperature and moves to higher temperature with aging time. After long aging time, two heat flow transitions merges into one. Glass temperature changes with the prior cooling rate and there exists and lowest T g. Only when the cooling rate is higher than the rate appearing the lowest T g, sub T g heat flow transition can be observed after aging and it can be ralated to the quench temperature. All these observations are similar to those of epoxy resin. Sub T g heat flow transition could be attributed to the molecular motion of internal stress relaxed chain.",

The polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) base, perdeuterated PMMA base and perfluorinated (PF) polymer base GI POFs are considered for the application of high speed data communications. The attenuation spectrums and loss mechanisms of the GI POFs are introduced. The GI POF forming methods including interfacial gel polymerization technique and two diffusion methods are described and the resultant refractive index profiles are analyzed. The choices of dopants to obtain high stability GI POF are discussed. The recent developments in high stability GI POF are introduced and future research directions are discussed.",

The simulation result showed that it is uncertain that the waveform is sawtooth like as well as asymmetrie under a moderate optic feedback level. Two factors effected the waveform. They are optic feedback level C and linewidth enhancement factor α . This conclusion is significative in the application of self mixing interference technology.",

Using an image processing technique, partial curves of cross-section are extracted from the images of target ingot at various rotating angles. Considering the fluctuation of the rotating axis caused by the gravity, a curve fitting technique is introduced for the reconstruction of the cross-section. In order to deal with the problem of radiant light from the target ingot, a mercury lamp is used as the slit-ray emitter. Experimental results reveal that the system is applicable and the algorithm is feasible.",

Two compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was fitted to the concentration-time profiles of the two formulations. The Pharmacokinetic parameters of the Beijing-made and standard tablets were as following :T_(1/2k_a) = (1.01±0.67) h,T_(1/2β)=(4.81±1.91)h,T_(max)= (3.32±0. 92)h,C_(max)= (4.20±1.77)μg/ml,AUC=(45.89±22.98)(μg·h)/ml,and T_(1/2k_a)=(0.84±0.42)h,T_(1/2β)=(6.30+3.22)h,T_(max)= (3.28±0.79) h,C_(max)=(3.68±1.89)μg/ml, AUC=(41.42±19.35)μg·h)/ml respectively.
