Over time, the work has evolved from early acoustic/visual/text fusion and dimensional emotion prediction toward sophisticated temporal modeling, reasoning chains (e.g., ECR-Chain), human-in-the-loop evaluation, and clinical or mental health applications (e.g., ESCoT). Recent directions integrate LLMs for affective reasoning, style- and sentiment-guided generation, and benchmarks emphasizing temporal dynamics and in-the-wild generalization. A consistent thread is bridging cognitive/psychological principles with deep learning—especially via graph networks, distillation, domain adaptation, and physiological grounding.",

      "abstract": "Underwater visible light communication (UVLC) is a method that uses visible light as a carrier to transmit information through an underwater channel and offers the key advantages of fast speed, low cost and large capacity. The main challenges faced by UVLC systems include the power constraints of underwater terminals and signal distortions due to light attenuation in complex and changing underwater environments. In order to improve the efficiency and robustness of image transmission process in UVLC systems, we propose a novel image compression and reconstruction solution that jointly optimizes coding complexity and image reconstruction quality using neural architecture search (NAS) mechanism. Experimental validations on an UVLC system demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves increased transmission efficiency with reduced algorithmic complexity and offers robustness to errors caused by the underwater channel distortions. For bit error rate (BER) values as high as 1.58 × 10<sup>- 2</sup>, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) remains above 20 dB while structure similarity index measure (SSIM) value is above 0.67, for a compression ratio (CR) of 0.33.",

      "abstract": "We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the value of a radiomics-based machine learning model in detecting Type-B aortic dissection (TBAD) on computed tomography (CT) images. Methodology: This retrospective analysis included one hundred records of patients with clinically diagnosed TBAD and one hundred records of non-TBAD patients treated at the First Hospital of Jiaxing from January 2010 to January 2024. Radiomics features were extracted from CT non-contrast images, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to construct dimensionality reduction and prediction models. The diagnostic performance of the model was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Fifteen radiomics features were extracted from the training cohort. All eight machine learning-established radiomics models in the training cohort demonstrated good prediction accuracy, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.9 in the validation set. Among the three models compared, the AUC values of the nomogram were the highest in both the training and validation cohorts (0.991 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.982-1.000] and 0.998 [95% CI: 0.993-1.000], respectively). The calibration curves of the nomogram in both cohorts were more closely aligned with the dashed line. The nomogram showed the highest clinical benefits in both training and validation cohorts. Conclusions: The predictive model established based on radiomics analysis of CT images demonstrates good predictive ability in recognizing TBAD.KEYWORDS: Type-B aortic dissection; Computed tomography; Radiomics; Machine learning model.",

      "abstract": "Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present ChartM3, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. ChartM3 contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, ChartM3 provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct ChartM3-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available at https://github.com/MLrollIT/ChartM3.",

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence advances from perceptual intelligence to a new phase of cognitive and interactive intelligence, multimodal characteristics and embodied attributes have become key directions for breaking the limitations of traditional intelligent systems. This talk will focus on the in-depth integration of multimodal intelligence and embodied intelligence, highlighting the technical context, cutting-edge challenges, and practical pathways of their collaborative empowerment. The talk will delve into the core logic of multimodal inference, explaining how to achieve in-depth correlation and collaborative decision-making among heterogeneous data such as text, images, and speech. It will also elaborate on the technological breakthroughs of multimodal large language models—from cross-modal semantic alignment to unified understanding in complex scenarios—revealing the value of such models as the core carrier connecting multimodal information and intelligent decision-making. At the same time, the talk will focus on the key capabilities of embodied intelligence in physical world interaction scenarios, including how embodied perception captures environmental details through multi-sensor fusion, how embodied reasoning enables dynamic decision-making based on environmental feedback, the path planning of multimodal embodied navigation in complex and unknown scenarios, and the precise execution of flexible and sophisticated tasks by multimodal embodied manipulation. Additionally, it will analyze the important role of embodied simulation technology: by constructing high-fidelity virtual environments, it reduces the physical training costs of embodied intelligent systems and accelerates algorithm iteration. Finally, the talk will cover the scenario of soft robot control, combining the environmental adaptability of multimodal perception and the dynamic decision-making advantages of embodied reasoning to explore ways to break through technical bottlenecks in soft robots, such as deformation control and force perception accuracy. This will promote the wide application of soft robots in various fields and provide a feasible path for intelligent systems to move from the digital space to the physical world.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis poses a significant global public health challenge, and timely detection and treatment are crucial for preventing fragility fractures in the elderly. However, opportunistic screening remains challenging. Despite rapid deep learning development, its potential in clinical data classification has yet to be fully realized, with traditional machine learning dominating. Therefore, deepening research on deep learning for clinical data recognition in osteoporosis screening holds practical significance. This study utilizes the latest artificial intelligence technology to develop the OPDoctorNet algorithm, combining Transformer and Mamba feature extraction advantages, innovatively proposing multiscale feature fusion and the FeatureBake Block to deeply extract global and local features. The algorithm improves osteoporosis recognition accuracy in clinical data and meets multi-task needs. Results show OPDoctorNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning and other AI methods in accuracy, recall, and F1 scores, with strong robustness and generalization. Through the Innovation of the FeatureBake Block, this study provides a groundbreaking solution for Transformer and Mamba feature processing, enabling efficient, accurate opportunistic osteoporosis screening. Additionally, using SHAP Plot and feature importance mapping for visual analysis enhances interpretability, offering new ideas and methods for osteoporosis screening in clinical practice, aiding accurate, scientific clinical decision-making and promoting deep learning application in clinical data classification.",

      "abstract": "Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck, manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands, limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of motion generation technologies in real-world applications.

      "abstract": "We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes. Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

      "abstract": "Charts are a universally adopted medium for data communication, yet existing chart understanding benchmarks are overwhelmingly English-centric, limiting their accessibility and relevance to global audiences. To address this limitation, we introduce PolyChartQA, the first large-scale multilingual benchmark for chart question answering, comprising 22,606 charts and 26,151 QA pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is constructed through a scalable pipeline that enables efficient multilingual chart generation via data translation and code reuse, supported by LLM-based translation and rigorous quality control. We systematically evaluate multilingual chart understanding with PolyChartQA on state-of-the-art LVLMs and reveal a significant performance gap between English and other languages, particularly low-resource ones. Additionally, we introduce a companion multilingual chart question answering training set, PolyChartQA-Train, on which fine-tuning LVLMs yields substantial gains in multilingual chart understanding across diverse model sizes and architectures. Together, our benchmark provides a foundation for developing globally inclusive vision-language models capable of understanding charts across diverse linguistic contexts.",

      "abstract": "Road damage detection is critical for ensuring the longevity and safety of road infrastructure. However, this task is challenged by factors such as poor image contrast, complex and irregular damage distributions, and minor damage, all of which compromise detection accuracy. To address these issues, we propose DSE-YOLO, an improved road damage detection model built upon YOLOv8. First, we integrate the C2f-DWR module, which enhances multi-scale feature extraction. Next, we incorporate soft nearest neighbor interpolation (SNI) in the feature fusion layer to resolve feature misalignment issues. Additionally, an efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) module embedded in the detection head enhances detection performance in complex scenarios by aggregating pixel-level features through dimensional interaction. Finally, we introduce the Ins-IoU loss function, which prioritizes the shape of bounding boxes and incorporates auxiliary boxes, thereby accelerating convergence and improving regression accuracy. Extensive experiments on two open-source datasets, SVRDD and CNRDD, show that our method outperforms the baseline, with improvements of 4.4% and 5.5% in mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 on the SVRDD dataset, and 4.4% and 4.5% in mAP@50 and F1-Score on the CNRDD dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning, and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from different data types), alignment methods (to match information across modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models). Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas: computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal with real-world complexity.",

      "abstract": "We introduce SPAFormer, an innovative model designed to overcome the combinatorial explosion challenge in the 3D Part Assembly (3D-PA) task. This task requires accu-rate prediction of each part's poses in sequential steps. As the number of parts increases, the possible assembly com-binations increase exponentially, leading to a combinato-rial explosion that severely hinders the efficacy of 3D-PA. SPAFormer addresses this problem by leveraging weak con-straints from assembly sequences, effectively reducing the solution space's complexity. Since the sequence of parts conveys construction rules similar to sentences structured through words, our model explores both parallel and au-toregressive generation. We further strengthen SPAFormer through knowledge enhancement strategies that utilize the attributes of parts and their sequence information, enabling it to capture the inherent assembly pattern and relationships among sequentially ordered parts. We also construct a more challenging benchmark named PartNet-Assembly cov-ering 21 varied categories to more comprehensively val-idate the effectiveness of SPAFormer. Extensive experi-ments demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of SPAFormer, particularly with multi-tasking and in sce-narios requiring long-horizon assembly. Code is available at https://github.com/xuboshen/SPAFormer.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has shown impressive performance in affective computing, but its black-box characteristic limits the model’s interpretability, posing a challenge to further development and application. Compared with objective recognition tasks such as image recognition, emotion perception as a high-level cognition is more subjective, making it particularly important to enhance the interpretability of deep learning in affective computing. In recent years, some interpretability-related works have emerged, but there are few reviews on this topic yet. This article summarizes the explainable deep learning methods in affective computing from two aspects: first, the application of general explainable deep learning methods in affective computing from the perspectives of model-agnostic and model-specific is introduced; second, emotion-specific interpretability research that combines emotional psychology theories, physiological studies, and human cognition, covering task design, model design, and result analysis methods, is systematically reviewed. There are new explainable deep learning methods for multimodal and large language models in the context of emotion. Finally, we discuss five specific challenges and propose corresponding future directions to provide insights and references for subsequent research on affective computing interpretability.",

The data quality plays a role in uncertainty analysis. This paper presents a novel approach to assess the quality of limited experiment data for high explosives. By assigning varying weights to the data based on their quality, we adopt a Bayesian statistical framework to quantify the uncertainties associated with the reactant equation of state for high explosives. The resulting quantification not only elucidates the current physical knowledge but also paves the way for more informed experimental and simulation strategies in future studies. The technique employed in this paper is not limited to high explosives and could be potentially used for uncertainty quantification of other materials.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in using end-to-end acoustic models for singing voice synthesis (SVS). Typically, these models require an additional vocoder to transform the generated acoustic features into the final waveform. However, since the acoustic model and the vocoder are not jointly optimized, a gap can exist between the two models, leading to suboptimal performance. Although a similar problem has been addressed in text-to-speech (TTS) systems through joint training or by replacing acoustic features with a latent representation, adopting these approaches for SVS is challenging. The improvement of joint training in SVS systems has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into how to enhance the joint training of an acoustic model and a vocoder for SVS. We carry out extensive experiments and demonstrate that our joint-training strategy outperforms base-line methods, achieving more stable performance across different datasets while also increasing the interpretability of the entire framework.",

      "abstract": "Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluations are not widely applicable in the research process due to their time-consuming and costly nature. In the field of speech, the rapid development of MOS prediction techniques has enabled the use of pseudo MOS scores for evaluating synthesized audio. However, in singing domain, there remains a paucity of sufficient datasets and relevant research. Consequently, we conduct an investigation into singing MOS prediction using the SingMOS dataset. By systematically examining the impact of different loss functions and various SSL models, we identify the most effective SSL-based backbone for singing MOS prediction. Furthermore, we investigate to incorporate additional features, such as pitch, pitch vari-ance’ and judge, into our model. This comprehensive exploration leads to the development of an optimized MOS predictor tailored specifically for singing MOS prediction tasks, providing a valuable reference for further research.",

      "abstract": "Automatically narrating videos in natural language complying with user requests, i.e. Controllable Video Captioning task, can help people manage massive videos with desired intentions. However, existing works suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the control signal is single-grained which can not satisfy diverse user intentions; 2) the video description is generated in a single round which can not be further edited to meet dynamic needs. In this paper, we propose a novel Video Caption Editing (VCE) task to automatically revise an existing video description guided by multi-grained user requests. Inspired by human writing-revision habits, we design the user command as a pivotal triplet {operation, position, attribute} to cover diverse user needs from coarse-grained to fine-grained. To facilitate the VCE task, we automatically construct an open-domain benchmark dataset named VATEX-EDIT and manually collect an e-commerce dataset called EMMAD-EDIT. We further propose a specialized small-scale model (i.e., OPA) compared with two generalist Large Multi-modal Models to perform an exhaustive analysis of the novel task. For evaluation, we adopt comprehensive metrics considering caption fluency, command-caption consistency, and video-caption alignment. Experiments reveal the task challenges of fine-grained multi-modal semantics understanding and processing. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available at https://github.com/yaolinli/VCE.",

      "abstract": "Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning has advanced in predictive tasks, but practitioners often need to proactively avoid undesired outcomes rather than just predicting them. To this end, a framework called rehearsal has been introduced, which tackles the avoiding undesired future (AUF) problem by modeling how variables influence each other and searching for a decision that leads to desired results. In this paper, we propose a novel rehearsal approach for addressing the AUF problem by making a sequence of decisions, where each decision is dynamically informed by the latest observations via retrospective inference. Theoretically, we show that sequential decisions in our approach tend to achieve a higher success rate in avoiding undesired outcomes by more reliably inferring the outcome of actions compared with existing solutions. Perhaps surprisingly, our approach remains advantageous even under imprecise modeling of relations between variables, and we provide a sufficient condition under which the advantage holds. Finally, experimental results confirm the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach in both simulated and real-world tasks.",

Most existing works either neglect temporal dependencies or suffer from redundancy issues in clip-level recognition. In this work, we propose a novel framework for micro-expression recognition, named the Adaptive Temporal Motion Guided Graph Convolution Network (ATM-GCN). Our framework excels at capturing temporal dependencies between frames across the entire clip, thereby enhancing micro-expression recognition at the clip level. Specifically, the integration of Adaptive Temporal Motion layers empowers our method to aggregate global and local motion features inherent in micro-expressions. Experimental results demonstrate that ATM-GCN not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly on the Composite dataset, but also achieves superior performance on the latest micro-expression dataset CAS(ME)<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>.",

      "abstract": "With the surge in the amount of video data, video summarization techniques,\\nincluding visual-modal(VM) and textual-modal(TM) summarization, are attracting\\nmore and more attention. However, unimodal summarization inevitably loses the\\nrich semantics of the video. In this paper, we focus on a more comprehensive\\nvideo summarization task named Bimodal Semantic Summarization of Videos\\n(BiSSV). Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset, BIDS, in\\n(video, VM-Summary, TM-Summary) triplet format. Unlike traditional processing\\nmethods, our construction procedure contains a VM-Summary extraction algorithm\\naiming to preserve the most salient content within long videos. Based on BIDS,\\nwe propose a Unified framework UBiSS for the BiSSV task, which models the\\nsaliency information in the video and generates a TM-summary and VM-summary\\nsimultaneously. We further optimize our model with a list-wise ranking-based\\nobjective to improve its capacity to capture highlights. Lastly, we propose a\\nmetric, $NDCG_{MS}$, to provide a joint evaluation of the bimodal summary.\\nExperiments show that our unified framework achieves better performance than\\nmulti-stage summarization pipelines.

      "abstract": "Egocentric video-language pretraining is a crucial step in advancing the understanding of hand-object interactions in first-person scenarios. Despite successes on existing testbeds, we find that current EgoVLMs can be easily misled by simple modifications, such as changing the verbs or nouns in interaction descriptions, with models struggling to distinguish between these changes. This raises the question: Do EgoVLMs truly understand hand-object interactions? To address this question, we introduce a benchmark called EgoHOIBench, revealing the performance limitation of current egocentric models when confronted with such challenges. We attribute this performance gap to insufficient fine-grained supervision and the greater difficulty EgoVLMs experience in recognizing verbs compared to nouns. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel asymmetric contrastive objective named EgoNCE++. For the video-to-text objective, we enhance text supervision by generating negative captions using large language models or leveraging pretrained vocabulary for HOI-related word substitutions. For the text-to-video objective, we focus on preserving an object-centric feature space that clusters video representations based on shared nouns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoNCE++ significantly enhances EgoHOI understanding, leading to improved performance across various EgoVLMs in tasks such as multi-instance retrieval, action recognition, and temporal understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/xuboshen/EgoNCEpp.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the process of emotion generation is crucial for analyzing the causes behind emotions. Causal Emotion Entailment (CEE), an emotion-understanding task, aims to identify the causal utterances in a conversation that stimulate the emotions expressed in a target utterance. However, current works in CEE mainly focus on modeling semantic and emotional interactions in conversations, neglecting the exploration of the emotion-generation process. This hinders the models from deeply understanding emotions, restricting their ability to produce explainable predictions. In this work, inspired by the emotion generation process of \"stimulus-appraisal-emotion\" in the cognitive appraisal theory, we introduce a step-by-step reasoning method, Emotion-Cause Reasoning Chain (ECR-Chain), to infer the stimulus from the target emotional expressions in conversations. Specifically, we first introduce the ECR-Chain to ChatGPT via few-shot prompting, which significantly improves its performance on the CEE task. We further propose an automated construction process to utilize ChatGPT in building an ECR-Chain set, which can enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models through supervised training and assist the Vicuna-7B model in achieving state-of-the-art CEE performance. Moreover, our methods can enable these generative language models to effectively perform emotion-cause reasoning in an explainable manner. Our code, data and more details are at https://github.com/hzp3517/ECR-Chain.",

      "abstract": "Charts are important for presenting and explaining complex data relationships. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various chart understanding tasks. However, the sheer size of these models in terms of parameters and computational requirements limits their use in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present TinyChart, an efficient MLLM for chart understanding with only 3B parameters. TinyChart overcomes two key challenges in efficient chart understanding: (1) reduce the burden of learning numerical computations through a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) learning strategy, which trains the model to generate Python programs for numerical calculations, and (2) reduce lengthy vision feature sequences produced by the vision transformer for high-resolution images through a Vision Token Merging module, which gradually merges most similar vision tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 3B TinyChart achieves SOTA performance on a variety of chart understanding benchmarks including ChartQA, Chart-to-Text, Chart-to-Table, OpenCQA, and ChartX. It outperforms several chart understanding MLLM with up to 13B parameters such as ChartLlama and ChartAst, and close-sourced general-purpose MLLM GPT-4V on ChartQA. It also demonstrates its superior efficiency with higher throughput during inference due to a smaller model scale and more efficient vision encoding.

      "abstract": "This work addresses the 3D situated reasoning task which aims to answer questions given egocentric observations in a 3D environment. The task remains challenging as it requires comprehensive 3D perception and complex reasoning skills. End-to-end models trained on supervised data for 3D situated reasoning suffer from data scarcity and generalization ability. Inspired by the recent success of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for visual reasoning, we propose LLM-TPC, a novel framework that leverages the planning, tool usage, and reflection capabilities of LLMs through a ThinkProgram-reCtify loop. The Think phase first decomposes the compositional question into a sequence of steps, and then the Program phase grounds each step to a piece of code and calls carefully designed 3D visual perception modules. Finally, the Rectify phase adjusts the plan and code if the program fails to execute. Experiments and analysis on the SQA3D benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness, interpretability and robustness of our method. Our code is publicly available at https://qingrongh.github.io/LLM-TPC/.",

      "abstract": "Stylized visual captioning aims to generate image or video descriptions with specific styles, making them more attractive and emotionally appropriate. One major challenge with this task is the lack of paired stylized captions for visual content, so most existing works focus on unsupervised methods that do not rely on parallel datasets. However, these approaches still require training with sufficient examples that have style labels, and the generated captions are limited to predefined styles. To address these limitations, we explore the problem of Few-Shot Stylized Visual Captioning, which aims to generate captions in any desired style, using only a few examples as guidance during inference, without requiring further training. We propose a framework called FS-StyleCap for this task, which utilizes a conditional encoder-decoder language model and a visual projection module. Our two-step training scheme proceeds as follows: first, we train a style extractor to generate style representations on an unlabeled text-only corpus. Then, we freeze the extractor and enable our decoder to generate stylized descriptions based on the extracted style vector and projected visual content vectors. During inference, our model can generate desired stylized captions by deriving the style representation from user-supplied examples. Our automatic evaluation results for few-shot sentimental visual captioning outperform state-of-the-art approaches and are comparable to models that are fully trained on labeled style corpora. Human evaluations further confirm our model's ability to handle multiple styles.",

      "abstract": "Conversational Text-to-speech Synthesis (TTS) aims to generate speech with proper style in the user-agent conversation scenario. Although previous works have explored modeling the context in the dialogue history to provide style information for the agent, there are still deficiencies in modeling the role-aware multi-modal context. Moreover, previous works ignore the emotional dependencies between the user and the agent, which includes: 1) agent understands emotional states of users, and 2) agent expresses proper emotion in the generated speech. In this work, we propose an Emotionally Situated Text-to-speech Synthesis (EmoSit-TTS) framework to understand users' semantics and subtle emotional states, and generate speech with proper speaking style and emotional expression in the user-agent conversation. Experiments on the DailyTalk dataset show the superiority of our proposed framework for the user-agent conversational TTS, especially in terms of emotion-aware expressiveness, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by 0.69 on MOS. Demos of our proposed framework are available at https://anonydemo.github.io.",

      "abstract": "We humans are good at translating third-person observations of hand-object interactions (HOI) into an egocentric view. However, current methods struggle to replicate this ability of view adaptation from third-person to first-person. Although some approaches attempt to learn view-agnostic representation from large-scale video datasets, they ignore the relationships among multiple third-person views. To this end, we propose a Prompt-Oriented View-agnostic learning (POV) framework in this paper, which enables this view adaptation with few egocentric videos. Specifically, We introduce interactive masking prompts at the frame level to capture fine-grained action information, and view-aware prompts at the token level to learn view-agnostic representation. To verify our method, we establish two benchmarks for transferring from multiple third-person views to the egocentric view. Our extensive experiments on these benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our POV framework and prompt tuning techniques in terms of view adaptation and view generalization. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/xuboshen/pov_acmmm2023}.",

      "abstract": "To facilitate the research on intelligent and human-like chatbots with multi-modal context, we introduce a new video-based multi-modal dialogue dataset, called TikTalk. We collect 38K videos from a popular video-sharing platform, along with 367K conversations posted by users beneath them. Users engage in spontaneous conversations based on their multi-modal experiences from watching videos, which helps recreate real-world chitchat context. Compared to previous multi-modal dialogue datasets, the richer context types in TikTalk lead to more diverse conversations, but also increase the difficulty in capturing human interests from intricate multi-modal information to generate personalized responses. Moreover, external knowledge is more frequently evoked in our dataset. These facts reveal new challenges for multi-modal dialogue models. We quantitatively demonstrate the characteristics of TikTalk, propose a video-based multi-modal chitchat task, and evaluate several dialogue baselines. Experimental results indicate that the models incorporating large language models (LLM) can generate more diverse responses, while the model utilizing knowledge graphs to introduce external knowledge performs the best overall. Furthermore, no existing model can solve all the above challenges well. There is still a large room for future improvements, even for LLM with visual extensions. Our dataset is available at https://ruc-aimind.github.io/projects/TikTalk/.",

      "abstract": "The task of temporally language grounding (TLG), aiming to locate a video moment within an untrimmed video that matches a given textual query, has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. Typical retrieval-based TLG methods are inefficient due to their reliance on a large number of pre-segmented candidate moments, while localization-based TLG solutions adopt reinforcement learning, resulting in unstable convergence. Meanwhile, the cutting-edge capabilities of multi-modal architecture, especially pre-training paradigm, have not been fully exploited. Therefore, how to perform TLG task efficiently and stably is a non-trivial task. In this work, we propose a novel TLG solution named Multi-modal Multi-Prompt Tuning (MMPT), which formulates the TLG task as a prompt-based multi-modal problem and integrates multiple sub-tasks to tune the performance. In this way, off-the-shelf pre-trained models can be directly leveraged to achieve more stable performance. Specifically, a flexible multi-prompt strategy is contributed to rewrite the query firstly, which contains the query, the start and end timestamps. Among them, various prompt templates are integrated to enhance robustness. Thereafter, a multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fully learn the multi-modal context. Moreover, we design various sub-tasks to optimize this novel framework including the matching task, localization task and joint learning task. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed solution.",

A significant challenge in TVG is the low \"Semantic Noise Ratio (SNR)\", which results in worse performance with lower SNR. Prior works have addressed this challenge using sophisticated techniques. In this paper, we propose a no-frills TVG model that consists of two core modules, namely multi-scale neighboring attention and zoom-in boundary detection. The multi-scale neighboring attention restricts each video token to only aggregate visual contexts from its neighbor, enabling the extraction of the most distinguishing information with multi-scale feature hierarchies from high-ratio noises. The zoom-in boundary detection then focuses on local-wise discrimination of the selected top candidates for fine-grained grounding adjustment. With an end-to-end training strategy, our model achieves competitive performance on different TVG benchmarks, while also having the advantage of faster inference speed and lighter model parameters, thanks to its lightweight architecture.",

      "abstract": "Image-text retrieval, as a fundamental and important branch of information\\nretrieval, has attracted extensive research attentions. The main challenge of\\nthis task is cross-modal semantic understanding and matching. Some recent works\\nfocus more on fine-grained cross-modal semantic matching. With the prevalence\\nof large scale multimodal pretraining models, several state-of-the-art models\\n(e.g. X-VLM) have achieved near-perfect performance on widely-used image-text\\nretrieval benchmarks, i.e. MSCOCO-Test-5K and Flickr30K-Test-1K. In this paper,\\nwe review the two common benchmarks and observe that they are insufficient to\\nassess the true capability of models on fine-grained cross-modal semantic\\nmatching. The reason is that a large amount of images and texts in the\\nbenchmarks are coarse-grained. Based on the observation, we renovate the\\ncoarse-grained images and texts in the old benchmarks and establish the\\nimproved benchmarks called MSCOCO-FG and Flickr30K-FG. Specifically, on the\\nimage side, we enlarge the original image pool by adopting more similar images.\\nOn the text side, we propose a novel semi-automatic renovation approach to\\nrefine coarse-grained sentences into finer-grained ones with little human\\neffort. Furthermore, we evaluate representative image-text retrieval models on\\nour new benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We also\\nanalyze the capability of models on fine-grained semantic comprehension through\\nextensive experiments. The results show that even the state-of-the-art models\\nhave much room for improvement in fine-grained semantic understanding,\\nespecially in distinguishing attributes of close objects in images. Our code\\nand improved benchmark datasets are publicly available at:\\nhttps://github.com/cwj1412/MSCOCO-Flikcr30K_FG, which we hope will inspire\\nfurther in-depth research on cross-modal retrieval.\\n",

      "abstract": "Live video commenting is popular on video media platforms, as it can create a chatting atmosphere and provide supplementary information for users while watching videos. Automatically generating live video comments can improve user experience and enable human-like generation for bot chatting. Existing works mostly focus on short video datasets while ignoring other important video types such as long videos like movies. In this work, we collect a new Movie Live Comments (MovieLC) dataset to support research on live video comment generation for long videos. We also propose a knowledge enhanced generation model inspired by the divergent and informative nature of live video comments. Our model adopts a pre-training encoder-decoder framework and incorporates external knowledge. Extensive experiments show that both objective metrics and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. The MovieLC dataset and our code will be released.",

      "abstract": "The task of keyword-based diverse image retrieval has received considerable attention due to its wide demand in real-world scenarios. Existing methods either rely on a multi-stage re-ranking strategy based on human design to diversify results, or extend sub-semantics via an implicit generator, which either relies on manual labor or lacks explainability. To learn more diverse and explainable representations, we capture sub-semantics in an explicit manner by leveraging the multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) that contains richer entities and relations. However, the huge domain gap between the off-the-shelf MMKG and retrieval datasets, as well as the semantic gap between images and texts, make the fusion of MMKG difficult. In this paper, we pioneer a degree-free hypergraph solution that models many-to-many relations to address the challenge of heterogeneous sources and heterogeneous modalities. Specifically, a hyperlink-based solution, Multi-Modal Knowledge Hyper Graph (MKHG) is proposed, which bridges heterogeneous data via various hyperlinks to diversify sub-semantics. Among them, a hypergraph construction module first customizes various hyperedges to link the heterogeneous MMKG and retrieval databases. A multi-modal instance bagging module then explicitly selects instances to diversify the semantics. Meanwhile, a diverse concept aggregator flexibly adapts key sub-semantics. Finally, several losses are adopted to optimize the semantic space. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets have well verified the effectiveness and explainability of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal processing has attracted much attention lately especially with the success of pre-training. However, the exploration has mainly focused on vision-language pre-training, as introducing more modalities can greatly complicate model design and optimization. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art Vision-Language model CLIP to accommodate the audio modality for Vision-Language-Audio multimodal processing. Specifically, we apply inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive learning to explore the correlation between audio and other modalities in addition to the inner characteristics of the audio modality. Moreover, we further design an audio type token to dynamically learn different audio information type for different scenarios, as both verbal and nonverbal heterogeneous information is conveyed in general audios. Our proposed CLIP4VLA model is validated in different downstream tasks including video retrieval and video captioning, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT, VATEX, and Audiocaps.The corresponding code and checkpoints will be released at https://github.com/ludanruan/CLIP4VLA.",

      "abstract": "Applying large scale pre-trained image-language model to video-language tasks has recently become a trend, which brings two challenges. One is how to effectively transfer knowledge from static images to dynamic videos, and the other is how to deal with the prohibitive cost of fully fine-tuning due to growing model size. Existing works that attempt to realize parameter-efficient image-language to video-language transfer learning can be categorized into two types: 1) appending a sequence of temporal transformer blocks after the 2D Vision Transformer (ViT), and 2) inserting a temporal block into the ViT architecture. While these two types of methods only require fine-tuning the newly added components, there are still many parameters to update, and they are only validated on a single video-language task. In this work, based on our analysis of the core ideas of different temporal modeling components in existing approaches, we propose a token mixing strategy to enable cross-frame interactions, which enables transferring from the pre-trained image-language model to video-language tasks through selecting and mixing a key set and a value set from the input video samples. As token mixing does not require the addition of any components or modules, we can directly partially fine-tune the pre-trained image-language model to achieve parameter-efficiency. We carry out extensive experiments to compare our proposed token mixing method with other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods. Our token mixing method outperforms other methods on both understanding tasks and generation tasks. Besides, our method achieves new records on multiple video-language tasks.

      "abstract": "We propose the first joint audio-video generation framework that brings engaging watching and listening experiences simultaneously, towards high-quality realistic videos. To generate joint audio-video pairs, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Diffusion model (i.e., MM-Diffusion), with two-coupled denoising autoencoders. In contrast to existing single-modal diffusion models, MM-Diffusion consists of a sequential multi-modal U-Net for a joint denoising process by design. Two subnets for audio and video learn to gradually generate aligned audio-video pairs from Gaussian noises. To ensure semantic consistency across modalities, we propose a novel random-shift based attention block bridging over the two subnets, which enables efficient cross-modal alignment, and thus reinforces the audio-video fidelity for each other. Extensive experiments show superior results in unconditional audio-video generation, and zeroshot conditional tasks (e.g., video-to-audio). In particular, we achieve the best FVD and FAD on Landscape and AIST++ dancing datasets. Turing tests of 10k votes further demonstrate dominant preferences for our model. The code and pre-trained models can be downloaded at https://github.com/researchmm/MM-Diffusion.",

      "abstract": "Human-object interaction (HOI) has long been plagued by the conflict between limited supervised data and a vast number of possible interaction combinations in real life. Current methods trained from closed-set data predict HOIs as fixed-dimension log its, which restricts their scalability to open-set categories. To address this issue, we introduce Open Cat, a language modeling framework that reformulates HOI prediction as sequence generation. By converting HOI triplets into a token sequence through a serialization scheme, our model is able to exploit the open-set vocabulary of the language modeling framework to predict novel interaction classes with a high degree of freedom. In addition, inspired by the great success of vision-language pre-training, we collect a large amount of weakly-supervised data related to HOI from image-caption pairs, and devise several auxiliary proxy tasks, including soft relational matching and human-object relation prediction, to pre-train our model. Extensive experiments show that our OpenCat significantly boosts HOI performance, particularly on a broad range of rare and unseen categories.",

SVS faces the challenge that the singing has various pronunciation flexibility conditioned on the same music score. Most of the previous works of SVS can not well handle the misalignment between the music score and actual singing. In this paper, we propose an acoustic feature processing strategy, named PHONEix, with a phoneme distribution predictor, to alleviate the gap between the music score and the singing voice, which can be easily adopted in different SVS systems. Extensive experiments in various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our PHONEix in both objective and subjective evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Automatically generating textual descriptions for massive unlabeled images on the web can greatly benefit realistic web applications, e.g. multimodal retrieval and recommendation. However, existing models suffer from the problem of generating \"over-generic\" descriptions, such as their tendency to generate repetitive sentences with common concepts for different images. These generic descriptions fail to provide sufficient textual semantics for ever-changing web images. Inspired by the recent success of Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models that learn diverse image-text concept alignment during pretraining, we explore leveraging their cross-modal pre-trained knowledge to automatically enrich the textual semantics of image descriptions. With no need for additional human annotations, we propose a plug-and-play framework, i.e CapEnrich, to complement the generic image descriptions with more semantic details. Specifically, we first propose an automatic data-building strategy to get desired training sentences, based on which we then adopt prompting strategies, i.e. learnable and template prompts, to incentivize VLP models to generate more textual details. For learnable templates, we fix the whole VLP model and only tune the prompt vectors, which leads to two advantages: 1) the pre-training knowledge of VLP models can be reserved as much as possible to describe diverse visual concepts; 2) only lightweight trainable parameters are required, so it is friendly to low data resources. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the descriptiveness and diversity of generated sentences for web images. The code is available at https://github.com/yaolinli/CapEnrich.",

      "abstract": "Most research on stylized image captioning aims to generate style-specific captions using unpaired text, and has achieved impressive performance for simple styles like positive and negative. However, unlike previous single-sentence captions whose style is mostly embodied in distinctive words or phrases, real-world styles are likely to be implied at the syntactic and discourse levels. In this work, we introduce a new task of Stylized Visual Storytelling (SVST), which aims to describe a photo stream with stylized stories that are more expressive and attractive. We propose a multitasking memory-augmented framework called StyleVSG, which is jointly trained on factual visual storytelling data and unpaired style corpus, achieving a trade-off between style accuracy and visual relevance. Particularly for unpaired stylized text, StyleVSG learns to reconstruct the stylistic story from roughly parallel visual inputs mined with the CLIP model, avoiding problems caused by random mapping in previous methods. Furthermore, a memory module is designed to preserve the consistency and coherence of generated stories. Experiments show that our method can generate attractive and coherent stories with different styles such as fairy tale, romance, and humor. The overall performance of our StyleVSG surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both automatic and human evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "Understanding human and the surrounding context is crucial for the perception of the image and video. It benefits many related applications, such as person search, virtual tryon/makeup, abnormal action detection. In the proposed 4th Person in Context (PIC) workshop, to further promote the progress in the above-mentioned areas, we hold three human-centric perception and cognition challenges including Make-up Temporal Video Grounding (MTVG), Make-up Dense Video Caption (MDVC) and Human-centric Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (HC-STVG). All the human-centric challenges focus on understanding the human behavior, interactions and relationships in video sequences, which requires understanding both visual and linguistic information, as well as complicated multimodal reasoning. The three sub-problems are complementary and collaboratively contribute to a unified human-centric perception and cognition solution.",

      "abstract": "Image retrieval with hybrid-modality queries, also known as composing text and image for image retrieval (CTI-IR), is a retrieval task where the search intention is expressed in a more complex query format, involving both vision and text modalities. For example, a target product image is searched using a reference product image along with text about changing certain attributes of the reference image as the query. It is a more challenging image retrieval task that requires both semantic space learning and cross-modal fusion. Previous approaches that attempt to deal with both aspects achieve unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we decompose the CTI-IR task into a three-stage learning problem to progressively learn the complex knowledge for image retrieval with hybrid-modality queries. We first leverage the semantic embedding space for open-domain image-text retrieval, and then transfer the learned knowledge to the fashion-domain with fashion-related pre-training tasks. Finally, we enhance the pre-trained model from single-query to hybrid-modality query for the CTI-IR task. Furthermore, as the contribution of individual modality in the hybrid-modality query varies for different retrieval scenarios, we propose a self-supervised adaptive weighting strategy to dynamically determine the importance of image and text in the hybrid-modality query for better retrieval. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the mean of [email protected] by 24.9% and 9.5% on the Fashion-IQ and Shoes benchmark datasets respectively.",

Based on multimodal feature representations that fuse the visual and aural information, we utilize two types of temporal encoder to capture the temporal context information in the video, including the transformer based encoder and LSTM based encoder. With the temporal context-aware representations, we employ fully-connected layers to predict the valence and arousal values of the video frames. In addition, smoothing processing is applied to refine the initial predictions, and a model ensemble strategy is used to combine multiple results from different model setups. Our system achieves the performance in Concordance Correlation Coefficients (ccc) of 0.606 for valence, 0.602 for arousal, and mean ccc of 0.601, which ranks the first place in the challenge.",

      "abstract": "Visual relation understanding plays an essential role for holistic video understanding. Most previous works adopt a multi-stage framework for video visual relation detection (VidVRD), which cannot capture long-term spatio-temporal contexts in different stages and also suffers from inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based framework called VRDFormer to unify these decoupling stages. Our model exploits a query-based approach to autoregressively generate relation instances. We specifically design static queries and recurrent queries to enable efficient object pair tracking with spatio-temporal contexts. The model is jointly trained with object pair detection and relation classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet-VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VRDFormer, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both relation detection and relation tagging tasks. The code is released at https://github.com/zhengsipeng/VRDFormer_VRD.",

In this paper, we propose a multimodal pre-training model MEmoBERT for multimodal emotion recognition, which learns multimodal joint representations through self-supervised learning from a self-collected large-scale unlabeled video data that come in sheer volume. Furthermore, unlike the conventional \"pre-train, finetune\" paradigm, we propose a prompt-based method that reformulates the downstream emotion classification task as a masked text prediction one, bringing the downstream task closer to the pre-training. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV, show that our proposed MEmoBERT significantly enhances emotion recognition performance.",

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of the feature extraction algorithm based on wavelet coefficients has been proven efficient on both regression and classification tasks. In this work, we improve the discriminative ability of the algorithm by introducing Shannon's entropy. We tested the performance of the improved algorithm on five physiological signals related to human pain, including GSR, ECG, EMG Trapezoid, EMG Corrugator, and EMG Zygomaticus. We used support vector machine(SVM) and feedforward neural network to classify the signals. We compared the classification accuracy of the original and the revised algorithm. The proposed method has proven to perform better than the original algorithm on EMG Trapezoid, EMG Corrugator, and EMG Zygomaticus signals, The average improvement is approximately 2.21%. For GSR and ECG signals, both algorithm performed at the same level.--Author's abstract",

It is a challenging task due to the semantic gap between different modalities and diversity of the event duration. Proposal generation plays an important role in previous mainstream methods. However, previous proposal generation methods apply the same feature extraction without considering the diversity of event duration. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal sentence grounding model with an U-shaped Network for efficient proposal generation (UN-TSG), which utilizes U-shaped structure to encode proposals of different lengths hierarchically. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that with more efficient proposal generation method, our model can achieve the state-of-the-art grounding performance in faster speed and with less computation cost.",

      "abstract": "Translating e-commercial product descriptions, a.k.a product-oriented machine translation (PMT), is essential to serve e-shoppers all over the world. However, due to the domain specialty, the PMT task is more challenging than traditional machine translation problems. Firstly, there are many specialized jargons in the product description, which are ambiguous to translate without the product image. Secondly, product descriptions are related to the image in more complicated ways than standard image descriptions, involving various visual aspects such as objects, shapes, colors or even subjective styles. Moreover, existing PMT datasets are small in scale to support the research. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale bilingual product description dataset called Fashion-MMT, which contains over 114k noisy and 40k manually cleaned description translations with multiple product images. To effectively learn semantic alignments among product images and bilingual texts in translation, we design a unified product-oriented cross-modal cross-lingual model for pre-training and fine-tuning. Experiments on the Fashion-MMT and Multi30k datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models even pre-trained on the same dataset. It is also shown to benefit more from large-scale noisy data to improve the translation quality. We will release the dataset and codes at https://github.com/syuqings/Fashion-MMT.",

      "abstract": "For an image with multiple scene texts, different people may be interested in different text information. Current text-aware image captioning models are not able to generate distinctive captions according to various information needs. To explore how to generate personalized text-aware captions, we define a new challenging task, namely Question-controlled Text-aware Image Captioning (Qc-TextCap). With questions as control signals, this task requires models to understand questions, find related scene texts and describe them together with objects fluently in human language. Based on two existing text-aware captioning datasets, we automatically construct two datasets, ControlTextCaps and ControlVizWiz to support the task. We propose a novel Geometry and Question Aware Model (GQAM). GQAM first applies a Geometry-informed Visual Encoder to fuse region-level object features and region-level scene text features with considering spatial relationships. Then, we design a Question-guided Encoder to select the most relevant visual features for each question. Finally, GQAM generates a personalized text-aware caption with a Multimodal Decoder. Our model achieves better captioning performance and question answering ability than carefully designed baselines on both two datasets. With questions as control signals, our model generates more informative and diverse captions than the state-of-the-art text-aware captioning model. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/HAWLYQ/Qc-TextCap.",

      "abstract": "Physiological-emotion analysis is a novel aspect of automatic emotion analysis. It can support revealing a subject's emotional state, even if he/she consciously suppresses the emotional expression. In this paper, we present our solutions for the MuSe-Physio sub-challenge of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MuSe) 2021. The aim of this task is to predict the level of psycho-physiological arousal from combined audio-visual signals and the galvanic skin response (also known as Electrodermal Activity signals) of subjects under a highly stress-induced free speech scenario. In the scenarios, the speaker's emotion can be conveyed in different modalities including acoustic, visual, textual, and physiological signal modalities. Due to the complementarity of different modalities, the fusion of the multiple modalities has a large impact on emotion analysis. In this paper, we highlight two aspects of our solutions: 1) we explore various efficient low-level and high-level features from different modalities for this task, 2) we propose two effective multi-modal fusion strategies to make full use of the different modalities. Our solutions achieve the best CCC performance of 0.5728 on the challenge testing set, which significantly outperforms the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.4908. The experimental results show that our proposed various effective features and efficient fusion strategies have a strong generalization ability and can bring more robust performance.",

In the last few years, we have witnessed many research works on multi-modal pre-training which have achieved state-of-the-art performances on many multimedia tasks (e.g., image-text retrieval, video localization, speech recognition). In this workshop, we aim to gather peer researchers on related topics for more insightful discussion. We also intend to attract more researchers to explore and investigate more opportunities of designing and using innovative pre-training models for multimedia tasks.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural network has been widely used in hyperspectral image classification. Compared with the early machine learning method, it has made great progress. However, the convolution kernel used in hyperspectral image classification ignores the intrinsic relationship among spatial pixels when extracting spectral features, which will lead to poor contour and very small false prediction in the classification results. Besides, The hyperspectral data can only be labeled by experts, which requires a lot of labor and material resources. In order to improve the classification accuracy of hyperspectral images and reduce the dependence on labeled samples, this paper proposed a hyperspectral image classification algorithm based on graph neural network. Through the characteristics of inherent points and edges in the graph, the spatial information and spectral information of hyperspectral images are fused. The features of unlabeled samples are used to participate in the training to improve the effect of classification model.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal machine translation (MMT) aims to translate a sentence in the source language into the target language with the context of an associated image. According to where the visual information is employed, previous approaches can be categorized into two types: directly injecting the visual information at the input side or exploiting it as a visual constraint at the objective side. In this work, we propose an IO-MMT model which exploits the visual assistance in dual sides to fully exploit the visual information for multimodal machine translation. It contains a relation-aware multimodal transformer to simultaneously exploit the objects and their spatial relationships in the image with a graph at the input-side and a novel visual assistance structure to further improve visual consistency of the translation at the objective-side. Experimental results under both normal setting and input degradation settings on the Multi30k benchmark dataset show that combining the visual assistance in dual sides consistently outperforms single-side MMT models and achieves the state-of-the-art results on EN-DE and EN-FR translation tasks. We will release the codes and models at https://github.com/syuqings/MMT.",

      "abstract": "Entities Object Localization (EOL) aims to evaluate how grounded or faithful a description is, which consists of caption generation and object grounding. Previous works tackle this problem by jointly training the two modules in a framework, which limits the complexity of each module. Therefore, in this work, we propose to divide these two modules into two stages and improve them respectively to boost the whole system performance. For the caption generation, we propose a Unified Multi-modal Pre-training Model (UMPM) to generate event descriptions with rich objects for better localization. For the object grounding, we fine-tune the state-of-the-art detection model MDETR and design a post processing method to make the grounding results more faithful. Our overall system achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both sub-tasks in Entities Object Localization challenge at Activitynet 2021, with 72.57 localization accuracy on the testing set of sub-task I and 0.2477 F1_all_per_sent on the hidden testing set of sub-task II.",

      "abstract": "Video paragraph captioning aims to describe multiple events in untrimmed videos with descriptive paragraphs. Existing approaches mainly solve the problem in two steps: event detection and then event captioning. Such two-step manner makes the quality of generated paragraphs highly dependent on the accuracy of event proposal detection which is already a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a paragraph captioning model which eschews the problematic event detection stage and directly generates paragraphs for untrimmed videos. To describe coherent and diverse events, we propose to enhance the conventional temporal attention with dynamic video memories, which progressively exposes new video features and suppresses over-accessed video contents to control visual focuses of the model. In addition, a diversity-driven training strategy is proposed to improve diversity of paragraph on the language perspective. Considering that untrimmed videos generally contain massive but redundant frames, we further augment the video encoder with keyframe awareness to improve efficiency. Experimental results on the ActivityNet and Charades datasets show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on both accuracy and diversity metrics without using any event boundary annotations.

      "abstract": "The neural network (NN) based singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems require sufficient data to train well and are are prone to over-fitting due to data scarcity. However, we often encounter data limitation problem in building SVS systems because of high data acquisition and annotation cost,. In this work, we propose a Perceptual Entropy (PE) loss derived from a psycho-acoustic hearing model to regularize the network. With a one-hour open-source singing voice database, we explore the impact of the PE loss on various main-stream sequence-to-sequence models, including the RNN-based, transformer-based, and conformer-based models. Our experiments show that the PE loss can mitigate the over-fitting problem and significantly improve the synthesized singing quality reflected in objective and subjective evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT have recently achieved great success and become a milestone in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge model parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from massive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters and fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in huge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been extensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis. It is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for downstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we take a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special relation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the crucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we comprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs are driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability of data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures, utilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting interpretation and theoretical analysis. Finally, we discuss a series of open problems and research directions of PTMs, and hope our view can inspire and advance the future study of PTMs.",

      "abstract": "Due to complex cognitive and inferential efforts involved in the manual generation of one caption per image/video input, the human annotation resources are very limited for captioning tasks. We define language resource efficient as reaching the same performance with fewer annotated captions per input. We first study the performance degradation of caption models in different language resource settings. Our analysis of caption models with SC loss shows that the performance degradation is caused by the increasingly noisy estimation of reward and baseline with fewer language resources. To mitigate this issue, we propose to reduce the variance of noise in the baseline by generalizing the single pairwise comparison in SC loss and using multiple generalized pairwise comparisons. The generalized pairwise comparison (GPC) measures the difference between the evaluation scores of two captions with respect to an input. Empirically, we show that the model trained with the proposed GPC loss is efficient on language resource and achieves similar performance with the state-of-the-art models on MSCOCO by using only half of the language resources. Furthermore, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on a video caption dataset that has only one labeled caption per input in the training set.",

      "abstract": "Mispronunciation detection is an essential component of the Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems.State-of-the-art mispronunciation detection models use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for acoustic modeling, and a Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) based algorithm for pronunciation scoring.However, GOP based scoring models have two major limitations: i.e., (i) They depend on forced alignment which splits the speech into phonetic segments and independently use them for scoring, which neglects the transitions between phonemes within the segment; (ii) They only focus on phonetic segments, which fails to consider the context effects across phonemes (such as liaison, omission, incomplete plosive sound, etc.).In this work, we propose the Context-aware Goodness of Pronunciation (CaGOP) scoring model.Particularly, two factors namely the transition factor and the duration factor are injected into CaGOP scoring.The transition factor identifies the transitions between phonemes and applies them to weight the frame-wise GOP.Moreover, a self-attention based phonetic duration modeling is proposed to introduce the duration factor into the scoring model.The proposed scoring model significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 20% and 12% relative improvement over the GOP model on the phoneme-level and sentence-level mispronunciation detection respectively.",

      "abstract": "Automatic sentiment analysis can support revealing a subject's emotional state and opinion tendency toward an entity. In this paper, we present our solutions for the MuSe-Wild sub-challenge of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Real-life Media (MuSe) 2020. The videos in this challenge are collected from YouTube about emotional car reviews. In the scenarios, the speaker's sentiment can be conveyed in different modalities including acoustic, visual, and textual modalities. Due to the complementarity of different modalities, the fusion of the multiple modalities has a large impact on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we highlight two aspects of our solutions: 1) we explore various low-level and high-level features from different modalities for emotional state recognition, such as expert-defined low-level descriptors (LLD) and deep learned features, etc. 2) we propose several effective multi-modal fusion strategies to make full use of the different modalities. Our solutions achieve the best CCC performance of 0.4346 and 0.4513 on arousal and valence respectively on the challenge testing set, which significantly outperforms the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.2843 and 0.2413 on arousal and valence. The experimental results show that our proposed various effective representations of different modalities and fusion strategies have a strong generalization ability and can bring more robust performance.",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition is an active research topic with wide range of\\napplications. Due to the high manual annotation cost and inevitable label\\nambiguity, the development of emotion recognition dataset is limited in both\\nscale and quality. Therefore, one of the key challenges is how to build\\neffective models with limited data resource. Previous works have explored\\ndifferent approaches to tackle this challenge including data enhancement,\\ntransfer learning, and semi-supervised learning etc. However, the weakness of\\nthese existing approaches includes such as training instability, large\\nperformance loss during transfer, or marginal improvement.\\n In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal emotion\\nrecognition model based on cross-modality distribution matching, which\\nleverages abundant unlabeled data to enhance the model training under the\\nassumption that the inner emotional status is consistent at the utterance level\\nacross modalities.\\n We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model on two\\nbenchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD. The experiment results prove that the\\nproposed semi-supervised learning model can effectively utilize unlabeled data\\nand combine multi-modalities to boost the emotion recognition performance,\\nwhich outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches under the same condition.\\nThe proposed model also achieves competitive capacity compared with existing\\napproaches which take advantage of additional auxiliary information such as\\nspeaker and interaction context.\\n",

      "abstract": "Live video interactive commenting, a.k.a. danmaku, is an emerging social feature on online video sites, which involves rich multimodal information interaction among viewers. In order to support various related research, we build a large scale video interactive comments dataset called VideoIC, which consists of 4951 videos spanning 557 hours and 5 million comments. Videos are collected from popular categories on the 'Bilibili' video streaming website. Comparing to other existing danmaku datasets, our VideoIC contains richer and denser comments information, with 1077 comments per video on average. High comment density and diverse video types make VideoIC a challenging corpus for various research such as automatic video comments generation. We also propose a novel model based on multimodal multitask learning for comment generation (MML-CG), which integrates multiple modalities to achieve effective comment generation and temporal relation prediction. A multitask loss function is designed to train both tasks jointly in the end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments on both VideoIC and Livebot datasets. The results prove the effectiveness of our model and reveal some features of danmaku.",

      "abstract": "Most current image captioning systems focus on describing general image content, and lack background knowledge to deeply understand the image, such as exact named entities or concrete events. In this work, we focus on the entity-aware news image captioning task which aims to generate informative captions by leveraging the associated news articles to provide background knowledge about the target image. However, due to the length of news articles, previous works only employ news articles at the coarse article or sentence level, which are not fine-grained enough to refine relevant events and choose named entities accurately. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Information Concentrated Entity-aware news image CAPtioning (ICECAP) model, which progressively concentrates on relevant textual information within the corresponding news article from the sentence level to the word level. Our model first creates coarse concentration on relevant sentences using a cross-modality retrieval model and then generates captions by further concentrating on relevant words within the sentences. Extensive experiments on both BreakingNews and GoodNews datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms other state-of-the-arts. The code of ICECAP is publicly available at https://github.com/HAWLYQ/ICECAP.",

      "abstract": "With the continuous development of society, electrical energy is an important energy source for human life. Therefore, it is of great significance to discuss and study the ways for electric power companies to reduce losses and increase efficiency to promote the development of the power industry, the development of the social economy, and improve the utilization rate of electrical energy. The large amount of data accumulated by electric power companies for a long time provides a data basis for the analysis of corporate loss reduction and efficiency increase. Aiming at the technology of loss reduction and efficiency increase, the power consumption monitoring model and abnormal line loss analysis model in the station area are proposed in this paper based on the data association in the \"perception layer\" and big data analysis in the \"application layer\" of Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things to effectively carry out the research of multidimensional design ideas of loss reduction and efficiency increase.",

      "abstract": "Detecting meaningful events in an untrimmed video is essential for dense video captioning. In this work, we propose a novel and simple model for event sequence generation and explore temporal relationships of the event sequence in the video. The proposed model omits inefficient two-stage proposal generation and directly generates event boundaries conditioned on bi-directional temporal dependency in one pass. Experimental results show that the proposed event sequence generation model can generate more accurate and diverse events within a small number of proposals. For the event captioning, we follow our previous work to employ the intra-event captioning models into our pipeline system. The overall system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the dense-captioning events in video task with 9.894 METEOR score on the challenge testing set.",

Due to the human-centric nature of the HOI task, it is beneficial to make use of human-related knowledge such as human skeletons to infer fine-grained human-object interactions. However, previous works simply embed skeletons via convolutional networks, which fail to capture structured connections in human skeletons and ignore the object influence. In this work, we propose a Skeleton-based Interactive Graph Network (SIGN) to capture fine-grained human-object interactions via encoding interactive graphs between keypoints in human skeletons and object from spatial and appearance aspects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SIGN model, which achieves significant improvement over baselines and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Sequence-level learning objective has been widely used in captioning tasks to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for many models. In this objective, the model is trained by the reward on the quality of its generated captions (sequence-level). In this work, we show the limitation of the current sequence-level learning objective for captioning tasks from both theory and empirical result. In theory, we show that the current objective is equivalent to only optimizing the precision side of the caption set generated by the model and therefore overlooks the recall side. Empirical result shows that the model trained by this objective tends to get lower score on the recall side. We propose to add a sequence-level exploration term to the current objective to boost recall. It guides the model to explore more plausible captions in the training. In this way, the proposed objective takes both the precision and recall sides of generated captions into account. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method on both video and image captioning datasets.",

      "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval between videos and texts has attracted growing attentions due to the rapid emergence of videos on the web. The current dominant approach is to learn a joint embedding space to measure cross-modal similarities. However, simple embeddings are insufficient to represent complicated visual and textual details, such as scenes, objects, actions and their compositions. To improve fine-grained video-text retrieval, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Reasoning (HGR) model, which decomposes video-text matching into global-to-local levels. The model disentangles text into a hierarchical semantic graph including three levels of events, actions, entities, and generates hierarchical textual embeddings via attention-based graph reasoning. Different levels of texts can guide the learning of diverse and hierarchical video representations for cross-modal matching to capture both global and local details. Experimental results on three video-text datasets demonstrate the advantages of our model. Such hierarchical decomposition also enables better generalization across datasets and improves the ability to distinguish fine-grained semantic differences. Code will be released at https: //github.com/cshizhe/hgr_v2t.",

      "abstract": "Humans are able to describe image contents with coarse to fine details as they wish. However, most image captioning models are intention-agnostic which cannot generate diverse descriptions according to different user intentions initiatively. In this work, we propose the Abstract Scene Graph (ASG) structure to represent user intention in fine-grained level and control what and how detailed the generated description should be. The ASG is a directed graph consisting of three types of abstract nodes (object, attribute, relationship) grounded in the image without any concrete semantic labels. Thus it is easy to obtain either manually or automatically. From the ASG, we propose a novel ASG2Caption model, which is able to recognise user intentions and semantics in the graph, and therefore generate desired captions following the graph structure. Our model achieves better controllability conditioning on ASGs than carefully designed baselines on both VisualGenome and MSCOCO datasets. It also significantly improves the caption diversity via automatically sampling diverse ASGs as control signals. Code will be released at https://github.com/cshizhe/asg2cap.",

We propose two novel question-answering tasks to evaluate models' fine-grained action understanding abilities. The first task is \\textbf{Facial Image Ordering}, which aims to understand visual effects of different actions expressed in natural language to the facial object. The second task is \\textbf{Step Ordering}, which aims to measure cross-modal semantic alignments between untrimmed videos and multi-sentence texts. In this paper, we present the challenge guidelines, the dataset used, and performances of baseline models on the two proposed tasks. The baseline codes and models are released at \\url{https://github.com/AIM3-RUC/YouMakeup_Baseline}.",

      "abstract": "A storyboard is a sequence of images to illustrate a story containing multiple sentences, which has been a key process to create different story products. In this paper, we tackle a new multimedia task of automatic storyboard creation to facilitate this process and inspire human artists. Inspired by the fact that our understanding of languages is based on our past experience, we propose a novel inspire-and-create framework with a story-to-image retriever that selects relevant cinematic images for inspiration and a storyboard creator that further refines and renders images to improve the relevancy and visual consistency. The proposed retriever dynamically employs contextual information in the story with hierarchical attentions and applies dense visual-semantic matching to accurately retrieve and ground images. The creator then employs three rendering steps to increase the flexibility of retrieved images, which include erasing irrelevant regions, unifying styles of images and substituting consistent characters. We carry out extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain visual story datasets. The proposed model achieves better quantitative performance than the state-of-the-art baselines for storyboard creation. Qualitative visualizations and user studies further verify that our approach can create high-quality storyboards even for stories in the wild.",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition has faced the challenge of lacking large-scale human labeled dataset for model learning due to the expensive data annotation cost and inevitable label ambiguity. To tackle such challenge, previous works have explored to transfer emotion label from one modality to the other modality assuming that the supervised annotation does exist in one modality or explored semi-supervised learning strategies to take advantage of large amount of unlabeled data with the focus on a single modality. In this work, we address the multimodal emotion recognition problem with the acoustic and visual modalities and propose a multi-modal network structure of the semi-supervised learning approach with an improved generative adversarial network CT-GAN. Extensive experiments conducted on a multi-modal emotion recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and prove that utilizing unlabeled data via GANs and combining multi-modalities both benefit the classification performance. We also carry out some detailed analysis experiments such as influence of unlabeled data quantity on recognition performance and impact of different normalization strategies for semi-supervised learning etc.",

      "abstract": "Generating image descriptions in different languages is essential to satisfy users worldwide. However, it is prohibitively expensive to collect large-scale paired image-caption dataset for every target language which is critical for training descent image captioning models. Previous works tackle the unpaired cross-lingual image captioning problem through a pivot language, which is with the help of paired image-caption data in the pivot language and pivot-to-target machine translation models. However, such language-pivoted approach suffers from inaccuracy brought by the pivot-to-target translation, including disfluency and visual irrelevancy errors. In this paper, we propose to generate cross-lingual image captions with self-supervised rewards in the reinforcement learning framework to alleviate these two types of errors. We employ self-supervision from mono-lingual corpus in the target language to provide fluency reward, and propose a multi-level visual semantic matching model to provide both sentence-level and concept-level visual relevancy rewards. We conduct extensive experiments for unpaired cross-lingual image captioning in both English and Chinese respectively on two widely used image caption corpora. The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Cross-cultural emotion recognition has been a challenging research problem in the affective computing field. In this paper, we present our solutions for the Cross-cultural Emotion Sub-challenge (CES) in Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2019. The aim of this task is to investigate how emotion knowledge of Western European cultures (German and Hungarian) can be transferred to Chinese culture. Previous studies have shown that the cultural difference can bring significant performance impact to emotion recognition across cultures. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation approach to bridge the gap across different cultures for emotion recognition. The highlights of our complete solution for the CES challenge task include: 1) several efficient deep features from multiple modalities and the LSTM network to capture the temporal information. 2) several multimodal interaction strategies to take advantage of the interlocutor's multimodal information. 3) an unsupervised adversarial adaptation approach to bridge the emotion knowledge gap across different cultures. Our solutions achieve the best CCC performance of 0.4, 0.471 and 0.257 for arousal, valence and likability respectively on the challenge testing set of Chinese, which outperforms the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.355, 0.468 and 0.041.",

      "abstract": "A storyboard is a sequence of images to illustrate a story containing multiple sentences, which has been a key process to create different story products. In this paper, we tackle a new multimedia task of automatic storyboard creation to facilitate this process and inspire human artists. Inspired by the fact that our understanding of languages is based on our past experience, we propose a novel inspire-and-create framework with a story-to-image retriever that selects relevant cinematic images for inspiration and a storyboard creator that further refines and renders images to improve the relevancy and visual consistency. The proposed retriever dynamically employs contextual information in the story with hierarchical attentions and applies dense visual-semantic matching to accurately retrieve and ground images. The creator then employs three rendering steps to increase the flexibility of retrieved images, which include erasing irrelevant regions, unifying styles of images and substituting consistent characters. We carry out extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain visual story datasets. The proposed model achieves better quantitative performance than the state-of-the-art baselines for storyboard creation. Qualitative visualizations and user studies further verify that our approach can create high-quality storyboards even for stories in the wild.",

      "abstract": "Visual relations, which describe various types of interactions between two objects in the image, can provide critical information for comprehensive semantic understanding of the image. Multiple cues related to the objects can contribute to visual relation detection, which mainly include appearances, spacial locations and semantic meanings. It is of great importance to represent different cues and combine them effectively for visual relation detection. However, in previous works, the appearance representation is simply realized by global visual representation based on the bounding boxes of objects, which may not capture salient regions of the interaction between two objects, and the different cue representations are equally concatenated without considering their different contributions for different relations. In this work, we propose a multi-level attention visual relation detection model (MLA-VRD), which generates salient appearance representation via a multi-stage appearance attention strategy and adaptively combine different cues with different importance weighting via a multi-cue attention strategy. Extensive experiment results on two widely used visual relation detection datasets, VRD and Visual Genome, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model which significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-arts. Our proposed model also achieves superior performance under the zero-shot learning condition, which is an important ordeal for testing the generalization ability of visual relation detection models.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our solutions to the grand challenge task \"Relation Understanding in Videos\" in ACM Multimedia 2019. The challenge task aims to detect instances of target visual relations in a video, where a visual relation instance is represented by a relation triplet <subject, predicate, object> with the trajectories of the subject and object. It seems that it is similar to the image relation detection task with the input changed from images to videos. However, video relation detection requires a much more complex pipeline which not only needs to detect objects in each frame, but also track them in the temporal direction. In this challenge, we follow the basic pipeline structure which consists of 3 main separate components: an object detector, an object tracker and a relation predictor. Based on our analysis, there exist data unbalance and label missing problems in the VidOR dataset. We exploit two simple but effective methods to alleviate these problems. We also use trajectory Non-Maximum Suppression and a sliding window method to address the redundancy of trajectory proposals. Experimental results on the challenge task demonstrate that by applying these proposed approaches over the state-of-the-art relation prediction model, the video relation detection performance can be improved with the [email protected] and [email protected] reaching 0.3305 and 0.3507 respectively.",

      "abstract": "This notebook paper presents our model in the VATEX video captioning challenge. In order to capture multi-level aspects in the video, we propose to integrate both temporal and spatial attentions for video captioning. The temporal attentive module focuses on global action movements while spatial attentive module enables to describe more fine-grained objects. Considering these two types of attentive modules are complementary, we thus fuse them via a late fusion strategy. The proposed model significantly outperforms baselines and achieves 73.4 CIDEr score on the testing set which ranks the second place at the VATEX video captioning challenge leaderboard 2019.",

      "abstract": "Tea is a kind of favorite commodity all over the world. In the process of tea production, the classification of different kinds of fresh tea leaves is very important. In this paper, based on the Inception-v3 model Keras platform, we used transfer learning technology to conduct experiments on the fresh tea leaves dataset created by ourselves. In combination with the Inception-v3's inherent performance, saving parameters, accelerating computation, and reducing over-fitting, which can bring convenience in practical production applications. Through the experiment, the discrimination accuracy rate of fresh tea leaves can reach more than 95%. After that, through the data augmentation technology, we can make the discrimination accuracy rate of fresh tea leaves reach 98%, which brings good news to industrial production.",

      "abstract": "The neural machine translation model has suffered from the lack of large-scale parallel corpora. In contrast, we humans can learn multi-lingual translations even without parallel texts by referring our languages to the external world. To mimic such human learning behavior, we employ images as pivots to enable zero-resource translation learning. However, a picture tells a thousand words, which makes multi-lingual sentences pivoted by the same image noisy as mutual translations and thus hinders the translation model learning. In this work, we propose a progressive learning approach for image-pivoted zero-resource machine translation. Since words are less diverse when grounded in the image, we first learn word-level translation with image pivots, and then progress to learn the sentence-level translation by utilizing the learned word translation to suppress noises in image-pivoted multi-lingual sentences. Experimental results on two widely used image-pivot translation datasets, IAPR-TC12 and Multi30k, show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Bilingual lexicon induction, translating words from the source language to the target language, is a long-standing natural language processing task. Recent endeavors prove that it is promising to employ images as pivot to learn the lexicon induction without reliance on parallel corpora. However, these vision-based approaches simply associate words with entire images, which are constrained to translate concrete words and require object-centered images. We humans can understand words better when they are within a sentence with context. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to utilize images and their associated captions to address the limitations of previous approaches. We propose a multi-lingual caption model trained with different mono-lingual multimodal data to map words in different languages into joint spaces. Two types of word representation are induced from the multi-lingual caption model: linguistic features and localized visual features. The linguistic feature is learned from the sentence contexts with visual semantic constraints, which is beneficial to learn translation for words that are less visual-relevant. The localized visual feature is attended to the region in the image that correlates to the word, so that it alleviates the image restriction for salient visual representation. The two types of features are complementary for word translation. Experimental results on multiple language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which substantially outperforms previous vision-based approaches without using any parallel sentences or supervision of seed word pairs.",

In this work, we systematically explore different captioning models with various contexts for the dense-captioning events in video task, which aims to generate captions for different events in the untrimmed video. We propose five types of contexts as well as two categories of event captioning models, and evaluate their contributions for event captioning from both accuracy and diversity aspects. The proposed captioning models are plugged into our pipeline system for the dense video captioning challenge. The overall system achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the dense-captioning events in video task with 9.91 METEOR score on the challenge testing set.",

      "abstract": "Classifying Hyperspectral images with few training samples is a challenging problem. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) are promising techniques to address the problems. GAN constructs an adversarial game between a discriminator and a generator. The generator generates samples that are not distinguishable by the discriminator, and the discriminator determines whether or not a sample is composed of real data. In this paper, by introducing multilayer features fusion in GAN and a dynamic neighborhood voting mechanism, a novel algorithm for HSIs classification based on 1-D GAN was proposed. Extracting and fusing multiple layers features in discriminator, and using a little labeled samples, we fine-tuned a new sample 1-D CNN spectral classifier for HSIs. In order to improve the accuracy of the classification, we proposed a dynamic neighborhood voting mechanism to classify the HSIs with spatial features. The obtained results show that the proposed models provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Hyperspectral data contains abundant information in spectral domain, which is very useful for mineral classification and geological body mapping. But, due to the lack of labeled data, it is difficult to get an acceptable result by just using the small number of labeled data. We adopt a semi-supervised method called CNN, which can effectively extract inner features of hyperspectral image to classify hyperspectral data. However, with constraint to the size of receptive field, it can hardly get higher level features. We propose dilated CNN for mineral classification of hyperspectral data. At the same size of kernels, dilated CNN has bigger receptive field. At the meanwhile, it can get higher accuracy of classification. We test our model on hyperspectral data at Tianshan area, where is rich in minerals. From the result, we can find that our method can get a great result on the mineral classification task, which can be used for making geological map.",

      "abstract": "随着在线视频应用的流行，互联网上的视频数量快速增长.面对互联网上海量的视频，人们对视频检索的要求也越来越精细化.如何按照合适的语义概念对视频进行组织和管理，从而帮助用户更高效、更准确地获取所需视频，成为亟待解决的问题.在大量的应用场景下，需要声音和视觉同时出现才能确定某个视频事件.因此，提出具有视听信息的多模态概念的检测工作.首先，以名词-动词二元组的形式定义多模态概念，其中名词表达了视觉信息，动词表达了听觉信息，且名词和动词具有语义相关性，共同表达语义概念所描述的事件.其次，利用卷积神经网络，以多模态概念的视听相关性为目标训练多模态联合网络，进行端到端的多模态概念检测.实验表明：在多模态概念检测任务上，通过视听相关的联合网络的性能超过了单独的视觉网络和听觉网络.同时，联合网络能够学习到精细化的特征表示，利用该网络提取的视觉特征，在Huawei视频数据集某些特定的类别上超过ImageNet预训练的神经网络特征；联合网络提取的音频特征，在ESC50数据集上，也超过在Youtube8m上训练的神经网络音频特征约5.7%.",

Previous works mainly rely on multi-cultural datasets to address the cross-culture discrepancy, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning framework to alleviate the culture influence on multimodal emotion recognition. We treat the emotion recognition and culture recognition as two adversarial tasks. The emotion feature embedding is trained to improve the emotion recognition but to confuse the culture recognition, so that it is more emotion-salient and culture-invariant for cross-culture emotion recognition. Our approach is applicable to both mono-culture and multi-culture emotion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous baselines in both cross-culture and multi-culture evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Automatic video description generation (a.k.a video captioning) is one of the ultimate goals for video understanding. Despite the wide range of applications such as video indexing and retrieval etc., the video captioning task remains quite challenging due to the complexity and diversity of video content. First, open-domain videos cover a broad range of topics, which results in highly variable vocabularies and expression styles to describe the video contents. Second, videos naturally contain multiple modalities including image, motion, and acoustic media. The information provided by different modalities differs in different conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel topic-guided video captioning model to address the above-mentioned challenges in video captioning. Our model consists of two joint tasks, namely, latent topic generation and topic-guided caption generation. The topic generation task aims to automatically predict the latent topic of the video. Since there is no groundtruth topic information, we mine multimodal topics in an unsupervised fashion based on video contents and annotated captions, and then distill the topic distribution to a topic prediction model. In the topic-guided generation task, we employ the topic guidance for two purposes. The first is to narrow down the language complexity across topics, where we propose the topic-aware decoder to leverage the latent topics to induce topic-related language models. The decoder is also generic and can be integrated with a temporal attention mechanism. The second is to dynamically attend to important modalities by topics, where we propose a flexible topic-guided multimodal ensemble framework and use the topic gating network to determine the attention weights. The two tasks are correlated with each other, and they collaborate to generate more detailed and accurate video captions. Our extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets MSR-VTT and Youtube2Text demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topic-guided video captioning system, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.",

      "abstract": "Predicting the interestingness of videos can greatly improve people's satisfactions in many applications such as video retrieval and recommendations. In order to obtain less subjective interestingness annotations, partial pairwise comparisons among videos are firstly annotated and all videos are then ranked globally to generate the interestingness value. We study two factors in interestingness prediction, namely comparison information and evaluation metric optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel deep ranking model which simulates the human annotation procedures for more reliable interestingness prediction. To be specific, we extract different visual and acoustic features and sample different comparison video pairs by different strategies such as random and fixed-distance. The richer information of human pairwise ranking annotations are used as a richer guidance compared with the plain interestingness value to train our networks. In addition to comparison information, we also explore reinforcement ranking model which directly optimizes the evaluation metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion of the two ranking models can make better use of human labels and outperform the regression baseline. Also, it reaches the best performance according to the results of MediaEval 2017 interestingness prediction task.",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition is a challenging task which can make great impact on improving natural human computer interactions. In this paper, we present our solutions for the Cross-cultural Emotion Sub-challenge (CES) of Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2018. The videos were recorded in dyadic human-human interaction scenarios. In these complicated scenarios, a person's emotion state will be influenced by the interlocutor's behaviors, such as talking style/prosody, speech content, facial expression and body language. In this paper, we highlight two aspects of our solutions: 1) we explore multiple modalities's efficient deep learning features and use the LSTM network to capture the long-term temporal information. 2) we propose several multimodal interaction strategies to imitate the real interaction patterns for exploring which modality information of the interlocutor is effective, and we find the best interaction strategy which can make full use of the interlocutor's information. Our solutions achieve the best CCC performance of 0.704 and 0.783 on arousal and valence respectively on the challenge testing set of German, which significantly outperform the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.524 and 0.577 on arousal and valence, and which outperform the winner of the AVEC2017 with corresponding CCC of 0.675 and 0.756 on arousal and valence. The experimental results show that our proposed interaction strategies have strong generalization ability and can bring more robust performance.",

      "abstract": "Most methods for singular points detection usually depend on the orientation fields of fingerprints, which cannot achieve reliable and accurate detection of poor quality fingerprints. In this study, a new method for fingerprint singular points detection based on Faster-RCNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Network method) is proposed, which is a two-step process, and an orientation constraint is added in Faster-RCNN to obtain orientation information of singular points. Besides, we designed a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for singular points detection according to the characteristics of fingerprint images and the existing works. Specifically, the proposed method could extract singular points directly from raw fingerprint images without traditional preprocessing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In comparison with other detection algorithms, our method achieves 96.03% detection rate for core points and 98.33% detection rate for delta points on FVC2002 DB1 dataset while 90.75% for core points and 94.87% on NIST SD4 dataset, which outperform other algorithms.",

Because semi-supervised approaches can utilize information contained in the unlabeled samples and labeled samples, it is a suitable choice. A novel semi-supervised spectral-spatial classification method for hyperspectral data based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed in this paper. First, we use a custom one-dimensional GAN to train the hyperspectral data to obtain spectral features. After using a new small convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the spectral features, we use a new classification method based on a majority voting strategy further to improve the classification result. The performance of our method is evaluated on ROSIS image data, and the results show that the proposed method can acquire satisfactory results when compared with traditional methods using a few of labeled samples.",

Temporal proposal generation and caption generation are both important to the dense captioning task. Therefore, we propose a proposal ranking model to employ a set of effective feature representations for proposal generation, and ensemble a series of caption models enhanced with context information to generate captions robustly on predicted proposals. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the dense video captioning task with 8.529 METEOR score on the challenge testing set.",

      "abstract": "Audio event recognition (AER) has been an important research problem with a wide range of applications. However, it is very challenging to develop large scale audio event recognition models. On the one hand, usually there are only \"weak\" labeled audio training data available, which only contains labels of audio events without temporal boundaries. On the other hand, the distribution of audio events is generally long-tailed, with only a few positive samples for large amounts of audio events. These two issues make it hard to learn discriminative acoustic features to recognize audio events especially for long-tailed events. In this paper, we propose a novel class-aware self-attention mechanism with attention factor sharing to generate discriminative clip-level features for audio event recognition. Since a target audio event only occurs in part of an entire audio clip and its corresponding temporal interval varies, the proposed class-aware self-attention approach learns to highlight relevant temporal intervals and to suppress irrelevant noises at the same time. In order to learn attention patterns effectively for those long-tailed events, we combine both the domain knowledge and data driven strategies to share attention factors in the proposed attention mechanism, which transfers the common knowledge learned from other similar events to the rare events. The proposed attention mechanism is a pluggable component and can be trained end-to-end in the overall AER model. We evaluate our model on a large-scale audio event corpus \"Audio Set\" with both short-term and long-term acoustic features. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which improves the overall audio event recognition performance with different acoustic features especially for events with low resources. Moreover, the experiments also show that our proposed model is able to learn new audio events with a few training examples effectively and efficiently without disturbing the previously learned audio events.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our solutions for the 2017 Multimodal Emotion Recognition Challenge (MEC 2017). This challenge task aims to recognize the emotional state for short video segments extracted from Chinese films, TV plays and talk shows. There are eight target emotional states: angry, anxious, disgust, surprise, worried, sad, happy and neutral. We extract various features from multiple modalities including audio, text, facial expression and visual context. Both traditional hand-crafted features and learned deep features are explored from different modalities. We also apply temporal models to capture the temporal information in facial expression. Our proposed methods for visual and multimodal sub-challenges outperform the MEC2017 official baseline system by 19.06% and 8.93% on MAP respectively on the test set, which shows the effectiveness of our solutions.",

However, owing to the lack of sufficient minutiae points, the conventional method do not perform well in the above situation. We propose a new fingerprint matching technique which utilizes ridges as features to deal with partial fingerprint images and combines the modified generalized Hough transform and scoring strategy based on machine learning. The algorithm can effectively meet the real-time and space-saving requirements of the resource constrained devices.

      "abstract": "In this paper, the Common Cause Failures (CCFs) we consider are caused by random loads and strength. Unlike the general reliability model for CCF systems, failure modes are regarded as the basic units instead of components. Firstly, the reliability models of typical series systems and parallel systems are developed based on failure mechanism analysis, GLSI model and conditional probability theory. Secondly, the reliability model of a specific series-parallel system subject to two kinds of Common Causes (CCs) is developed based on reliability block diagram. Furthermore, the general modeling procedures of CCF systems subject to two kinds of CCs are presented. Finally, by using Monte-Carlo simulation, a group of data is given to verify the CCF model of the given series-parallel system and the CCF model is compared with the independent-failure model. It can be concluded that the CCF modeling method proposed in this paper is applicable for incomplete CCF systems subject to two-kind common causes.",

The task aims to predict one of the seven basic emotions for short video segments. We extract different features from audio and facial expression modalities. We also explore the temporal LSTM model with the input of frame facial features, which improves the performance of the non-temporal model. The fusion of different modality features and the temporal model lead us to achieve a 58.5% accuracy on the testing set, which shows the effectiveness of our methods.",

      "abstract": "The topic diversity of open-domain videos leads to various vocabularies and linguistic expressions in describing video contents, and therefore, makes the video captioning task even more challenging. In this paper, we propose an unified caption framework, M&M TGM, which mines multimodal topics in unsupervised fashion from data and guides the caption decoder with these topics. Compared to pre-defined topics, the mined multimodal topics are more semantically and visually coherent and can reflect the topic distribution of videos better. We formulate the topic-aware caption generation as a multi-task learning problem, in which we add a parallel task, topic prediction, in addition to the caption task. For the topic prediction task, we use the mined topics as the teacher to train a student topic prediction model, which learns to predict the latent topics from multimodal contents of videos. The topic prediction provides intermediate supervision to the learning process. As for the caption task, we propose a novel topic-aware decoder to generate more accurate and detailed video descriptions with the guidance from latent topics. The entire learning procedure is end-to-end and it optimizes both tasks simultaneously. The results from extensive experiments conducted on the MSR-VTT and Youtube2Text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. M&M TGM not only outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics and on both benchmark datasets, but also achieves better generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Automatic emotion recognition is a challenging task which can make great impact on improving natural human computer interactions. In this paper, we present our effort for the Affect Subtask in the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2017, which requires participants to perform continuous emotion prediction on three affective dimensions: Arousal, Valence and Likability based on the audiovisual signals. We highlight three aspects of our solutions: 1) we explore and fuse different hand-crafted and deep learned features from all available modalities including acoustic, visual, and textual modalities, and we further consider the interlocutor influence for the acoustic features; 2) we compare the effectiveness of non-temporal model SVR and temporal model LSTM-RNN and show that the LSTM-RNN can not only alleviate the feature engineering efforts such as construction of contextual features and feature delay, but also improve the recognition performance significantly; 3) we apply multi-task learning strategy for collaborative prediction of multiple emotion dimensions with shared representations according to the fact that different emotion dimensions are correlated with each other. Our solutions achieve the CCC of 0.675, 0.756 and 0.509 on arousal, valence, and likability respectively on the challenge testing set, which outperforms the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.375, 0.466, and 0.246 on arousal, valence, and likability.",

      "abstract": "Generating natural language descriptions for videos (a.k.a video captioning) has attracted much research attention in recent years, and a lot of models have been proposed to improve the caption performance. However, due to the rapid progress in dataset expansion and feature representation, newly proposed caption models have been evaluated on different settings, which makes it unclear about the contributions from either features or models. Therefore, in this work we aim to gain a deep understanding about \"where are we\" for the current development of video captioning. First, we carry out extensive experiments to identify the contribution from different components in video captioning task and make fair comparison among several state-of-the-art video caption models. Second, we discover that these state-of-the-art models are complementary so that we could benefit from \"wisdom of the crowd\" through ensembling and reranking. Finally, we give a preliminary answer to the question \"how far are we from the human-level performance in general'' via a series of carefully designed experiments. In summary, our caption models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the MSR-VTT 2017 challenge, and it is comparable with the average human-level performance on current caption metrics. However, our analysis also shows that we still have a long way to go, such as further improving the generalization ability of current caption models.",

      "abstract": "Generating video descriptions in natural language (a.k.a. video captioning) is a more challenging task than image captioning as the videos are intrinsically more complicated than images in two aspects. First, videos cover a broader range of topics, such as news, music, sports and so on. Second, multiple topics could coexist in the same video. In this paper, we propose a novel caption model, topic-guided model (TGM), to generate topic-oriented descriptions for videos in the wild via exploiting topic information. In addition to predefined topics, i.e., category tags crawled from the web, we also mine topics in a data-driven way based on training captions by an unsupervised topic mining model. We show that data-driven topics reflect a better topic schema than the predefined topics. As for testing video topic prediction, we treat the topic mining model as teacher to train the student, the topic prediction model, by utilizing the full multi-modalities in the video especially the speech modality. We propose a series of caption models to exploit topic guidance, including implicitly using the topics as input features to generate words related to the topic and explicitly modifying the weights in the decoder with topics to function as an ensemble of topic-aware language decoders. Our comprehensive experimental results on the current largest video caption dataset MSR-VTT prove the effectiveness of our topic-guided model, which significantly surpasses the winning performance in the 2016 MSR video to language challenge.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our methods for the facial AU occurrence subtask in the FG 2017 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2017). The task is to detect 10 AUs that occur frequently in the BP4D database. In our approach, we utilized the hand-crafted features (LBPTOP) and learned features (CNN features) which encode the temporal dynamics and static facial appearance respectively. Multiple classifiers including SVM and Random Forest are used to recognize the AU occurrence. Among all different features, the learned CNN features are the most discriminative feature for the task. And the combinations of the multiple features are beneficial. To capture the relationships among AUs, we also apply multi-AUs late fusion, which further boost the performance. Our system achieves an average macro F1 of 49.8% and an average accuracy of 69.4% in the testing set which outperforms the baseline (macro F1 45.2% and average accuracy 56.1%).",

      "abstract": "Dermoscopy image is usually used in early diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The diagnosis accuracy by visual inspection is highly relied on the dermatologist's clinical experience. Due to the inaccuracy, subjectivity, and poor reproducibility of human judgement, an automatic recognition algorithm of dermoscopy image is highly desired. In this work, we present a hybrid classification framework for dermoscopy image assessment by combining deep convolutional neural network (CNN), Fisher vector (FV) and support vector machine (SVM). Specifically, the deep representations of subimages at various locations of a rescaled dermoscopy image are first extracted via a natural image dataset pre-trained on CNN. Then we adopt an orderless visual statistics based FV encoding methods to aggregate these features to build more invariant representations. Finally, the FV encoded representations are classified for diagnosis using a linear SVM. Compared with traditional low-level visual features based recognition approaches, our scheme is simpler and requires no complex preprocessing. Furthermore, the orderless representations are less sensitive to geometric deformation. We evaluate our proposed method on the ISBI 2016 Skin lesion challenge dataset and promising results are obtained. Also, we achieve consistent improvement in accuracy even without fine-tuning the CNN.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present our methods to the Audio-Video Based Emotion Recognition subtask in the 2016 Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) Challenge. The task is to predict one of the seven basic emotions for the characters in the video clips extracted from movies or TV shows. In our approach, we explore various multimodal features from audio, facial image and video motion modalities. The audio features contain statistical acoustic features, MFCC Bag-of-Audio-Words and MFCC Fisher Vectors. For image related features, we extract hand-crafted features (LBP-TOP and SPM Dense SIFT) and learned features (CNN features). The improved Dense Trajectory is used as the motion related features. We train SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers for each kind of feature. Among them, MFCC fisher vector is the best acoustic features and the facial CNN feature is the most discriminative feature for emotion recognition. We utilize late fusion to combine different modality features and achieve a 50.76% accuracy on the testing set, which significantly outperforms the baseline test accuracy of 40.47%.",

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for product recommendation encounter a significant performance drop in categories where a user has no purchase history. This problem needs to be addressed since current online retailers are moving beyond single category and attempting to be diversified. In this article, we investigate the challenging problem of product recommendation in unexplored categories and discover that the price, a factor comparable across categories, can improve the recommendation performance significantly. We introduce the price utility concept to characterize users’ sense of price and propose three different utility functions. We show that user price preference in a category is a distribution and we mine typical user price preference patterns based on three different types of distance between distributions. We fuse user price preference through regularization and joint factorization to boost recommendation performance in both browsing and buying shopping orientations. Experimental results show that fusing user price preference improves performance in a series of recommendation tasks: unexplored category recommendation, product recommendation under a given unexplored category, and product recommendation under generic unexplored categories.",

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion strategy named conditional attention fusion, which can dynamically pay attention to different modalities at each time step. Long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) is applied as the basic uni-modality model to capture long time dependencies. The weights assigned to different modalities are automatically decided by the current input features and recent history information rather than being fixed at any kinds of situation. Our experimental results on a benchmark dataset AVEC2015 show the effectiveness of our method which outperforms several common fusion strategies for valence prediction.",

      "abstract": "This paper attacks the challenging problem of violence detection in videos. Different from existing works focusing on combining multi-modal features, we go one step further by adding and exploiting subclasses visually related to violence. We enrich the MediaEval 2015 violence dataset by manually labeling violence videos with respect to the subclasses. Such fine-grained annotations not only help understand what have impeded previous efforts on learning to fuse the multi-modal features, but also enhance the generalization ability of the learned fusion to novel test data. The new subclass based solution, with AP of 0.303 and P100 of 0.55 on the MediaEval 2015 test set, outperforms the state-of-the-art. Notice that our solution does not require fine-grained annotations on the test set, so it can be directly applied on novel and fully unlabeled videos. Interestingly, our study shows that motion related features (MBH, HOG and HOF), though being essential part in previous systems, are seemingly dispensable.

MSR Video to Language Challenge provides a good chance to study multi-modality fusion in caption task. In this paper, we propose the multi-modal fusion encoder and integrate it with text sequence decoder into an end-to-end video caption framework. Features from visual, aural, speech and meta modalities are fused together to represent the video contents. Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNNs) are then used as the decoder to generate natural language sentences. Experimental results show the effectiveness of multi-modal fusion encoder trained in the end-to-end framework, which achieved top performance in both common metrics evaluation and human evaluation.",

However, a simple profile with groups of related images lacks explicit semantic information, such as which images correspond to which aspects of the event. In this paper, we propose to add explicit semantic information to image profiling by linking images in the profile with related phrases in the event description. We measure the relevance of an image-phrase pair via a real-valued matching score. We exploit instance-wise ranking loss function to learn the matching score and we deal with two challenges: 1) how to automatically generate labeled positive data: we leverage out-of-domain labeled datasets to generate pseudo positive in-domain labels and propose a new algorithm (WIL4PPL) to robustly learn the model from the noisy pseudo positive labels; 2) how to automatically generate negative data: we propose a negative set generation algorithm to guide the model in learning which phrases and images to distinguish. We compare our model to three baselines and conduct detailed analysis and case studies to verify the quality of learnt semantic information. The extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms which significantly outperform the baselines.",

Different from existing historic events related works, we focus on the retrieval of historic events by semantic related multimedia knowledge. Our system can not only search historic events based on keyword queries, but also retrieve similar historic events to a given event based on chosen facets. In both cases, the system returns top retrieval results and shows the image profiles of each historic event. To build such functions, we automatically mine knowledge from multimedia data and index each historic event. Our online demo is available at http://222.29.193.164/HistoryRhyme.",

Video description generation is a more complex task than image caption. Most works of video description generation focus on visual information in the video. However, audio provides rich information for describing video contents as well. In this paper, we propose to generate video descriptions in natural sentences using both audio and visual cues. We use unified deep neural networks with both convolutional and recurrent structure. Experimental results on the Microsoft Research Video Description (MSVD) corpus prove that fusing audio information greatly improves the video description performance.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition has been an active research area with both wide applications and big challenges. This paper presents our effort for the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC2015), whose goal is to explore utilizing audio, visual and physiological signals to continuously predict the value of the emotion dimensions (arousal and valence). Our system applies the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to model temporal information. We explore various aspects to improve the prediction performance including: the dominant modalities for arousal and valence prediction, duration of features, novel loss functions, directions of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), multi-task learning, different structures for early feature fusion and late fusion. Best settings are chosen according to the performance on the development set. Competitive experimental results compared with the baseline show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

      "abstract": "History event related knowledge is precious and imagery is a powerful medium that records diverse information about the event. In this paper, we propose to automatically construct an image profile given a one sentence description of the historic event which contains where, when, who and what elements. Such a simple input requirement makes our solution easy to scale up and support a wide range of culture preservation and curation related applications ranging from wikipedia enrichment to history education. However, history relevant information on the web is available as \"wild and dirty\" data, which is quite different from clean, manually curated and structured information sources. There are two major challenges to build our proposed image profiles: 1) unconstrained image genre diversity. We categorize images into genres of documents/maps, paintings or photos. Image genre classification involves a full-spectrum of features from low-level color to high-level semantic concepts. 2) image content diversity. It can include faces, objects and scenes. Furthermore, even within the same event, the views and subjects of images are diverse and correspond to different facets of the event. To solve this challenge, we group images at two levels of granularity: iconic image grouping and facet image grouping. These require different types of features and analysis from near exact matching to soft semantic similarity. We develop a full-range feature analysis module which is composed of several levels, each suitable for different types of image analysis tasks. The wide range of features are based on both classical hand-crafted features and different layers of a convolutional neural network. We compare and study the performance of the different levels in the full-range features and show their effectiveness on handling such a wild, unconstrained dataset.",

In this paper, we therefore study how to utilize annotated data from other domains (source domain) to improve emotion classification on microblog texts (target domain). Transfer learning has been a successful approach for cross domain learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, little attention has been paid for automatically selecting the appropriate samples from the source domain before applying transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an effective framework to sampling available data in the source domain before transfer learning, which we name as Two-Stage Sampling. The improvement of emotion classification on Chinese microblog texts demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "While we have made significant progress over image understanding and search, how to meet the ultimate goal of satisfying both exploration and exploitation in one single system is still an open challenge. In the context of landmark images, it means that a system should not only be able to help users to quickly locate the photo they are interested in (exploitation), but also to discover different parts of the landmark which have never been seen before (exploration), which is a common request as evidenced by many recent multimedia studies. To the best of our knowledge, existing systems mainly focus on either exploration (e.g., photo browsing) or exploitation (e.g., representative photo identification), while users' need of exploration and exploitation is dynamically mixed. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by organizing landmark images into a hierarchical summary which gives user the flexibility of conducting both exploration and exploitation. In the hierarchical summary construction, we introduce two principles: the coherence principle and the diversity principle. Behind these two principles, the intrinsic concept is “detail-level,” which measures how much detail that an image reflects for a certain landmark. A new objective function is derived from the definition of both exploration and exploitation experience on detail-level. The problem of finding an optimal hierarchical summary is formulated as searching over a space of trees for the one that achieves the best objective score. Extensive quantitative experimental results and comprehensive user studies show that the optimized hierarchical summary is able to satisfy both experiences simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing use of audio sensors in user generated content (UGC) collections, semantic concept annotation from video soundtracks has become an important research problem. In this paper, we investigate reducing the semantic gap of the traditional data-driven bag-of-audio-words based audio annotation approach by utilizing the large-amount of wild audio data and their rich user tags, from which we propose a new feature representation based on semantic class model distance. We conduct experiments on the data collection from HUAWEI Accurate and Fast Mobile Video Annotation Grand Challenge 2014. We also fuse the audio-only annotation system with a visual-only system. The experimental results show that our audio-only concept annotation system can detect semantic concepts significantly better than does random guessing. The new feature representation achieves comparable annotation performance with the bag-of-audio-words feature. In addition, it can provide more semantic interpretation in the output. The experimental results also prove that the audio-only system can provide significant complementary information to the visual-only concept annotation system for performance boost and for better interpretation of semantic concepts both visually and acoustically.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we explore one of the key aspects in building an emotion recognition system: generating suitable feature representations. We generate feature representations from both acoustic and lexical levels. At the acoustic level, we first extract low-level features such as intensity, F0, jitter, shimmer and spectral contours etc. We then generate different acoustic feature representations based on these low-level features, including statistics over these features, a new representation derived from a set of low-level acoustic codewords, and a new representation from Gaussian Supervectors. At the lexical level, we propose a new feature representation named emotion vector (eVector). We also use the traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) feature. We apply these feature representations for emotion recognition and compare their performance on the USC-IEMOCAP database. We also combine these different feature representations via early fusion and late fusion. Our experimental results show that late fusion of both acoustic and lexical features achieves four-class emotion recognition accuracy of 69.2%.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing use of audio sensors in user generated content collection, how to detect semantic concepts using audio streams has become an important research problem. In this paper, we present a semantic concept annotation system using soundtracks/ audio of the video. We investigate three different acoustic feature representations for audio semantic concept annotation and explore fusion of audio annotation with visual annotation systems. We test our system on the data collection from HUAWEI Accurate and Fast Mobile Video Annotation Grand Challenge 2014. The experimental results show that our audio-only concept annotation system can detect semantic concepts significantly better than random guess. It can also provide significant complementary information to the visual-based concept annotation system for performance boost. Further detailed analysis shows that for interpreting a semantic concept both visually and acoustically, it is better to train concept models for the visual system and audio system using visual-driven and audio-driven ground truth separately.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we summarize our experiments in the Image- CLEF 2015 Scalable Concept Image Annotation challenge. The RUC- Tencent team participated in all subtasks: concept detection and local- ization, and image sentence generation. For concept detection, we ex- periments with automated approaches to gather high-quality training examples from the Web, in particular, visual disambiguation by Hierar- chical Semantic Embedding. Per concept, an ensemble of linear SVMs is trained by Negative Bootstrap, with CNN features as image represen- tation. Concept localization is achieved by classifying object proposals generated by Selective Search. For the sentence generation task, we adopt Google's LSTM-RNN model, train it on the MSCOCO dataset, and ne- tune it on the ImageCLEF 2015 development dataset. We further develop a sentence re-ranking strategy based on the concept detection informa- tion from the rst task. Overall, our system is ranked the 3rd for concept detection and localization, and is the best for image sentence generation in both clean and noisy tracks.",

We build violent scene detectors using both audio and visual cues. In particular, the audio cue is represented by bag-of-audio-words with sher vector encoding. The visual cue is exploited by extracting CNN features from video frames. The detectors are implemented using two-class linear SVM classiers. Evaluation shows that the audio detectors and the visual detectors are comparable and complementary to each other. Among our submissions, multi-modal late fusion leads to the best performance.",

It will lead to considerable errors or even misleading conclusion by neglecting failure dependence and assuming independent failure when estimating the structural reliability. In this paper, the reliability models of CCF structures caused by the randomness of load are developed and the estimation methods in consideration of both physical uncertainty and statistical uncertainty are proposed. Firstly, according to the LSI model and conditional probability method, reliability models of CCF component, CCF series system, CCF parallel system and CCF k/n system are derived. Secondly, the reliability point estimates of CCF structures are presented according to the maximum likelihood estimation of unknown parameters. Finally, in consideration of the statistical uncertainty of load and strength, a Monte-Carlo method is presented. The reliability samples of units from their reliability confidence distribution and reliability estimation function of CCF system are combined in the method to simulate CCF structural operation and obtain the interval estimate of structural reliability. This method has little limitation to the size and complexity of systems.",

For each category, we then describe the current hot topics, existing technologies, and potential research focuses in the future.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging research area with wide applications. In this paper we explore one of the key aspects of building an emotion recognition system: generating suitable feature representation. We extract features from four angles: (1) low-level acoustic features such as intensity, F0, jitter, shimmer and spectral contours etc. and statistical functions over these features, (2) a set of features derived from segmental cepstral-based features scored against emotion-dependent Gaussian mixture models, (3) a set of features derived from a set of low-level acoustic codewords and (4) GMM supervectors constructed by stacking the means or covariance or weights of the adapted mixture components on each utterance. We apply these features for emotion recognition independently and jointly and compare their performance within this task. We build a support vector machine (SVM) classifier based on these features on the IEMOCAP database. The four-class emotion recognition accuracy of 71.9% of our system outperforms the previously reported best results on this dataset.",

      "abstract": "For most complex systems, CCF (Common Cause Failures) are their common features. It will lead to considerable errors or even misleading conclusion by neglecting failure dependence and assuming independence when evaluating the system reliability. Most of the existing CCF models focused on systems under single common cause. For systems under multiple common causes, these models are not applicable. In this paper, a new implicit modeling method is proposed to address the effect of CCFs in the reliability evaluation of static parallel systems based on failure mechanism analysis, GLSI model, conditional probability and Boolean truth table/Minimal path sets. This method enables the evaluation of multiple common causes that affect components simultaneous. An illustrative example is given in the end. The calculation result based on the proposed CCF model is lower than that of independent model, and the CCF model is verified to be more applicable by using Monte-Carlo simulation.",

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for product recommendation encounter significant performance drop in categories where a user has no purchase history. This problem needs to be addressed since current online retailers are moving beyond single category and attempting to be diversified. In this paper, we investigate the challenge problem of product recommendation in unexplored categories and discover that the price, a factor transferrable across categories, can improve the recommendation performance significantly. Through our investigation, we address four research questions progressively: 1) what is the impact of unexplored category on recommendation performance? 2) How to represent the price factor from the recommendation point of view? 3) What does price factor across categories mean to recommendation? 4) How to utilize price factor across categories for recommendation in unexplored categories? Based on a series of experiments and analysis conducted on a dataset collected from a leading E-commerce website, we discover valuable findings for the above four questions: first, unexplored categories cause performance drop by 40% relatively for current recommendation systems; second, the price factor can be represented as either a quantity for a product or a distribution for a user to improve performance; third, consumer behavior with respect to price factor across categories is complicated and needs to be carefully modeled; finally and most importantly, we propose a new method which encodes the two perspectives of the price factor. The proposed method significantly improves the recommendation performance in unexplored categories over the state-of-the-art baseline systems and shortens the performance gap by 43% relatively.",

Our system automatically recognizes the landmark, shows historical events chronologically and provides detailed photos for the events. To build these functions, we fuse information from multiple online resources.",

Per concept we learn an ensemble of fast intersection kernel SVMs from three sources of training data, all obtained with manual annotation for free. The focus of our experiments this year is to answer the question of how many tags we should use to annotate a novel image. To that end, we introduce adaptive tag selection. In contrast to the common top-k strategy which selects a fixed number of top ranked tags to annotate an unlabeled image, our method estimates the value of k with respect to the image. Given the same concept rank- ings, the top-5 strategy obtains MF-sample of 0.206, while adaptive tag selection reaches MF-sample of 0.311.",

Typical systems focus heavily on the use of visual data. Audio data, however, also contains rich information that can be effectively used for video retrieval, and MED could benefit from the attention of researchers in audio analysis. We present several systems for performing MED using only audio data, report the results of each system on the TRECVID MED 2011 development dataset, and compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.",

A general labeling system for identifying audio patterns could unite research efforts in the field. This paper introduces 42 distinct labels, the “noisemes”, developed for the manual annotation of noise segments as they occur in audio streams of consumer captured and semiprofessionally produced videos. The labels describe distinct noise units based on audio concepts, independent of visual concepts as much as possible. We trained a recognition system using 5.6 hours of manually labeled data, and present recognition results",

The novelty of the filterbank lies in its averaging of energy at frequencies related by harmonicity rather than by adjacency. Improvements are presented which achieve a 37%rel reduction in error rate under these conditions. The improved features are combined with a similar Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) system to yield error rate reductions of 32%rel, suggesting that HSCCs offer information which is complimentary to that available to today's MFCC-based systems.",

      "abstract": "The Informedia group participated in three tasks this year, including: Multimedia Event Detection (MED), Semantic Indexing (SIN) and Surveillance Event Detection. Generally, all of these tasks consist of three main steps: extracting feature, training detector and fusing. In the feature extraction part, we extracted a lot of low-level features, high-level features and text features. Especially, we used the Spatial-Pyramid Matching technique to represent the low-level visual local features, such as SIFT and MoSIFT, which describe the location information of feature points. In the detector training part, besides the traditional SVM, we proposed a Sequential Boosting SVM classifier to deal with the large-scale unbalance classification problem. In the fusion part, to take the advantages from different features, we tried three different fusion methods: early fusion, late fusion and double fusion. Double fusion is a combination of early fusion and late fusion. The experimental results demonstrated that double fusion is consistently better, or at least comparable than early fusion and late fusion.",

In this work we present several findings on far-field speech from the MIXER5 Corpus, in the areas of feature extraction, speaker modeling, and multichannel score combination. First, we observe that minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) features outperform Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features, and that fundamental frequency variation (FFV) features offer complimentary information to both MFCC and MVDR features. Second, we present evidence that factor analysis significantly improves system performance, compared to the more traditional GMM/UBM strategy. Third, we find that frame-based score competition significantly improves performance under mismatched conditions with multiple channels available.",

      "abstract": "For TV and radio shows containing narrowband speech, Speech-to-text (STT) accuracy on the narrowband audio can be improved by using an acoustic model trained on acoustically matched data. To selectively apply it, one must first be able to accurately detect which audio segments are narrowband. The present paper explores two different bandwidth classification approaches: a traditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approach and a spline-based classifier that categorizes audio segments based on their power spectra. We focus on shows found in the DARPA GALE Mandarin training and test sets, where the ratio of wideband to narrowband shows is very large. In this setting, the spline-based classifier reduces the number of misclassified wideband segments by up to 95% relative to the GMM-based classifier for the same number of misclassified narrowband segments.",

Therefore, we investigated in this paper how speaker identification systems perform on voice transformed speech. We conducted experiments with two different approaches, the classical GMM-based speaker identification system and the Phonetic speaker identification system. Our experimental results showed that current standard voice transformation techniques are able to fool the GMM-based system but not the Phonetic speaker identification system. These findings imply that future speaker identification systems should include idiosyncratic knowledge in order to successfully distinguish transformed speech from natural speech and thus be armed against imposter attacks.",

The study compares performances between normal and whispered speech mode in clean and noisy environment under matched and mismatched training conditions, and describes the impact of feature warping and throat microphone on noise reduction. Score combination strategies are used when only little whisper data is available to improve performance. In sum, we achieved 8% to 33% relative improvements in identification accuracy with only 5 to 10 seconds noisy whispered speech data per speaker.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of multimodal fusion for person identification in a smart environment. The multi-modal system consists of a video-based face recognition system and a speaker identification system. We investigated different score normalization, modality weighting and modality combination schemes during the fusion of the individual modalities. We introduced two new modality weighting schemes, namely, the cumulative ratio of correct matches (CRCM) and distance-to-second-closest (DT2ND) measures. In addition, we also assessed the effects of the well-known score normalization and classifier combination methods on the identification performance. Experimental results obtained on the CLEAR 2007 evaluation corpus, which contains audio-visual recordings from different smart rooms, show that CRCM-based modality weighting improves the correct identification rates significantly.",

By applying reverberation compensation and feature warping we achieved significant improvements under mismatched training-testing conditions. To capture useful information from multiple distant microphones, two approaches for multiple channel combination are investigated. This leads to 84.1% and 78.1% relative improvements on the Distant Microphone database. Furthermore, we tested the resulting system on the ICSI Meeting Corpus. The improvements are also very high on this task, which indicates that our system is robust to changing conditions in a remote microphone setting.",

Two systems were developed and evaluated in the NIST RT-04S Meeting Recognition Evaluation, the Multiple Distant Microphone (MDM) system and the Individual Headset Microphone (IHM) system. The MDM system achieved a speaker diarization performance of 28.17%. This system also aims to provide automatic speech segments and speaker grouping information for speech recognition, a necessary prerequisite for subsequent audio processing. A 44.5% word error rate was achieved for speech recognition. The IHM system is based on the short-time crosscorrelation of all personal channel pairs. It requires no prior training and executes in one fifth real time on modern architectures. A 35.7% word error rate was achieved for speech recognition when segmentation was provided by this system.",

      "abstract": "We propose an algorithm for segmenting multispeaker meeting audio, recorded with personal channel microphones, into speech and non-speech intervals for each microphone’s wearer. An algorithm of this type turns out to be necessary prior to subsequent audio processing because, in spite of close-talking microphones, the channels exhibit a high degree of crosstalk due to unbalanced calibration and small inter-speaker distance. The proposed algorithm is based on the short-time crosscorrelation of all channel pairs. It requires no prior training and executes in one fifth real time on modern architectures. Using meeting audio collected at several sites, we present error rates for the segmentation task which do not appear correlated with microphone type or number of speakers. We also present the resulting improvement in speech recognition accuracy when segmentation is provided by this algorithm.",

So far, only pronunciation dynamics in the time dimension, i.e., n-gram modeling on each of the phone sequences, have been examined. In the JHU 2002 Summer Workshop, we explored modeling the statistical pronunciation dynamics across streams in multiple languages (cross-stream dimension) as an additional component to the time dimension. We found that bigram modeling in the cross-stream dimension achieves improved performance over that in the time dimension on the NIST 2001 Speaker Recognition Evaluation Extended Data Task. Moreover, a linear combination of information from both dimensions at the score level further improves the performance, showing that the two dimensions contain complementary information.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal health is critically important for the welfare and performance of poultry. Enteric diseases that cause gut barrier failure result in high economic losses. Up till now there is no reliable faecal marker to measure gut barrier failure under field conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify a faecal protein marker for diminished intestinal barrier function due to enteric diseases in broilers. To assess this, experimental necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis in broilers were used as models for gut barrier failure. Ovotransferrin was identified as a marker for gut barrier failure using a proteomics approach on samples from chickens with necrotic enteritis. These results were confirmed via ELISA on samples derived from both necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis trials, where faecal ovotransferrin levels were significantly correlated with the severity of gut barrier failure caused by either coccidiosis or necrotic enteritis. This indicates that faecal ovotransferrin quantification may represent a valuable tool to measure gut barrier failure caused by enteric pathogens.",

Combining with the practice of the subject item storehouse and basing on classical test theory, this thesis puts forward a mathematical model on the two dimensional spaces including the dimension of the fundamental parameter and the dimension of the protucting test paper, in order to reveal the essential feature of the subjece item store house and provide the theoritical evidence on the every subjeet item store house.",
