A strong longitudinal thread is cross-domain adaptation and generalization (e.g., source-free, open-vocabulary, unsupervised), increasingly guided by disentanglement, information bottleneck, and causal reasoning. Recent work emphasizes efficiency (label-, data-, and demonstration-efficient learning), personalization (via personality, physiology, or user context), and responsible deployment (privacy, uncertainty, subjectivity, ethics). There is a clear evolution from early image-centric emotion prediction toward foundation-model-aware, dialogue- and healthcare-integrated, and psychologically informed affective systems.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background This study aimed to compare the renal protective effects and safety profile of finerenone plus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy versus monotherapy in patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. Methods The retrospective study evaluated 76 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (2023–24). Participants were divided into three groups: finerenone plus SGLT2i group (n = 26), finerenone monotherapy group (n = 32) and SGLT2i monotherapy group (n = 18). Changes in urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 3 and 6 months were evaluated. Safety assessments focused on hyperkalemia incidence and treatment-emergent adverse events. Results The combination therapy demonstrated superior proteinuria reduction compared with monotherapies, with median UPCR reductions of 40.89% at Month 3 and 54.62% at Month 6 versus 23.72%/30.88% (finerenone) and 24.69%/24.69% (SGLT2i) (all P &amp;lt; .05). Significantly more patients achieved ≥50% UPCR reduction in the finerenone plus SGLT2i group at Month 6 (53.8% vs 25.0% and 22.2%, P = .033). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated adjusted odds ratios ranging from 3.87 to 18.90 for finerenone plus SGLT2i therapy achieving ≥50% proteinuria reduction (all P &amp;lt; .05). Renal function parameters remained stable in all treatment groups without significant intergroup differences (all P &amp;gt; .05). The safety profile showed comparable hyperkalemia incidence rates between groups (P = .332). No severe adverse events or treatment withdrawals attributable to hyperkalemia were observed. Conclusion Our study shows that combined finerenone-SGLT2i therapy has a more rapid and superior proteinuria reduction versus monotherapy in IgA nephropathy, with preserved renal function and good safety.",

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts.",

      "abstract": "Visual emotion recognition (VER), which aims to understand human emotional reactions to different visual stimuli, has garnered increasing attention. However, the inherent ambiguity of emotional features presents significant challenges for data annotation in supervised learning paradigms. To address this limitation, emotion domain adaptation (EDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains. Recently, large visual-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive transfer performance on traditional UDA tasks. However, when generalizing to more abstract concepts such as emotion, the misalignment between CLIP and emotion spaces greatly affects the model performance. To address these challenges, we propose a CLIP-based emotion disentanglement (EmoD) framework designed for EDA. Leveraging perspectives from information bottleneck theory, EmoD implements a disentangler network that extracts emotion-specific features while removing redundant emotion-agnostic information. It also incorporates cross-domain feature alignment to reduce the affective gap between domains. Experimental evaluations in six EDA settings demonstrate that EmoD achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing traditional CLIP-based UDA methods by an average of 2.53%.",

This paper presents a rigorous empirical comparison of two different Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines-COLMAP and OpenMVG-and a recent deep learning-based method ACEZero (ACE0), when confronted with such adverse imaging conditions. Using a high-resolution RGB images dataset representative of typical glacier scenes, we quantify reconstruction quality through point-cloud density, root-mean-square reprojection error (RMSE), and Chamfer distance to ground-truth geometry, while profiling computational efficiency in terms of run-time and hardware utilisation (CPU, GPU, RAM, VRAM). OpenMVG achieves the densest point cloud (1.48 M points) and the lowest RMSE (0.68 px), but suffers from substantial global shape deviation (Chamfer distance 429 px) and the longest execution time (7.2 h). ACEZero delivers an order-of-magnitude speed-up (0.8 h) with moderate GPU usage, yet reconstructs the fewest points (0.10 M) and exhibits the highest RMSE (3.58 px). COLMAP offers the most balanced performance, combining competitive density (0.52 M points), low Chamfer distance (28 px) and moderate resource demand (3.2 h). The results delineate clear trade-offs among accuracy, completeness, and computational cost, furnishing practical guidance for selecting an appropriate pipeline under varying operational and hardware constraints.",

      "abstract": "In practical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, deep neural networks (DNNs) often encounter challenges arising from covariate shifts (differences in feature distributions) and category shifts (discrepancies in label spaces), which significantly degrade their generalization performance. To mitigate these issues, universal federated domain adaptation (UFDA) techniques have been proposed to train a global model that can classify known and unknown categories while keeping data private. Nevertheless, most existing methods still struggle to precisely identify samples belonging to unknown classes in the target domain due to the unavailability of data from the source domain clients. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, termed one-vs-all self-supervision (OSS) for IoT scenario. Specifically, OSS mainly consists of following three components. First, one-vs-all pseudo-label generation is proposed to generate high-quality pseudo-labels by leveraging source client models. Subsequently, we design a category-diverse strategy to aggregate the source models by assigning appropriate weights to each source domain client. Finally, we implement a target self-supervised learning strategy to refine feature alignment with respect to cluster centers. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017+ImageCLEF-DA, and Digits. The results show that our proposed OSS method achieves state-of-the-art performance in UFDA, significantly enhancing the recognition accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint compression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high accuracy, fast inference speed, and favorable transferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.",

      "abstract": "Temporal modeling plays an important role in the effective adaption of the powerful pretrained text-image foundation model into text-video retrieval. However, existing methods often rely on additional heavy trainable modules, such as transformer or BiLSTM, which are inefficient. In contrast, we avoid introducing such heavy components by leveraging frozen foundation models. To this end, we propose temporal modeling with frozen vision-language foundation models (TFVL) to model the temporal dynamics with fixed encoders. Specifically, text encoder temporal modeling (TextTemp) and image encoder temporal modeling (ImageTemp) apply frozen text and image encoders within the video head and video backbone, respectively. TextTemp uses a frozen text encoder to interpret frame representations as \"visual words\" within a temporal \"sentence,\" capturing temporal dependencies. On the other hand, ImageTemp uses a frozen image encoder to treat all frame tokens as a unified visual entity, learning spatiotemporal information. The total trainable parameters of our method, comprising a lightweight projection and several prompt tokens, are significantly fewer than those in other existing methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, ActivityNet, and LSMDC. Compared with full fine-tuning on MSR-VTT, our TFVL achieves an average 3.25% gain in R@1 with merely 0.35% of the parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TFVL outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer parameters.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However, their autoregressive nature leads to substantial inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications. Speculative sampling mitigates this issue by introducing a drafting phase followed by a parallel validation phase, enabling faster token generation and verification. Existing approaches, however, overlook the inherent coherence in text generation, limiting their efficiency. To address this gap, we propose a Speculative Sampling with Syntactic and Semantic Coherence (S$^4$C) framework, which extends speculative sampling by leveraging multi-head drafting for rapid token generation and a continuous verification tree for efficient candidate validation and feature reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^4$C surpasses baseline methods across mainstream tasks, offering enhanced efficiency, parallelism, and the ability to generate more valid tokens with fewer computational resources. On Spec-bench benchmarks, S$^4$C achieves an acceleration ratio of 2.26x-2.60x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pre-training model CLIP for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment discrepancies, we propose Image-To-Video Alignment Distillation, which leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous methods by 2.2% R@1 and 7.5% R@sum.

      "abstract": "AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details, and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable Image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments. Our project is at https://yfthu.github.io/HEIE/.",

      "abstract": "Multi-instance learning (MIL) has demonstrated impressive performance in whole slide image (WSI) analysis. However, existing approaches struggle with undesirable results and unbearable computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has offered a feasible solution for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity. However, vanilla Mamba inherently suffers from contextual forgetting issues, making it ill-suited for capturing global dependencies across instances in large-scale WSIs. To address this, we propose a memory-driven Mamba network, dubbed M3amba, to fully explore the global latent relations among instances. Specifically, M3amba retains and iteratively updates historical information with a dynamic memory bank (DMB), thus overcoming the catastrophic forgetting defects of Mamba for long-term context representation. For better feature representation, M3amba involves an intra-group bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) block to refine local interactions within groups. Meanwhile, we additionally perform cross-attention fusion to incorporate relevant historical information across groups, facilitating richer inter-group connections. The joint learning of inter- and intra-group representations with memory merits enables M3amba with a more powerful capability for achieving accurate and comprehensive WSI representation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that M3amba outperforms the state-of-the-art by 6.2% and 7.0% in accuracy on the TCGA BRCA and TCGA Lung datasets while maintaining low computational costs.",

      "abstract": "The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability. Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval, presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized. A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL baseline.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal recommendation faces an issue of the performance degradation that the uni-modal recommendation sometimes achieves the better performance. A possible reason is that the unreliable item modality data hurts the fusion result. Several existing studies have introduced weights for different modalities to reduce the contribution of the unreliable modality data in predicting the final user rating. However, they fail to provide appropriate supervisions for learning the modality weights, making the learned weights imprecise. Therefore, we propose a modality reliability guided multimodal recommendation framework that uniquely learns the modality weights supervised by the modality reliability. Considering that there is no explicit label provided for modality reliability, we resort to automatically identify it through the BPR recommendation objective. In particular, we define a modality reliability vector as the supervision label by the difference between modality-specific user ratings to positive and negative items, where a larger difference indicates a higher reliability of the modality as the BPR objective is better satisfied. Furthermore, to enhance the effectiveness of the supervision, we calculate the confidence level for the modality reliability vector, which dynamically adjusts the supervision strength and eliminates the harmful supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) aims to evaluate image quality in line with human perception, without reference benchmarks. Currently, deep learning BIQA methods typically depend on using features from high-level tasks for transfer learning. However, the inherent differences between BIQA and these high-level tasks inevitably introduce noise into the quality-aware features. In this paper, we take an initial step toward exploring the diffusion model for feature denoising in BIQA, namely Perceptual Feature Diffusion for IQA (PFD-IQA), which aims to remove noise from quality-aware features. Specifically, 1) we propose a Perceptual Prior Discovery and Aggregation module to establish two auxiliary tasks to discover potential low-level features in images that are used to aggregate perceptual textual prompt conditions for the diffusion model. 2) we propose a Perceptual Conditional Feature Refinement strategy, which matches noisy features to predefined denoising trajectories and then performs exact feature denoising based on textual prompt conditions. By incorporating a lightweight denoiser and requiring only a few feature denoising steps (e.g., just five iterations), our PFD-IQA framework achieves superior performance across eight standard BIQA datasets, validating its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Visual emotion recognition (VER), which aims at understanding humans' emotional reactions toward different visual stimuli, has attracted increasing attention. Given the subjective and ambiguous characteristics of emotion, annotating a reliable large-scale dataset is hard. For reducing reliance on data labeling, domain adaptation offers an alternative solution by adapting models trained on labeled source data to unlabeled target data. Conventional domain adaptation methods require access to source data. However, due to privacy concerns, source emotional data may be inaccessible. To address this issue, we propose an unexplored task: source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for VER, which does not have access to source data during the adaptation process. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework termed Bridge then Begin Anew (BBA), which consists of two steps: domain-bridged model generation (DMG) and target-related model adaptation (TMA). First, the DMG bridges cross-domain gaps by generating an intermediate model, avoiding direct alignment between two VER datasets with significant differences. Then, the TMA begins training the target model anew to fit the target structure, avoiding the influence of source-specific knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted on six SFDA settings for VER. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BBA, which achieves remarkable performance gains compared with state-of-the-art SFDA methods and outperforms representative unsupervised domain adaptation approaches.",

      "abstract": "Video Large Language Models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities, yet their practical deployment is hindered by substantial inference costs caused by redundant video tokens. Existing pruning techniques fail to effectively exploit the spatiotemporal redundancy present in video data. To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic analysis of video redundancy from two perspectives: temporal context and visual context. Leveraging these insights, we propose Dynamic Density Pruning for Fast Video LLMs termed FastVID. Specifically, FastVID dynamically partitions videos into temporally ordered segments to preserve temporal structure and applies a density-based token pruning strategy to maintain essential spatial and temporal information. Our method significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining temporal and visual integrity. Extensive evaluations show that FastVID achieves state-of-the-art performance across various short- and long-video benchmarks on leading Video LLMs, including LLaVA-OneVision, LLaVA-Video, Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-VL. Notably, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, FastVID effectively prunes $\\textbf{90.3%}$ of video tokens, reduces FLOPs to $\\textbf{8.3%}$, and accelerates the LLM prefill stage by $\\textbf{7.1}\\times$, while maintaining $\\textbf{98.0%}$ of the original accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/LunarShen/FastVID.",

      "abstract": "Training-free video large language models (LLMs) leverage pretrained Image LLMs to process video content without the need for further training. A key challenge in such approaches is the difficulty of retaining essential visual and temporal information, constrained by the token limits in Image LLMs. To address this, we propose a two-stage method for selecting query-relevant tokens based on the LLM attention scores: compressing the video sequence and then expanding the sequence. However, during the compression stage, Image LLMs often exhibit a positional attention bias in video sequences, where attention is overly concentrated on later frames, causing early-frame information to be underutilized. To alleviate this attention bias during sequence compression, we propose Gridded Attention Pooling for preserving spatiotemporal structure. Additionally, we introduce Visual Summarization Tail to effectively utilize this bias, facilitating overall video understanding during sequence expansion. In this way, our method effectively Mitigates and Leverages attention Bias (LLaVA-MLB), enabling the frozen Image LLM for detailed video understanding. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be released.",

      "abstract": "Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) aims to identify emotions from visual content and has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications. Although deep learning-based methods have shown success in VER, they require extensive labeled data, which is costly. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods can reduce reliance on annotated data by transferring models trained on labeled datasets to unlabeled data. However, these methods assume that the source and target domains share the same label space. In practice, this assumption is often violated due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity in emotion labeling. To address this limitation, we propose a novel prompt learning paradigm for open-vocabulary visual emotion UDA, termed Domain-specific Ensemble Prompting (DSEP). DSEP leverages psychological emotion models to unify emotion labels into a common space in an ensemble manner, enhancing the open-vocabulary capabilities of UDA. It then combines ensemble label prompts with domain-specific content prompts to achieve open-vocabulary UDA. To our knowledge, we are the first to explore open-vocabulary adaptation for VER. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four public benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Panoramic semantic segmentation has garnered increasing attention due to its ability to provide comprehensive environmental perception. However, it requires a large number of annotated panoramic images to achieve satisfactory performance, which is costly. Recently, Domain Adaptation for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (DA4PASS) has been proposed to reduce the reliance on annotated data by transferring segmentation models trained on annotated pinhole images to unlabelled panoramic images. Previous DA4PASS methods mainly focus on aligning features between pinhole and panoramic images, overlooking the unique appearance characteristics of panoramic images, particularly object distortion. To address the appearance discrepancies between pinhole and panoramic images, we propose Gaussian Constrained Diffeomorphic Deformation Network (GCDDN), which applies a panoramic deformation transformation obtained by Gaussian kernels to the annotated pinhole images. Specifically, GCDDN predicts multiple Gaussian kernels and performs first-order horizontal/vertical differences to obtain a naturally smooth and reversible panoramic deformation field, which is diffeomorphic. Due to its universality, GCDDN can be integrated into any domain adaptation (DA) method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that integrating GCDDN leads to substantial improvements in both DA methods for pinhole images and those specifically designed for panoramic images, with a maximum gain of 1.80% in outdoor scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/jingjiang02/GCDDN.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Epoxy resin insulation materials are prone to micro‐damage such as scratches and electrical treeing, which can lead to a decline in insulation performance and threaten the safe operation of the entire system. Microcapsule‐based self‐healing technology is one of the most promising solutions to address the micro‐damage issues of epoxy resin. However, research has shown that when the microcapsule doping concentration exceeds 3 wt%, the mechanical strength decreases significantly, while a too low doping concentration affects the healing efficiency. This paper focuses on epoxy resin used in insulator core rods and addresses the contradiction between “low microcapsule introduction” and “high healing efficiency.” This work synthesizes magnetically targeted UV‐sensitive microcapsules suitable for self‐healing insulator core rods. During the curing process of the epoxy resin, the microcapsules can be directionally guided by a magnetic field to distribute in areas prone to damage, thereby ensuring repair efficiency while reducing the quantity of microcapsules used. The microcapsule shells possess UV‐shielding properties, ensuring the stability of the internal repair core material. When damage propagates to the capsules, the core material flows out and cures under UV light, completing the repair of the damage. Additionally, larger‐scale self‐healing epoxy rod specimens were fabricated, demonstrating excellent self‐healing performance against mechanical scratch damage and electrical treeing damage. In comparison, composite materials without microcapsules exhibited a reduction in tensile strength and breakdown strength to 69.06% and 74.77%, respectively, after mechanical damage. Post‐repair, the mechanical strength recovery rate reached 91.6%, and the breakdown strength recovery rate achieved 90.4%.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to leverage the complementary information from multiple modalities for affective understanding of user-generated videos. Existing methods mainly focused on designing sophisticated feature fusion strategies to integrate the separately extracted multimodal representations, ignoring the interference of the information irrelevant to sentiment. In this paper, we propose to disentangle the unimodal representations into sentiment-specific and sentiment-independent features, the former of which are fused for the MSA task. Specifically, we design a novel Sentiment-aware Disentangled Representation Shifting framework, termed SDRS, with two components. <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Interactive sentiment-aware representation disentanglement</b> aims to extract sentiment-specific feature representations for each nonverbal modality by considering the contextual influence of other modalities with the newly developed cross-attention autoencoder. <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Attentive cross-modal representation shifting</b> tries to shift the textual representation in a latent token space using the nonverbal sentiment-specific representations after projection. The shifted representation is finally employed to fine-tune a pre-trained language model for multimodal sentiment analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets, i.e., CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDRS framework not only obtains state-of-the-art results based solely on multimodal labels but also outperforms the methods that additionally require the labels of each modality.",

      "abstract": "Text-video retrieval, a fundamental task for associating textual descriptions with video content, has become increasingly important in the video domain. Most existing methods focus on the single-modality features only considering the knowledge within individual video or text modalities, often neglecting cross-modal interactions. However, a text description corresponds to a specific spatio-temporal content within a video, involving a certain segment of a frame sequence and distinct sub-regions within these frames. Therefore, we focus on the text-conditioned video features to bridge the modality gap. In this article, we propose Spatio-Temporal Attention for video-text retrieval, termed STAttn, which utilizes textual information to focus on the spatio-temporal video content. Our final text-conditioned video features are generated from the text-related video frames and the text-related regions within these frames. First, we propose the Spatial Text-Attention Module (STAM) to learn the spatial information within video frames. STAM introduces the text-related salient patches to capture more fine-grained details. Second, we propose the Temporal Text-Attention Module (TTAM) to learn the temporal relationships between video frames. Temporal Triplet loss is proposed in TTAM to enhance the attention toward the text-related frames. Thus, the two modules learn the text-related spatio-temporal content from both intra-frame and inter-frame aspects. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, MSRVTT, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo, demonstrate that our STAttn outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The practical use of the Transformer-based methods for processing videos is constrained by the high computing complexity. Although previous approaches adopt the spatiotemporal decomposition of 3D attention to mitigate the issue, they suffer from the drawback of neglecting the majority of visual tokens. This article presents a novel mixed attention operation that subtly fuses the random, spatial, and temporal attention mechanisms. The proposed random attention stochastically samples video tokens in a simple yet effective way, complementing other attention methods. Furthermore, since the attention operation concentrates on learning long-distance relationships, we employ the channel shift operation to encode short-term temporal characteristics. Our model can provide more comprehensive motion representations thanks to the amalgamation of these techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces competitive action recognition results with low computational overhead on both large-scale and small-scale public video datasets.",

      "abstract": "Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: 1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; 2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; 3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and 4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.",

To this end, a formation motion planning algorithm based on rigid graph theory and fluid disturbance algorithm is designed. First, aiming at the formation control problem under external disturbances, the graph theory is applied to describe the cooperative relationship between multiple UGVs. Then, considering the distance constraints between UGVs, a leader-follower formation controller is designed based on the backstepping method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the convergence of the proposed control method can be guaranteed. Furthermore, aiming at the formation motion planning of the UGVs under complex dynamic environments, a motion planning approach is developed by resorting to the fluid disturbance algorithm, in which the leader UGV plans the overall trajectory of the formation system, and realizes the obstacle avoidance of the UGV formation systems. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

This study examines the use of compound glycyrrhizin with fractional CO2 laser treatment for rosacea patients. From January 2018 to January 2022, 108 patients with rosacea lesions were randomly assigned to a control group (conventional treatment) and an observation group (glycyrrhizin plus laser treatment). Both groups received 12 weeks of therapy. Analysis using SPSS26.0 and GraphPad Prism 8.0 showed improvement in skin lesions and barrier function post-treatment. The observation group had fewer lesions and better skin hydration compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05). Adverse reactions were higher in the observation group but not significantly different (P&gt;0.05). The combination treatment enhances therapeutic effects, improves skin lesions, and strengthens the skin barrier, warranting promotion.",

      "abstract": "Prompt tuning achieves superior performance across a wide range of tasks, including multi-label zero-shot classification. Existing approaches employ multiple prompts to acquire comprehensive knowledge from categories, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and significant computational efficiency. However, two main challenges still exist in these methods that impede the full potential of generalization. First, the class imbalance is not carefully addressed. Despite some efforts to adopt re-weighted loss functions to alleviate the positive-negative imbalance, such strategies tend to exacerbate the class imbalance by over-suppression of labels with fewer samples and overfitting to dominant classes. Second, the multi-prompt methods neglect the interactions between prompts during parameter optimization, underestimating the potential of prompts and leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we present a novel framework named Dynamic Regulation in Prompt Tuning (DAR-Prompt). DAR-Prompt introduces three dynamic components: semantic regulator and debiased regulator to address the class imbalance, along with contrastive gradient regularization to enhance feature separation through prompt interactions during the backward pass. Specifically, the semantic regulator generates class-adaptive thresholds to compensate for tail classes and mitigate over-suppression, while the debiased regulator focuses on learning biased classes by rectifying overconfident predictions. Moreover, we apply dynamic regularization to the gradient update directions of prompts to promote orthogonality, thereby enhancing feature distinctiveness. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance, well demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

      "abstract": "Recently, single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection with single point supervision has drawn wide-spread attention. However, the latest label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) framework suffers from instability, excessive label evolution, and difficulty in exerting embedded network performance. Inspired by organisms gradually adapting to their environment and continuously accumulating knowledge, we construct an innovative Progressive Active Learning (PAL) framework, which drives the existing SIRST detection networks progressively and actively recognizes and learns harder samples. Specifically, to avoid the early low-performance model leading to the wrong selection of hard samples, we propose a model pre-start concept, which focuses on automatically selecting a portion of easy samples and helping the model have basic task-specific learning capabilities. Meanwhile, we propose a refined dual-update strategy, which can promote reasonable learning of harder samples and continuous refinement of pseudo-labels. In addition, to alleviate the risk of excessive label evolution, a decay factor is reasonably introduced, which helps to achieve a dynamic balance between the expansion and contraction of target annotations. Extensive experiments show that existing SIRST detection networks equipped with our PAL framework have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple public datasets. Furthermore, our PAL framework can build an efficient and stable bridge between full supervision and single point supervision tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/PAL",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in cable defect fault diagnosis. However, in actual engineering, the count of intact cable instances is invariably significantly greater than the flawed sample set, which substantially restricts the evaluation effectiveness of these techniques. Therefore, the document proposes a dynamic normalized supervised contrast network (MCAM-DNSCN) with a multi-scale composite attention mechanism to identify cable defect faults. First, a precision current sensor (TMR) based on tunnel magnetoresistance effect technology is used to capture the weak pulse current signal generated by partial discharge of high-voltage cables. It has sensitivity and low energy consumption characteristics, and shows significant advantages in weak magnetic field detection. Then a multi-scale adaptive feature extractor (MAFE) with bough significance modulation faculty is designed to obtain the phase-resolved partial discharge map (PRPD) and serve as comparative learning to effectively mine the characteristics of TMR partial discharge pulse current signals. Secondly, a multi-scale composite attention mechanism is crafted to adjust the feature weights output by MAFE, thereby improving the precision and confidence of defect identification. Then, an adaptive standardized guided comparison penalty metric for unbalanced conditions is presented, which equilibriums the contribution of each category of samples in the loss calculation through category normalization, and dynamically adjusts the weight according to the accuracy during the training process. Optimize the learning focus of the model and enhance the fault identification ability. Ultimately, the posited MCAM-DNSCN was employed in the diagnosis of cable defects and experimentally compared with other neural network models. The empirical outcomes demonstrated the superior performance of this method.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent fault diagnosis of high-voltage cable defects based on edge computing is a safe and reliable technology for high-voltage cable operation, which can provide better real-time performance and lower communication cost for fault diagnosis systems. However, existing lightweight diagnostic networks lack lightweight learning mechanisms for edge computing scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes a new multi-scale lightweight network based on adaptive pruning. First, a precision current sensor (TMR) based on tunnel magnetoresistance effect technology is used to capture the weak pulse current signal generated by partial discharge in high-voltage cables, and a weight-shared multi-scale convolution (WSMSC) is proposed, which can effectively extract the scales in partial discharge. Features and almost no increase in computing cost. This mechanism not only improves the completeness of feature extraction, but also improves fault diagnosis accuracy, which is especially suitable for resource-constrained edge computing environments. Then an inverse separable convolution (ISC) block is constructed to adjust the convolution order to further capture high-level features, achieve one-to-one matching of convolution kernels, and simplify the pruning process. The adaptive pruning technology proposed finally integrates the evaluation and pruning process into the training, avoiding the repeated evaluation, pruning and fine-tuning cycles in the traditional method, and can simultaneously train and optimize the network structure without manual intervention, which is beneficial to Deployment on an expanded spectrum of peripheral units. Empirical outcomes demonstrate that the precision and intricacy of the devised framework surpass those of other cutting-edge cable anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, the proposed network can be deployed on more general edge devices.",

      "abstract": "Micro-Doppler corner signature is a subset of Doppler feature, which arises from the relative motion of human limb nodes. However, conventional micro-Doppler signature extraction methods have low precision on radar images with strong clutter and low resolution restrictions, which is difficult to meet the demand of through-the-wall (TWR) detection. To address these issues, this paper proposes a micro-Doppler corner representation method based on image segmentation and dual-threshold Harris corner extraction. Specifically, clutter suppression is first achieved using mean filter and Butterworth filter, resulting in distinctive TWR range and Doppler profiles. Then, the micro-Doppler corner feature image is evenly divided into segments. Furthermore, a corner extractor with two thresholds is performed on each segment. The smaller threshold is employed for detecting a larger number of corners, while the larger threshold enhances the detection of precise corners. Finally, pseudo corners are removed by SUSAN method. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Video captioning, a challenging task that entails generating natural language descriptions of visual content, often fails to effectively grasp the essence of action semantics. To harness the power of action detection to facilitate a deeper understanding of the video content, we propose an action-driven method, named Hierarchical Semantic Representation and Aggregation (HSRA) network. This method explicitly exploits action clues with a hierarchical semantic representation module, which models visual semantics in a three-level structure: “object-action-event”. By employing learnable action queries, our approach injects extensive action semantics into the model, thereby enabling more accurate and context-rich captions. To further enhance semantic alignment and understanding, we introduce a semantic aggregation composed of a semantic interaction module and a semantic refinement module. This component facilitates the alignment of semantics across different levels and emphasizes key information, ultimately leading to significant improvements in semantic consistency between the video and generated captions. We performed extensive evaluations on two well-established public datasets, MSVD and MSR-VTT, and the findings consistently demonstrate that our proposed HSRA network outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "3D coastline reconstruction presents a significant challenge due to the complex and dynamic environment of coastal areas, characterized by fluctuating sea levels, vegetation, and irregular terrain. Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) technology offers a promising approach to addressing these challenges by enabling real-time mapping and pose estimation. Conventional V-SLAM methods, which are based on single-agent, are inadequate to meet the complex requirements of such environments. Consequently, multi-agent V-SLAM has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its implementation remains challenged by several unresolved issues. This paper examines the difficulties associated with multi-agent V-SLAM concerning synchronization and points out potential solutions to enhance its efficacy. Additionally, 3D coastline reconstruction is used as a case study to demonstrate the challenges encountered in real-world applications of multi-agent V-SLAM and to propose strategies for overcoming these obstacles.",

      "abstract": "Collecting large-scale multi-label data with full labels is difficult for real-world scenarios. Many existing studies have tried to address the issue of missing labels caused by annotation but ignored the difficulties encountered during the annotation process. We find that the high annotation workload can be attributed to two reasons: (1) Annotators are required to identify labels on widely varying visual concepts. (2) Exhaustively annotating the entire dataset with all the labels becomes notably difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a new setting, i.e. block diagonal labels, to reduce the workload on both sides. The numerous categories can be divided into different subsets based on semantics and relevance. Each annotator can only focus on its own subset of labels so that only a small set of highly relevant labels are required to be annotated per image. To deal with the issue of such missing labels, we introduce a simple yet effective method that does not require any prior knowledge of the dataset. In practice, we propose an Adaptive Pseudo-Labeling method to predict the unknown labels with less noise. Formal analysis is conducted to evaluate the superiority of our setting. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method on multiple widely used benchmarks.",

However, collecting large-scale high-quality datasets for training ESA models in a supervised manner is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult in practice.

Specifically, we first introduce the stimuli and characteristics of emotion and then illustrate seven typical training paradigms, followed by applications and future directions of LeESA.",

Although the use of coded aperture significantly improves the detection efficiency of the system, it’s difficult to reconstruct the XRD patterns due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. Our method introduces a prior that XRD patterns could be represented as a combination of basis functions. The method reduces the impacts of noise and background, and improves the reconstruction of XRD patterns. It will facilitate material discrimination, and allow us to speed up XRD scan.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics, and embodied intelligence have necessitated 3D perception algorithms. However, current 3D perception methods, especially specialized small models, exhibit poor generalization in open scenarios. On the other hand, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak 3D local spatial object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations. To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations. We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for a pre-trained MLLM and develop LLMI3D, a powerful 3D perception MLLM. Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of large language models has greatly advanced human-computer dialogue research. However, applying these models to specialized fields like maternity and infant care often leads to subpar performance due to a lack of domain-specific datasets. To address this problem, we have created MicDialogue, a Chinese dialogue dataset for maternity and infant care. MicDialogue involves a wide range of specialized topics, including gynecological health, pediatric care, pregnancy preparation, emotional counseling and other related topics. This dataset is curated from two types of Chinese social media: short videos and blog posts. Short videos capture real-time interactions and pragmatic dialogue patterns, while blog posts offer comprehensive coverage of various topics within the domain. We have also included detailed annotations for topics, diseases, symptoms, and causes, enabling in-depth research. Additionally, we developed a knowledge-driven benchmark model using LLM-based prompt learning and multiple knowledge graphs to address diverse dialogue topics. Experiments validate MicDialogue's usability, providing benchmarks for future research and essential data for fine-tuning language models in maternity and infant care.",

      "abstract": "Currently, most existing person re-identification methods use instance-level features, which are extracted only from a single image. However, these instance-level features can easily ignore the discriminative information because the appearance of each identity varies greatly in different images. Thus, it is necessary to exploit identity-level features, which can be shared across different images of each identity. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework, named X-ReID, to promote instance-level features to identity-level features by employing cross-attention to incorporate information from one image to another of the same identity, thus more unified and discriminative pedestrian information can be obtained. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our method over existing works. Particularly, on the challenging MSMT17, our proposed method gains 1.1% mAP improvements when compared to the second place.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various artificial intelligence areas and tasks. One precondition is that large-scale labeled training data is provided to train a neural network. Although recent self-supervised pre-training can utilize unlabeled data to learn discriminative representations, label information is still required for specific downstream tasks. In real-world applications, such as fine-grained recognition and pixel-level segmentation, human annotation might be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. One intuitive solution is to utilize other labeled datasets with similar desired tasks to perform cross-domain transfer. Domain adaptation and domain generalization aim to address this issue by enhancing the transferability of the models trained on the labeled source domains so that they can well adapt and generalize to the target domain. In this paper, we summarize recent methods in our group on open-world domain adaptation and generalization.",

      "abstract": "Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods typically overlook local manifold structures, leading to compromised discriminative capabilities in perceptual quality evaluation. To address this limitation, we present LML-IQA, an innovative no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) approach that leverages a combination of local manifold learning and contrastive learning. Our approach first extracts multiple patches from each image and identifies the most visually salient region. This salient patch serves as a positive sample for contrastive learning, while other patches from the same image are treated as intra-class negatives to preserve local distinctiveness. Patches from different images also act as inter-class negatives to enhance feature separation. Additionally, we introduce a mutual learning strategy to improve the model's ability to recognize and prioritize visually important regions. Comprehensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PLCC of 0.942 on TID2013 (compared to 0.908) and 0.977 on CSIQ (compared to 0.965).",

      "abstract": "Emotion detection is a critical technology extensively employed in diverse fields. While the incorporation of commonsense knowledge has proven beneficial for existing emotion detection methods, dialogue-based emotion detection encounters numerous difficulties and challenges due to human agency and the variability of dialogue content. In dialogues, human emotions tend to accumulate in bursts. However, they are often implicitly expressed. This implies that many genuine emotions remain concealed within a plethora of unrelated words and dialogues. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Causal Disentanglement Model founded on the separation of hidden variables, which effectively decomposes the content of dialogues and investigates the temporal accumulation of emotions, thereby enabling more precise emotion recognition. First, we introduce a novel Causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to establish the correlation between hidden emotional information and other observed elements. Subsequently, our approach utilizes pre-extracted personal states and utterance topics as guiding factors for the distribution of hidden variables, aiming to separate irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Causal Disentanglement Model to infer the propagation of utterances and hidden variables, enabling the accumulation of emotion-related information throughout the conversation. To guide this disentanglement process, we leverage the GPT4.0 and LSTM networks to extract utterance topics and personal states as observed information. Finally, we test our approach on popular datasets in dialogue emotion detection and relevant experimental results verified the model's superiority.",

      "abstract": "In many practical applications, it is often difficult and expensive to obtain large-scale labeled data to train state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Therefore, transferring the learned knowledge from a separate, labeled source domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain becomes an appealing alternative. However, direct transfer often results in significant performance decay due to domain shift. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this problem by aligning the distributions between the source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) is a powerful and practical extension in which the labeled data may be collected from multiple sources with different distributions. In this survey, we first define various MDA strategies. Then we systematically summarize and compare modern MDA methods in the deep learning era from different perspectives, followed by commonly used datasets and a brief benchmark. Finally, we discuss future research directions for MDA that are worth investigating.",

      "abstract": "Video summarization remains a challenging task despite increasing research efforts. Traditional methods focus solely on long-range temporal modeling of video frames, overlooking important local motion information that cannot be captured by frame-level video representations. In this article, we propose the Parameter-free Motion Attention Module (PMAM) to exploit the crucial motion clues potentially contained in adjacent video frames, using a multi-head attention architecture. The PMAM requires no additional training for model parameters, leading to an efficient and effective understanding of video dynamics. Moreover, we introduce the Multi-feature Motion Attention Network (MMAN), integrating the PMAM with local and global multi-head attention based on object-centric and scene-centric video representations. The synergistic combination of local motion information, extracted by the proposed PMAM, with long-range interactions modeled by the local and global multi-head attention mechanism, can significantly enhance the performance of video summarization. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark datasets, SumMe and TVSum, demonstrate that the proposed MMAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, resulting in remarkable performance gains.",

      "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is important for autonomous driving. However, existing deep learning-based methods easily suffer from performance degradation in real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap between training and testing. M3OD's domain gaps are complex, including camera intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, image appearance, etc. Existing works primarily focus on the domain gaps of camera intrinsic parameters, ignoring other key factors. Moreover, at the feature level, conventional domain invariant learning methods generally cause the negative transfer issue, due to the ignorance of dependency between geometry tasks and domains. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose MonoGDG, a geometry-guided domain generalization framework for M3OD, which effectively addresses the domain gap at both camera and feature levels. Specifically, MonoGDG consists of two major components. One is geometry-based image reprojection, which mitigates the impact of camera discrepancy by unifying intrinsic parameters, randomizing camera orientations, and unifying the field of view range. The other is geometry-dependent feature disentanglement, which overcomes the negative transfer problems by incorporating domain-shared and domain-specific features. Additionally, we leverage a depth-disentangled domain discriminator and a domain-aware geometry regression attention mechanism to account for the geometry-domain dependency. Extensive experiments on multiple autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization for M3OD.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications have greatly enhanced the perception capabilities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) by enabling information sharing to \"see through the occlusions\", resulting in significant performance improvements. However, developing and training complex multi-agent perception models from scratch can be expensive and unnecessary when existing single-agent models show remarkable generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new framework termed MACP, which equips a single-agent pre-trained model with cooperation capabilities. We approach this objective by identifying the key challenges of shifting from single-agent to cooperative settings, adapting the model by freezing most of its parameters and adding a few lightweight modules. We demonstrate in our experiments that the proposed framework can effectively utilize cooperative observations and outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in both simulated and real-world cooperative perception benchmarks while requiring substantially fewer tunable parameters with reduced communication costs. Our ource code is available at https://github.com/PurdueDigitalTwin/MACP.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of large pre-trained vision-language models, effectively transferring the knowledge embedded within these foundational models to downstream tasks has become a pivotal topic, particularly in data-scarce environments. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, especially prompt tuning, have garnered considerable attention. To better understand the nature of prompt tuning, we propose the concept of ``Information Density'' (ID) to indicate whether a matrix strongly belongs to certain feature spaces rather than being evenly distributed across various feature spaces. We suppose a higher ID with strong bias across some feature spaces naturally leads to excellent robustness and stability. Our research, inspired by the observation that generalizability is closely linked to the information density of the prompt matrix, introduces the Dense Information Prompt (DIP). DIP aims to enhance information density to improve generalization. Furthermore, DIP significantly reduces the number of tunable parameters and the requisite storage space, making it particularly advantageous in resource-constrained settings. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the superiority of DIP. Notably, DIP surpasses the latest state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin with an exceptionally small parameter count. Across a range of tasks spanning 11 datasets, DIP improves the average downstream accuracy of classic prompt tuning by up to 5.76% using merely 0.5K parameters.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a fully-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, in real-world scenarios, providing abundant labeled data even in the source domain can be infeasible due to the difficulty and high expense of annotation. To address this issue, recent works consider the Few-shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA) where only a few source samples are labeled, and conduct knowledge transfer via self-supervised learning methods. Yet existing methods generally overlook that the sparse label setting hinders learning reliable source knowledge for transfer. Additionally, the learning difficulty difference in target samples is different but ignored, leaving hard target samples poorly classified. To tackle both deficiencies, in this paper, we propose a novel Confidence-based Visual Dispersal Transfer learning method (C-VisDiT) for FUDA. Specifically, C-VisDiT consists of a cross-domain visual dispersal strategy that transfers only high-confidence source knowledge for model adaptation and an intra-domain visual dispersal strategy that guides the learning of hard target samples with easy ones. We conduct extensive experiments on Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-C, and Domain- Net benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed C-VisDiT significantly outperforms state-of- the-art FUDA methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bostoncake/C-VisDiT.",

      "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint \\underline{c}ompression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high \\underline{a}ccuracy, fast \\underline{i}nference speed, and favorable \\underline{t}ransferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.",

      "abstract": "Emotion and sentiment play a central role in various human activities, such as perception, decision-making, social interaction, and logical reasoning. Developing artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) for machines is becoming a bottleneck in human–computer interaction. The first step of AEI is to recognize the emotion and sentiment that are conveyed in different affective signals. Traditional supervised emotion and sentiment analysis (ESA) methods, especially deep learning-based ones, usually require large-scale labeled training data. However, due to the essential subjectivity, complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity, and subtlety, collecting such annotations is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult in practice. In this article, we introduce label-efficient ESA from the computational perspective. First, we present a hierarchical taxonomy for label-efficient learning based on the availability of sample labels, emotion categories, and data domains during training. Second, for each of the seven paradigms, i.e., unsupervised, semisupervised, weakly supervised, low-shot, incremental, domain-adaptive, and domain-generalizable ESA, we give the definition, summarize existing methods, and present our views on the quantitative and qualitative comparison. Finally, we provide several promising real-world applications, followed by unsolved challenges and potential future directions.",

      "abstract": "Existing methods on facial expression recognition (FER) are mainly trained in the setting when multi-class data is available. However, to detect the alien expressions that are absent during training, this type of methods cannot work. To address this problem, we develop a Hierarchical Spatial One Class Facial Expression Recognition Network (HS-OCFER) which can construct the decision boundary of a given expression class (called normal class) by training on only one-class data. Specifically, HS-OCFER consists of three novel components. First, hierarchical bottleneck modules are proposed to enrich the representation power of the model and extract detailed feature hierarchy from different levels. Second, multi-scale spatial regularization with facial geometric information is employed to guide the feature extraction towards emotional facial representations and prevent the model from overfitting extraneous disturbing factors. Third, compact intra-class variation is adopted to separate the normal class from alien classes in the decision space. Extensive evaluations on 4 typical FER datasets from both laboratory and wild scenarios show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art One-Class Classification (OCC) approaches.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of artificial emotional intelligence technology is revolutionizing the fields of computers and robotics, allowing for a new level of communication and understanding of human behavior that was once thought impossible. While recent advancements in deep learning have transformed the field of computer vision, automated understanding of evoked or expressed emotions in visual media remains in its infancy. This foundering stems from the absence of a universally accepted definition of \"emotion,\" coupled with the inherently subjective nature of emotions and their intricate nuances. In this article, we provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary overview of the field of emotion analysis in visual media, drawing on insights from psychology, engineering, and the arts. We begin by exploring the psychological foundations of emotion and the computational principles that underpin the understanding of emotions from images and videos. We then review the latest research and systems within the field, accentuating the most promising approaches. We also discuss the current technological challenges and limitations of emotion analysis, underscoring the necessity for continued investigation and innovation. We contend that this represents a \"Holy Grail\" research problem in computing and delineate pivotal directions for future inquiry. Finally, we examine the ethical ramifications of emotion-understanding technologies and contemplate their potential societal impacts. Overall, this article endeavors to equip readers with a deeper understanding of the domain of emotion analysis in visual media and to inspire further research and development in this captivating and rapidly evolving field.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, people are accustomed to posting images and associated text for expressing their emotions on social networks. Accordingly, multimodal sentiment analysis has drawn increasingly more attention. Most of the existing image-text multimodal sentiment analysis methods simply predict the sentiment polarity. However, the same sentiment polarity may correspond to quite different emotions, such as happiness vs. excitement and disgust vs. sadness. Therefore, sentiment polarity is ambiguous and may not convey the accurate emotions that people want to express. Psychological research has shown that objects and words are emotional stimuli and that semantic concepts can affect the role of stimuli. Inspired by this observation, this paper presents a new MUlti-Level SEmantic Reasoning network (MULSER) for fine-grained image-text multimodal emotion classification, which not only investigates the semantic relationship among objects and words respectively, but also explores the semantic relationship between regional objects and global concepts. For image modality, we first build graphs to extract objects and global representation, and employ a graph attention module to perform bilevel semantic reasoning. Then, a joint visual graph is built to learn the regional-global semantic relations. For text modality, we build a word graph and further apply graph attention to reinforce the interdependencies among words in a sentence. Finally, a cross-modal attention fusion module is proposed to fuse semantic-enhanced visual and textual features, based on which informative multimodal representations are obtained for fine-grained emotion classification. The experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "As a new cell-free therapy, exosomes have provided new ideas for the treatment of various diseases. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) cannot be used in clinical trials because of tumorigenicity, but the exosomes derived from hiPSCs may combine the advantages of iPSC pluripotency and the nanoscale size of exosomes while avoiding tumorigenicity. Currently, the safety and biodistribution of hiPSC-exosomes in vivo are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of hiPSC-exosomes on hemolysis, DNA damage, and cytotoxicity through cell experiments. We also explored the safety of vein injection of hiPSC-exosomes in rabbits and rats. Differences in organ distribution after nasal administration were compared in normal and Parkinson’s disease model mice. This study may provide support for clinical therapy and research of intravenous and nasal administration of hiPSC-exosomes.",

      "abstract": "As a promising network monitoring technique, in-band network telemetry (INT) helps to visualize networks in a fine-grained and real-time manner. Meanwhile, to address the overheads of INT, people have proposed a few selective INT (Sel-INT) approaches that only select a portion of packets in each flow to insert INT fields and distribute different types of INT fields over the selected packets. In this paper, we study how to use Sel-INT wisely in a network such that the tradeoff between monitoring accuracy/coverage and INT overheads can be balanced well. Specifically, we try to orchestrate the Sel-INT schemes of flows in both network- and flow-levels. For the network-level optimization, we model it as an INT planning problem in which the Sel-INT schemes of flows should be determined to maximize the information gain of INT as well as minimize the bandwidth overheads of INT. We formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to tackle the problem, prove its <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {N} \\mathcal {P}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> -hardness, and leverage Lagrangian relaxation to design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for it. The flow-level optimization considers a dynamic network environment, and we propose to combine deep learning (DL) based traffic prediction with Sel-INT, such that the Sel-INT scheme of each individual flow can be updated timely and adaptively. We implement the proposal in a small but real network testbed and experimentally demonstrate self-adaptive orchestration of Sel-INT with it.",

      "abstract": "More and more users are getting used to posting images and text on social networks to share their emotions or opinions. Accordingly, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a research topic of increasing interest in recent years. Typically, there exist affective regions that evoke human sentiment in an image, which are usually manifested by corresponding words in peoples comments. Similarly, people also tend to portray the affective regions of an image when composing image descriptions. As a result, the relationship between image affective regions and the associated text is of great significance for multimodal sentiment analysis. However, most of the existing multimodal sentiment analysis approaches simply concatenate features from image and text, which could not fully explore the interaction between them, leading to suboptimal results. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new image-text interaction network (ITIN) to investigate the relationship between affective image regions and text for multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modal alignment module to capture region-word correspondence, based on which multimodal features are fused through an adaptive cross-modal gating module. Moreover, considering the complementary role of context information on sentiment analysis, we integrate the individual-modal contextual feature representations for achieving more reliable prediction. Extensive experimental results and comparisons on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid optical/electrical datacenter network (HOE-DCN) uses the inter-rack networks that consist of both electrical Ethernet switches and optical cross-connects (OXCs), for better cost-efficiency and scalability. Meanwhile, to provision dynamic network services well, the operator of an HOE-DCN needs to deploy virtual networks (VNTs) and remap them adaptively. Therefore, this work studies the problem of VNT remapping in an HOE-DCN from a novel perspective, i.e., the remapping schemes should be optimized for not only the network status after the remapping but also the transition to realize it. Specifically, we model this problem as a bilevel optimization, where the upper-level optimization aims at selecting proper virtual machines (VMs) to migrate such that the estimated latency of VM migration can be minimized, and the lower-level optimization determines the actual scheme of VNT remapping for minimizing the number of resource hot-spots. We first formulate a bilevel mixed integer linear programming (BMILP) model for the bilevel optimization, and then propose a polynomial time algorithm based on enumeration to solve it approximately. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposal.",

In this report, we introduce a universal domain adaptation (UniDA) method by aggregating several popular feature extraction and domain adaptation schemes. First, we utilize VOLO, a Transformer-based architecture with state-of-the-art performance in several visual tasks, as the backbone to extract effective feature representations. Second, we modify the open-set classifier of OVANet to recognize the unknown class with competitive accuracy and robustness. As shown in the leaderboard, our proposed UniDA method ranks the 3rd place with 48.49% ACC and 70.8% AUROC in the VisDA 2021 Challenge.",

      "abstract": "We address the problem of domain generalizable object detection, which aims to learn a domain-invariant detector from multiple \"seen\" domains so that it can generalize well to other \"unseen\" domains. The generalization ability is crucial in practical scenarios especially when it is difficult to collect data. Compared to image classification, domain generalization in object detection has seldom been explored with more challenges brought by domain gaps on both image and instance levels. In this paper, we propose a novel generalizable object detection model, termed Domain-Invariant Disentangled Network (DIDN). In contrast to directly aligning multiple sources, we integrate a disentangled network into Faster R-CNN. By disentangling representations on both image and instance levels, DIDN is able to learn domain-invariant representations that are suitable for generalized object detection. Furthermore, we design a cross-level representation reconstruction to complement this two-level disentanglement so that informative object representations could be preserved. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on domain generalization for object detection.",

      "abstract": "To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power. Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features, respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second, we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

      "abstract": "Images can convey rich semantics and induce various emotions in viewers. Recently, with the rapid advancement of emotional intelligence and the explosive growth of visual data, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to affective image content analysis (AICA). In this survey, we will comprehensively review the development of AICA in the recent two decades, especially focusing on the state-of-the-art methods with respect to three main challenges - the affective gap, perception subjectivity, and label noise and absence. We begin with an introduction to the key emotion representation models that have been widely employed in AICA and description of available datasets for performing evaluation with quantitative comparison of label noise and dataset bias. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches on (1) emotion feature extraction, including both handcrafted and deep features, (2) learning methods on dominant emotion recognition, personalized emotion prediction, emotion distribution learning, and learning from noisy data or few labels, and (3) AICA based applications. Finally, we discuss some challenges and promising research directions in the future, such as image content and context understanding, group emotion clustering, and viewer-image interaction.",

      "abstract": "A hybrid optical/electrical datacenter network (HOE-DCN) integrates the benefits of electrical packet switching (EPS) and optical circuit switching (OCS) for better architectural scalability. Meanwhile, as each network service usually involves multiple virtual machines (VMs) that form a virtual network (VNT), how to reconfigure the VNTs in an HOE-DCN to adapt to the dynamic network environment becomes an interesting and important problem to tackle. In this work, we optimize the procedure of VNT reconfigurations that remap VNTs to given virtual network embedding (VNE) schemes, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i> , scheduling the required VM migrations and optical cross-connect (OXC) reconfiguration properly such that the overall VNT reconfiguration latency can be minimized. We first assume that all the VM migrations should be scheduled before the OXC reconfiguration to minimize service interruptions, and formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve the scheduling problem exactly. Then, with the same assumption, we propose a time-efficient heuristic to schedule parallel VM migrations in batches such that the bandwidth competition can be significantly relieved. Finally, we divide the OXC reconfiguration into several progressive steps, and design a joint scheduling algorithm to arrange VM migrations together with the OXC reconfiguration steps.",

      "abstract": "Compared with image-based UDA, video-based UDA is comprehensive to bridge the domain shift on both spatial representation and temporal dynamics. Most previous works focus on short-term modeling and alignment with frame-level or clip-level features, which is not discriminative sufficiently for video-based UDA tasks. To address these problems, in this paper we propose to establish the cross-modal domain alignment via self-supervised contrastive framework, i.e., spatio-temporal contrastive domain adaptation (STCDA), to learn the joint clip-level and video-level representation alignment. Since the effective representation is modeled from unlabeled data by self-supervised learning (SSL), spatio-temporal contrastive learning (STCL) is proposed to explore the useful long-term feature representation for classification, using self-supervision setting trained from the contrastive clip/video pairs with positive or negative properties. Besides, we involve a novel domain metric scheme, i.e., video-based contrastive alignment (VCA), to optimize the category-aware video-level alignment and generalization between source and target. The proposed STCDA achieves stat-of-the-art results on several UDA benchmarks for action recognition.",

      "abstract": "Due to its robust and precise distance measurements, LiDAR plays an important role in scene understanding for autonomous driving. Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on LiDAR data requires large-scale point-wise annotations, which are time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Instead, simulation-to-real domain adaptation (SRDA) trains a DNN using unlimited synthetic data with automatically generated labels and transfers the learned model to real scenarios. Existing SRDA methods for LiDAR point cloud segmentation mainly employ a multi-stage pipeline and focus on feature-level alignment. They require prior knowledge of real-world statistics and ignore the pixel-level dropout noise gap and the spatial feature gap between different domains. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named ePointDA, to address the above issues. Specifically, ePointDA consists of three modules: self-supervised dropout noise rendering, statistics-invariant and spatially-adaptive feature alignment, and transferable segmentation learning. The joint optimization enables ePointDA to bridge the domain shift at the pixel-level by explicitly rendering dropout noise for synthetic LiDAR and at the feature-level by spatially aligning the features between different domains, without requiring the real-world statistics. Extensive experiments adapting from synthetic GTA-LiDAR to real KITTI and SemanticKITTI demonstrate the superiority of ePointDA for LiDAR point cloud segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis of user-generated reviews or comments on products and services in social networks can help enterprises to analyze the feedback from customers and take corresponding actions for improvement. To mitigate large-scale annotations on the target domain, domain adaptation (DA) provides an alternate solution by learning a transferable model from other labeled source domains. Existing multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) methods either fail to extract some discriminative features in the target domain that are related to sentiment, neglect the correlations of different sources and the distribution difference among different sub-domains even in the same source, or cannot reflect the varying optimal weighting during different training stages. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level MDA framework, named curriculum cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (C-CycleGAN), to address the above issues. Specifically, C-CycleGAN consists of three components: (1) pre-trained text encoder which encodes textual input from different domains into a continuous representation space, (2) intermediate domain generator with curriculum instance-level adaptation which bridges the gap across source and target domains, and (3) task classifier trained on the intermediate domain for final sentiment classification. C-CycleGAN transfers source samples at instance-level to an intermediate domain that is closer to the target domain with sentiment semantics preserved and without losing discriminative features. Further, our dynamic instance-level weighting mechanisms can assign the optimal weights to different source samples in each training stage. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and achieve substantial gains over state-of-the-art DA approaches.

      "abstract": "Retrieving 3D shapes based on 2D images is a challenging research topic, due to the significant gap between different domains. Recently, various approaches have been proposed to handle this problem. However, the majority of methods target the cross-domain retrieval task as a pure domain adaptation problem, which focuses on the alignment but ignores the visual relevance between the 2D images and their corresponding 3D shapes. To fundamentally decrease the divergence between different domains, we propose a novel cross-domain learning network (CLN) for 2D image-based 3D shape retrieval task. First, we estimate the pose information from the 2D image to guide the view rendering of 3D shapes, which increases the visual correlations of the cross-domain data to eliminate the divergence between them. Second, we introduce a novel joint learning network, considering both the domain-specific characteristics and the cross-domain interactions for data alignment, which further compensates for the gap between different domains by controlling the distance of intra- and inter-classes. After the metric learning process, discriminative descriptors of images and shapes are generated for the cross-domain retrieval task. To prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the MI3DOR, SHREC'13, and SHREC'14 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, and significant improvements have been achieved compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The articles in this special section focus on multimodal affective computing of large scale multimedia data. Humans are emotional creatures. Emotion is present everywhere in our daily life and plays a vitally important role in our decisionmaking process. There are roughly two categories of modalities that are widely used by humans to express emotions: explicit affective cues and implicit affective stimuli. On the one hand, to distinguish whether an emotion is induced, one direct way is to check the physical changes of involved humans, such as facial expression, speech, action, gait, and physiological signals (e.g., electroencephalogram). These explicit affective cues can be directly observed and collected from an individual with specific sensors. On the other hand, the rapid development of digital photography and social networks has enabled humans to share their lives and expressing their opinions online using implicit affective stimuli, such as text, images, audios, and videos. The usergenerated content provides an implicit solution to analyze humans' emotions. Affective computing of explicit and/or implicit large-scale multimedia data is rather challenging due to the following reasons. First, the development of affective analysis is constrained by the affective gap between low-level affective features and high-level emotions. Second, emotion is a subjective concept, and thus affective analysis involves multidisciplinary understanding of human perceptions and behaviors. Finally, emotions are often jointly expressed and perceived through multiple modalities. Multimodal data fusion and complementation need to be explored.",

However, because of the presence of domain shift, the learned knowledge of the well-trained DNNs cannot be well generalized to new domains or datasets that have few labels. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) studies the problem of transferring models trained on one labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. In this article, we focus on UDA in visual emotion analysis for both emotion distribution learning and dominant emotion classification. Specifically, we design a novel end-to-end cycle-consistent adversarial model, called CycleEmotionGAN++. First, we generate an adapted domain to align the source and target domains on the pixel level by improving CycleGAN with a multiscale structured cycle-consistency loss. During the image translation, we propose a dynamic emotional semantic consistency loss to preserve the emotion labels of the source images. Second, we train a transferable task classifier on the adapted domain with feature-level alignment between the adapted and target domains. We conduct extensive UDA experiments on the Flickr-LDL and Twitter-LDL datasets for distribution learning and ArtPhoto and Flickr and Instagram datasets for emotion classification.

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;There are strong demands at the market to increase power and reliability for high power diode laser. In parallel to this the requirements for cooler and package for the high power diode laser increase. Superior heat dissipation capability and low thermal resistance are some of the key attributes for the diode laser package design in the near future. The most common method of removing the large amounts of waste heat in a diode laser is using a micro-channel cooler. However, a microchannel cooler requires water to meet demanding specifications to avoid failures due to corrosion, which increases the overall cost to operate and maintain the laser. We demonstrate advances in a new macro-channel water cooling diode laser which are designed to eliminate the failure mechanisms associated with micro-channel coolers, and enhance the laser heat dissipation and the long-term reliability. For the package adopting the high thermal conductivity material, the maximum output power is 100 W per bar in CW mode. Due to the advantage of compact design, high power, high reliability and fast axis collimation, the new diode laser has the potential to be widely used in many fields, such as pumping solid state laser, hair removal, industry and research. &amp;copy; 2021 SPIE. &amp;copy; 2021 SPIE.

      "abstract": "With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of people are accustomed to expressing their feelings and emotions online using images and videos. An emotion-based image retrieval (EBIR) system is useful for obtaining visual contents with desired emotions from a massive repository. Existing EBIR methods mainly focus on modeling the global characteristics of visual content without considering the crucial role of informative regions of interest in conveying emotions. Further, they ignore the hierarchical relationships between coarse polarities and fine categories of emotions. In this paper, we design an attention-aware polarity-sensitive embedding (APSE) network to address these issues. First, we develop a hierarchical attention mechanism to automatically discover and model the informative regions of interest. Specifically, both polarity-and emotion-specific attended representations are aggregated for discriminative feature embedding. Second, we propose a generated emotion-pair (GEP) loss to simultaneously consider the inter-and intra-polarity relationships of the emotion labels. Moreover, we adaptively generate negative examples of different hard levels in the feature space guided by the attention module to further improve the performance of feature embedding. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed APSE method outperforms the state-of-the-art EBIR approaches by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "Recently, hybrid optical/electrical datacenter networks (HOE-DCNs) have been considered as a promising DCN architecture, because they merge the merits of electrical packet switching (EPS) and optical circuit switching (OCS). This paper considers the reconfiguration of virtual networks (VNTs) in an HOE-DCN to address the dynamic nature of emerging network services. Specifically, we study the problem that given the original and new virtual network embedding (VNE) schemes of several VNTs, how to schedule parallel virtual machine (VM) migrations in batches to realize the VNT reconfiguration within the shortest time. We design two algorithms to reconFigure the inter-rack network in an HOE-DCN in steps, schedule VMs to migrate accordingly, and allocate bandwidth to the VM migrations. The first algorithm uses the one-shot approach, where all the VM migrations are conducted in parallel within the shortest possible time. We formulate a linear programming (LP) to solve the bandwidth allocations in it exactly. Next, to relieve the bandwidth competition introduced by the one-shot approach, we propose the second algorithm by leveraging the multi-shot approach, i.e., invoking multiple batches of parallel VM migrations such that the reconfiguration time can be further reduced. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposals.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale labeled training datasets have enabled deep neural networks to excel across a wide range of benchmark vision tasks. However, in many applications, it is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to obtain large quantities of labeled data. To cope with limited labeled training data, many have attempted to directly apply models trained on a large-scale labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled or unlabeled target domain. Unfortunately, direct transfer across domains often performs poorly due to the presence of domain shift or dataset bias. Domain adaptation (DA) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to learn a model from a source domain that can perform well on a different (but related) target domain. In this article, we review the latest single-source deep unsupervised DA methods focused on visual tasks and discuss new perspectives for future research. We begin with the definitions of different DA strategies and the descriptions of existing benchmark datasets. We then summarize and compare different categories of single-source unsupervised DA methods, including discrepancy-based methods, adversarial discriminative methods, adversarial generative methods, and self-supervision-based methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions with challenges and possible solutions.",

      "abstract": "With the development of both hardware and deep neural network technologies, tremendous improvements have been achieved in the performance of automatic emotion recognition (AER) based on the video data. However, AER is still a challenging task due to subtle expression, abstract concept of emotion and the representation of multi-modal information. Most proposed approaches focus on the multi-modal feature learning and fusion strategy, which pay more attention to the characteristic of a single video and ignore the correlation among the videos. To explore this correlation, in this paper, we propose a novel correlation-based graph convolutional network (C-GCN) for AER, which can comprehensively consider the correlation of the intra-class and inter-class videos for feature learning and information fusion. More specifically, we introduce the graph model to represent the correlation among the videos. This correlated information can help to improve the discrimination of node features in the progress of graph convolutional network. Meanwhile, the multi-head attention mechanism is applied to predict the hidden relationship among the videos, which can strengthen the inter-class correlation to improve the performance of classifiers. The C-GCN is evaluated on the AFEW datasets and eNTERFACE 05 dataset. The final experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Both images and music can convey rich semantics and are widely used to induce specific emotions. Matching images and music with similar emotions might help to make emotion perceptions more vivid and stronger. Existing emotion-based image and music matching methods either employ limited categorical emotion states which cannot well reflect the complexity and subtlety of emotions, or train the matching model using an impractical multi-stage pipeline. In this paper, we study end-to-end matching between image and music based on emotions in the continuous valence-arousal (VA) space. First, we construct a large-scale dataset, termed Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet), with over 140K image-music pairs. Second, we propose cross-modal deep continuous metric learning (CDCML) to learn a shared latent embedding space which preserves the cross-modal similarity relationship in the continuous matching space. Finally, we refine the embedding space by further preserving the single-modal emotion relationship in the VA spaces of both images and music. The metric learning in the embedding space and task regression in the label space are jointly optimized for both cross-modal matching and single-modal VA prediction. The extensive experiments conducted on IMEMNet demonstrate the superiority of CDCML for emotion-based image and music matching as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Existing methods on facial expression recognition (FER) are mainly trained in the setting when all expression classes are fixed in advance. However, in real applications, expression classes are becoming increasingly fine-grained and incremental. To deal with sequential expression classes, we can fine-tune or re-train these models, but this often results in poor performance or large computing resources consumption. To address these problems, we develop an Incremental Facial Expression Recognition Network (IExpressNet), which can learn a competitive multi-class classifier at any time with a lower requirement of computing resources. Specifically, IExpressNet consists of two novel components. First, we construct an exemplar set by dynamically selecting representative samples from old expression classes. Then, the exemplar set and new expression classes samples constitute the training set. Second, we design a novel center-expression-distilled loss. As for facial expression in the wild, center-expression-distilled loss enhances the discriminative power of the deeply learned features and prevents catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale FER datasets in the wild, RAF-DB and AffectNet. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as compared to state-of-the-art incremental learning approaches.",

      "abstract": "The symbiosis of network virtualization and software-defined networking (SDN) enables an infrastructure provider (InP) to build various virtual software defined networks (vSDNs) over a shared substrate network (SNT). To handle a dynamic network environment, the InP may need to reconfigure the mapping schemes of vSDNs for a variety of reasons. Although previous studies have addressed how to calculate the new virtual network embedding (VNE) schemes for vSDN reconfiguration under different objectives, the transition to migrate vSDNs from their original VNE schemes to new ones is still under-explored. Hence, this article studies how to realize parallel and hitless vSDN reconfiguration, by leveraging the “makebefore-break” scenario. We come up with a generic solution to optimize the transition to remap vSDNs to new VNE schemes, such that the remappings can be done in the parallel, hitless and resource-efficient manner, as long as the new VNE schemes are feasible. More specifically, our proposal is the multi-stage parallel vSDN reconfiguration based on maximal connected reconfigurable subgraph (MCRSG). To ensure the efficiency of our proposal, we formulate the optimization for selecting MCRSGs to reconfigure in each stage, and prove the NP-hardness of the problem. Then, we design an approximation algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation to solve it time-efficiently. Extensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm can obtain nearoptimal solutions quickly. In addition to the algorithmic study, we also realize our multi-stage parallel vSDN reconfiguration in a practical NVH system, and demonstrate its performance in a real network testbed. Our experimental study identifies in what condition losing of packets during remapping would be inevitable, studies the tradeoff between reconfiguration latency and packet loss rate, and reveal an empirical method to adjust key parameters of our NVH system, for adapting to various network environments.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid optical/electrical datacenter networks (HOE-DCNs) build inter-rack networks with both electrical Ethernet switches and optical cross-connects (OXCs), and have been considered as a promising DCN architecture. However, to adapt to the dynamic network environment, the reconfiguration of virtual networks (VNTs) in an HOE-DCN still faces the unique difficulty that the HOE-DCN's topology can change because of the one-to-one connectivity of OXCs. To the best of our knowledge, this problem still has not been fully explored. In this article, we address this problem, and consider how to achieve effective VNT reconfiguration in an HOE-DCN such that the IT resource usages in racks can be re-balanced with the migration of virtual machines (VMs). We first formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to describe the VNT reconfiguration. Then, we solve the problem with two steps, 1) obtaining the VM migration schemes to balance the loads on racks and 2) determining the reconfiguration schemes of related virtual links (VLs) and the OXC. For the first step, we propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm by leveraging linear relaxation. Then, we tackle the optimization of the second step by developing an algorithm that involves a linear-time dynamic programming and an integer linear programming (ILP). To solve the ILP time-efficiently, we propose another polynomial-time approximation algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation. Our simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approximation algorithms and verify that the overall procedure including them outperforms the existing approach.",

      "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) is a technique that transfers predictive models trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, with the core difficulty of resolving distributional shift between domains. Currently, most popular DA algorithms are based on distributional matching (DM). However in practice, realistic domain shifts (RDS) may violate their basic assumptions and as a result these methods will fail. In this paper, in order to devise robust DA algorithms, we first systematically analyze the limitations of DM based methods, and then build new benchmarks with more realistic domain shifts to evaluate the well-accepted DM methods. We further propose InstaPBM, a novel Instance-based Predictive Behavior Matching method for robust DA. Extensive experiments on both conventional and RDS benchmarks demonstrate both the limitations of DM methods and the efficacy of InstaPBM: Compared with the best baselines, InstaPBM improves the classification accuracy respectively by $4.5\\%$, $3.9\\%$ on Digits5, VisDA2017, and $2.2\\%$, $2.9\\%$, $3.6\\%$ on DomainNet-LDS, DomainNet-ILDS, ID-TwO. We hope our intuitive yet effective method will serve as a useful new direction and increase the robustness of DA in real scenarios.

      "abstract": "The hybrid optical/electrical datacenter networks (HOE-DCNs), which use both electrical Ethernet switches and optical cross-connects (OXCs) to interconnect top-of-rack (ToR) switches, have been considered as a scalable solution for the ever-increasing datacenter traffic. Meanwhile, the network services in an HOE-DCN generate various virtual network (VNT) requests, and their dynamic nature can degrade the optimality of their virtual network embedding (VNE) schemes as time goes on. Therefore, this paper studies how to realize cost-effective VNT reconfiguration (VNT-Recfg) in an HOE-DCN, such that its IT resource utilization can be balanced well. The problem has its unique difficulty because the topology of the substrate network (i.e., the HOE-DCN) can change in the VNT-Recfg due to the \"1-to-1\" connectivity of an OXC. We design the procedure of our VNT-Recfg to include two major algorithms, i.e., a selection algorithm to choose virtual machines (VMs) to migrate, and a reconfiguration algorithm to determine the reconfiguration schemes of VMs, virtual links (VLs), and the OXC. The selection algorithm is developed to maintain the IT balance degree, while the reconfiguration algorithm consists of two steps, 1) getting the VM migration schemes to re-balance the IT resource usage, and 2) calculating the reconfiguration schemes of related VLs and the OXC. For the first step, we formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and design a time-efficient heuristic. We solve the second step with a novel algorithm that leverages both dynamic programming and a lightweight ILP.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel characteristic view selection model (CVSM) to address the 2D image-based 3D object retrieval problem. This work includes two key contributions: 1) we propose a novel reinforcement learning model to estimate the 3D pose based on a 2D image; and 2) we render the pose-specific model to generate a representative angle view for retrieval applications. First, we define state, policy, action and reward functions to train an agent with the reinforcement learning framework, by which the agent can effectively reduce the computational cost of the characteristic view selection and directly obtain the 3D model pose. Second, to resolve the problem of computing similarity in the cross-domain between the virtual 3D model view and the real query image, we project them into the skeleton domain, and the skeleton information can effectively bridge the gap between the image and 3D model view for cross-media retrieval. To demonstrate the performance of our approach, we compare with some classic 3D pose estimation methods using the popular Pascal3D dataset. To demonstrate the performance of our approach in model retrieval, we collect a new dataset that includes pairs of 2D images and 3D objects, where 3D objects are based on the ModelNet40 dataset and 2D images are based on the ImageNet dataset, and we experiment with our method using the SHREC 2018 and SHREC 2019 databases. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition in user-generated videos plays an important role in human-centered computing. Existing methods mainly employ traditional two-stage shallow pipeline, i.e. extracting visual and/or audio features and training classifiers. In this paper, we propose to recognize video emotions in an end-to-end manner based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we develop a deep Visual-Audio Attention Network (VAANet), a novel architecture that integrates spatial, channel-wise, and temporal attentions into a visual 3D CNN and temporal attentions into an audio 2D CNN. Further, we design a special classification loss, i.e. polarity-consistent cross-entropy loss, based on the polarity-emotion hierarchy constraint to guide the attention generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging VideoEmotion-8 and Ekman-6 datasets demonstrate that the proposed VAANet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for video emotion recognition. Our source code is released at: https://github.com/maysonma/VAANet.",

      "abstract": "Existing domain adaptation methods on visual sentiment classification typically are investigated under the single-source scenario, where the knowledge learned from a source domain of sufficient labeled data is transferred to the target domain of loosely labeled or unlabeled data. However, in practice, data from a single source domain usually have a limited volume and can hardly cover the characteristics of the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) method, termed Multi-source Sentiment Generative Adversarial Network (MSGAN), for visual sentiment classification. To handle data from multiple source domains, it learns to find a unified sentiment latent space where data from both the source and target domains share a similar distribution. This is achieved via cycle consistent adversarial learning in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MDA approaches for visual sentiment classification.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks suffer from performance decay when there is domain shift between the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain, which motivates the research on domain adaptation (DA). Conventional DA methods usually assume that the labeled data is sampled from a single source distribution. However, in practice, labeled data may be collected from multiple sources, while naive application of the single-source DA algorithms may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source distilling domain adaptation (MDDA) network, which not only considers the different distances among multiple sources and the target, but also investigates the different similarities of the source samples to the target ones. Specifically, the proposed MDDA includes four stages: (1) pre-train the source classifiers separately using the training data from each source; (2) adversarially map the target into the feature space of each source respectively by minimizing the empirical Wasserstein distance between source and target; (3) select the source training samples that are closer to the target to fine-tune the source classifiers; and (4) classify each encoded target feature by corresponding source classifier, and aggregate different predictions using respective domain weight, which corresponds to the discrepancy between each source and target. Extensive experiments are conducted on public DA benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed MDDA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Our source code is released at: https://github.com/daoyuan98/MDDA.",

      "abstract": "Instance-correspondence (IC) data are potent resources for heterogeneous transfer learning (HeTL) due to the capability of bridging the source and the target domains at the instance-level. To this end, people tend to use machine-generated IC data, because manually establishing IC data is expensive and primitive. However, existing IC data machine generators are not perfect and always produce the data that are not of high quality, thus hampering the performance of domain adaption. In this paper, instead of improving the IC data generator, which might not be an optimal way, we accept the fact that data quality variation does exist but find a better way to use the data. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous transfer learning method named Transfer Learning with Weighted Correspondence (TLWC), which utilizes IC data to adapt the source domain to the target domain. Rather than treating IC data equally, TLWC can assign solid weights to each IC data pair depending on the quality of the data. We conduct extensive experiments on HeTL datasets and the state-of-the-art results verify the effectiveness of TLWC.",

      "abstract": "In many practical applications, it is often difficult and expensive to obtain enough large-scale labeled data to train deep neural networks to their full capability. Therefore, transferring the learned knowledge from a separate, labeled source domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain becomes an appealing alternative. However, direct transfer often results in significant performance decay due to domain shift. Domain adaptation (DA) addresses this problem by minimizing the impact of domain shift between the source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) is a powerful extension in which the labeled data may be collected from multiple sources with different distributions. Due to the success of DA methods and the prevalence of multi-source data, MDA has attracted increasing attention in both academia and industry. In this survey, we define various MDA strategies and summarize available datasets for evaluation. We also compare modern MDA methods in the deep learning era, including latent space transformation and intermediate domain generation. Finally, we discuss future research directions for MDA.",

      "abstract": "Cross-modality human behavior analysis has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. In this article, we focus on the cross-modality image-text retrieval problem for human behavior analysis, which can learn a common latent space for cross-modality data and thus benefit the understanding of human behavior with data from different modalities. Existing state-of-the-art cross-modality image-text retrieval models tend to be fine-grained region-word matching approaches, where they begin with measuring similarities for each image region or text word followed by aggregating them to estimate the global image-text similarity. However, it is observed that such fine-grained approaches often encounter the similarity bias problem, because they only consider matched text words for an image region or matched image regions for a text word for similarity calculation, but they totally ignore unmatched words/regions, which might still be salient enough to affect the global image-text similarity. In this article, we propose an Adaptive Confidence Matching Network (ACMNet), which is also a fine-grained matching approach, to effectively deal with such a similarity bias. Apart from calculating the local similarity for each region(/word) with its matched words(/regions), ACMNet also introduces a confidence score for the local similarity by leveraging the global text(/image) information, which is expected to help measure the semantic relatedness of the region(/word) to the whole text(/image). Moreover, ACMNet also incorporates the confidence scores together with the local similarities in estimating the global image-text similarity. To verify the effectiveness of ACMNet, we conduct extensive experiments and make comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr30k and MS COCO. Experimental results show that the proposed ACMNet can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin, which well demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed ACMNet in human behavior analysis and the reasonableness of tackling the mentioned similarity bias issue.",

      "abstract": "Traditional image aesthetics assessment (IAA) approaches mainly predict the average aesthetic score of an image. However, people tend to have different tastes on image aesthetics, which is mainly determined by their subjective preferences. As an important subjective trait, personality is believed to be a key factor in modeling individual's subjective preference. In this paper, we present a personality-assisted multi-task deep learning framework for both generic and personalized image aesthetics assessment. The proposed framework comprises two stages. In the first stage, a multi-task learning network with shared weights is proposed to predict the aesthetics distribution of an image and Big-Five (BF) personality traits of people who like the image. The generic aesthetics score of the image can be generated based on the predicted aesthetics distribution. In order to capture the common representation of generic image aesthetics and people's personality traits, a Siamese network is trained using aesthetics data and personality data jointly. In the second stage, based on the predicted personality traits and generic aesthetics of an image, an inter-task fusion is introduced to generate individual's personalized aesthetic scores on the image. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using two public image aesthetics databases. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in both generic and personalized IAA tasks.",

Specifically, we first lay out the network model, build a real network testbed that supports vNF deployment on kernel-based VMs, docker containers, and commercial SmartNICs, and then conduct experiments to measure the throughput and latency of traffic processing and memory usage of four types of vNFs implemented on them. Next, based on the measurement results, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to optimize the application-aware vNF-SC provisioning in the heterogenous NFV environment. Finally, we design and perform two experiments to demonstrate that our heterogeneous NFV environment can combine the advantages of VM/docker container/SmartNIC to provide enhanced flexibility for realizing on-demand and application-aware vNF-SC composition.",

      "abstract": "Simulation-to-real domain adaptation for semantic segmentation has been actively studied for various applications such as autonomous driving. Existing methods mainly focus on a single-source setting, which cannot easily handle a more practical scenario of multiple sources with different distributions. In this paper, we propose to investigate multi-source domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a novel framework, termed Multi-source Adversarial Domain Aggregation Network (MADAN), which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. First, we generate an adapted domain for each source with dynamic semantic consistency while aligning at the pixel-level cycle-consistently towards the target. Second, we propose sub-domain aggregation discriminator and cross-domain cycle discriminator to make different adapted domains more closely aggregated. Finally, feature-level alignment is performed between the aggregated domain and target domain while training the segmentation network. Extensive experiments from synthetic GTA and SYNTHIA to real Cityscapes and BDDS datasets demonstrate that the proposed MADAN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Our source code is released at: https://github.com/Luodian/MADAN.",

      "abstract": "Cross-modal image-text retrieval has been a long-standing challenge in the multimedia community. Existing methods explore various complicated embedding spaces to assess the semantic similarity between a given image-text pair, but consider no/little about the consistency across them. To remedy this situation, we introduce the idea of semantic consistency for learning various embedding spaces jointly. Specifically, similar to the previous works, we start by constructing two different embedding spaces, namely the image-grounded embedding space and the text-grounded embedding space. However, instead of learning these two embedding spaces separately, we incorporate a semantic consistency constraint in the common ranking objective function such that both embedding spaces can be learned simultaneously and benefit from each other to gain performance improvement. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, \\ie Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO. Results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on all three datasets, which can well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the introduction of semantic consistency. Our source code is released at: \\urlhttps://github.com/HuiChen24/SemanticConsistency.",

      "abstract": "We propose to harness the potential of simulation for semantic segmentation of real-world self-driving scenes in a domain generalization fashion. The segmentation network is trained without any information about target domains and tested on the unseen target domains. To this end, we propose a new approach of domain randomization and pyramid consistency to learn a model with high generalizability. First, we propose to randomize the synthetic images with styles of real images in terms of visual appearances using auxiliary datasets, in order to effectively learn domain-invariant representations. Second, we further enforce pyramid consistency across different \"stylized\" images and within an image, in order to learn domain-invariant and scale-invariant features, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on generalization from GTA and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, BDDS, and Mapillary; and our method achieves superior results over the state-of-the-art techniques. Remarkably, our generalization results are on par with or even better than those obtained by state-of-the-art simulation-to-real domain adaptation methods, which access the target domain data at training time.",

      "abstract": "Image emotion recognition attracts much attention in recent years due to its wide applications. It aims to classify the emotional response of humans, where candidate emotion categories are generally defined by specific psychological theories, such as Ekman's six basic emotions. However, with the development of psychological theories, emotion categories become increasingly diverse, fine-grained, and difficult to collect samples. In this paper, we investigate zero-shot learning (ZSL) problem in the emotion recognition task, which tries to recognize the new unseen emotions. Specifically, we propose a novel affective-structural embedding framework, utilizing mid-level semantic representation, i.e., adjective-noun pairs (ANP) features, to construct an affective embedding space. By doing this, the learned intermediate space can narrow the semantic gap between low-level visual and high-level semantic features. In addition, we introduce an affective adversarial constraint to retain the discriminative capacity of visual features and the affective structural information of semantic features during training process. Our method is evaluated on five widely used affective datasets and the perimental results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Images play a crucial role for people to express their opinions online due to the increasing popularity of social networks. While an affective image retrieval system is useful for obtaining visual contents with desired emotions from a massive repository, the abstract and subjective characteristics make the task challenging. To address the problem, this paper introduces an Attention-aware Polarity Sensitive Embedding (APSE) network to learn affective representations in an end-to-end manner. First, to automatically discover and model the informative regions of interest, we develop a hierarchical attention mechanism, in which both polarity- and emotion-specific attended representations are aggregated for discriminative feature embedding. Second, we present a weighted emotion-pair loss to take the inter- and intra-polarity relationships of the emotional labels into consideration. Guided by attention module, we weight the sample pairs adaptively which further improves the performance of feature embedding. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.",

The two layers are coupled by the kinematic and dynamic relations at the interface. Through linear stability analysis, a lubrication effect, which significantly reduces the destabilization threshold, is identified. Especially when the vibration frequency is low, the lubrication effect is seen to influence the transition between the harmonic and subharmonic instability modes. It is studied how far the system with two layers can be approximated by a single-layer system with a Navier-slip boundary condition at the bottom. In corresponding experiments it is found that the time-periodic excitation of the system creates a steady-state deformation of the bottom layer. This indicates nonlinear dynamics of the system and the violation of reversibility. The excellent agreement between experimental and theoretical results for the onset of the instability underpins the validity of the linear stability analysis.",

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art studies have demonstrated the superiority of joint modeling over pipeline implementation for medical named entity recognition and normalization due to the mutual benefits between the two processes. To exploit these benefits in a more sophisticated way, we propose a novel deep neural multi-task learning framework with explicit feedback strategies to jointly model recognition and normalization. On one hand, our method benefits from the general representations of both tasks provided by multi-task learning. On the other hand, our method successfully converts hierarchical tasks into a parallel multi-task setting while maintaining the mutual supports between tasks. Both of these aspects improve the model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than state-of-theart approaches on two publicly available medical literature datasets.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel at learning from large-scale labeled training data, but cannot well generalize the learned knowledge to new domains or datasets. Domain adaptation studies how to transfer models trained on one labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled or unlabeled target domain. In this paper, we investigate the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem in image emotion classification. Specifically, we develop a novel cycle-consistent adversarial model, termed CycleEmotionGAN, by enforcing emotional semantic consistency while adapting images cycleconsistently. By alternately optimizing the CycleGAN loss, the emotional semantic consistency loss, and the target classification loss, CycleEmotionGAN can adapt source domain images to have similar distributions to the target domain without using aligned image pairs. Simultaneously, the annotation information of the source images is preserved. Extensive experiments are conducted on the ArtPhoto and FI datasets, and the results demonstrate that CycleEmotionGAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art UDA approaches.",

      "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is to build recognition models for previously unseen target classes which have no labeled data for training by transferring knowledge from some other related auxiliary source classes with abundant labeled samples to the target ones with class attributes as the bridge. The key is to learn a similarity based ranking function between samples and class labels using the labeled source classes so that the proper (unseen) class label for a test sample can be identified by the function. In order to learn the function, single-view ranking based loss is widely used which aims to rank the true label prior to the other labels for a training sample. However, we argue that the ranking can be performed from the other view, which aims to place the images belonging to a label before the images from the other classes. Motivated by it, we propose a novel DuAl-view RanKing (DARK) loss for zeroshot learning simultaneously ranking labels for an image by point-to-point metric and ranking images for a label by pointto-set metric, which is capable of better modeling the relationship between images and classes. In addition, we also notice that previous ZSL approaches mostly fail to well exploit the hardness of training samples, either using only very hard ones or using all samples indiscriminately. In this work, we also introduce a sample hardness assessment method to ZSL which assigns different weights to training samples based on their hardness, which leads to a more accurate and robust ZSL model. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that DARK outperforms the state-of-the-arts for (generalized) ZSL.",

      "abstract": "With the prevalence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), assessing the aesthetics of an image has gained great advances recently. Individual users often have different aesthetic preferences on images, which we believe are mainly affected by their personality traits. However, most of the current aesthetics models predict a generic aesthetic score based on handcrafted and/or learned feature representations, which are unified and thus cannot reflect the individual differences during image aesthetic rating. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end personality driven multi-task deep learning model to address this problem. Firstly, both image aesthetics and personality traits are learned from the proposed multi-task model. Then the personality features are employed to modulate the aesthetics features, producing the optimal generic image aesthetics scores. The experimental results on two public databases show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Earlier work demonstrates the promise of deep-learning-based approaches for point cloud segmentation; however, these approaches need to be improved to be practically useful. To this end, we introduce a new model SqueezeSegV2. With an improved model structure, SqueezeSetV2 is more robust against dropout noises in LiDAR point cloud and therefore achieves significant accuracy improvement. Training models for point cloud segmentation requires large amounts of labeled data, which is expensive to obtain. To sidestep the cost of data collection and annotation, simulators such as GTA-V can be used to create unlimited amounts of labeled, synthetic data. However, due to domain shift, models trained on synthetic data often do not generalize well to the real world. Existing domain-adaptation methods mainly focus on images and most of them cannot be directly applied to point clouds. We address this problem with a domain-adaptation training pipeline consisting of three major components: 1) learned intensity rendering, 2) geodesic correlation alignment, and 3) progressive domain calibration. When trained on real data, our new model exhibits segmentation accuracy improvements of 6.0-8.6% over the original SqueezeSeg. When training our new model on synthetic data using the proposed domain adaptation pipeline, we nearly double test accuracy on real-world data, from 29.0% to 57.4%. Our source code and synthetic dataset are open sourced. https://github.com/xuanyuzhou98/SqueezeSegV2.",

      "abstract": "The combination of network virtualization and software-defined networking enables an infrastructure provider to create software-defined virtual networks (vSDNs) over a shared substrate network (SNT), for supporting new network services more timely and cost-effectively. Meanwhile, as both the services and traffic in the Internet are becoming more and more dynamic, how to properly maintain vSDNs in a dynamic network environment exhibits increasing importance but still has not been fully explored. In this paper, we conduct a study on how to realize proactive and hitless vSDN reconfiguration to balance the utilization of ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) in a dynamic SNT. Specifically, we consider both algorithm design and system prototyping. From the algorithmic perspective, we try to solve the problems of \"what to reconfigure\" and \"how to reconfigure\". A selection algorithm is designed to proactively choose the virtual switches (vSWs) that should be migrated to other substrate switches for balancing TCAM utilization, i.e., solving what to reconfigure. Then, for the problem of how to reconfigure, i.e., where to re-map the selected vSWs and the virtual links connecting to them, we formulate a mixed integer linear programming model to solve it exactly, and design two heuristics to improve time efficiency. Next, we move to the system part, implement the proposed algorithms in our protocol-oblivious forwarding enabled network virtualization hypervisor system, and conduct experiments to demonstrate proactive and hitless vSDN reconfiguration. The experimental results indicate that our proposal does make vSDN reconfiguration transparent to the vSDNs' virtual controllers and proactive, and when reconfiguring a vSDN with live traffic, it achieves hitless operations without traffic disruption.",

      "abstract": "Due to the subjective responses of different subjects to physical stimuli, emotion recognition methodologies from physiological signals are increasingly becoming personalized. Existing works mainly focused on modeling the involved physiological corpus of each subject, without considering the psychological factors, such as interest and personality. The latent correlation among different subjects has also been rarely examined. In this article, we propose to investigate the influence of personality on emotional behavior in a hypergraph learning framework. Assuming that each vertex is a compound tuple (subject, stimuli), multi-modal hypergraphs can be constructed based on the personality correlation among different subjects and on the physiological correlation among corresponding stimuli. To reveal the different importance of vertices, hyperedges, and modalities, we learn the weights for each of them. As the hypergraphs connect different subjects on the compound vertices, the emotions of multiple subjects can be simultaneously recognized. In this way, the constructed hypergraphs are vertex-weighted multi-modal multi-task ones. The estimated factors, referred to as emotion relevance, are employed for emotion recognition. We carry out extensive experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art emotion recognition approaches.",

      "abstract": "3-D object retrieval has been a hot research topic in recent years. Within such a field, view-based approaches are attracting increasing attention because of the flexibility of data representation as well as the reported state-of-the-art performance. One of the most important issues related to view-based 3-D object retrieval is how to learn embedding features that are discriminative across classes while being compactly distributed within each class. In this paper, we analyze the difference between the two tasks of classification and retrieval, and propose a novel way to learn a view-pooling feature via a triplet network. In addition, we propose a new loss, named cube loss, which is able to sample a number of triplets equal to the cube of the samples in a batch. With the new loss, both hard-negative and hard-positive pairs can be effectively investigated. The experimental results on the ModelNet benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Monocular image based 3D object retrieval is a novel and challenging research topic in the field of 3D object retrieval. Given a RGB image captured in real world, it aims to search for relevant 3D objects from a dataset. To advance this promising research, we organize this SHREC track and build the first monocular image based 3D object retrieval benchmark by collecting 2D images from ImageNet and 3D objects from popular 3D datasets such as NTU, PSB, ModelNet40 and ShapeNet. The benchmark contains classified 21,000 2D images and 7,690 3D objects of 21 categories. This track attracted 9 groups from 4 countries and the submission of 20 runs. To have a comprehensive comparison, 7 commonly-used retrieval performance metrics have been used to evaluate their retrieval performance. The evaluation results show that the supervised cross domain learning get the superior retrieval performance (Best NN is 97.4 %) by bridging the domain gap with label information. However, there is still a big challenge for unsupervised cross domain learning (Best NN is 61.2%), which is more practical for the real application. Although we provided both view images and OBJ file for each 3D model, all the participants use the view images to represent the 3D model. One of the interesting work in the future is directly using the 3D information and 2D RGB information to solve the task of monocular Image based 3D model retrieval.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has recently shown great potentials in learning powerful features for visual tracking. However, most deep learning-based trackers neglect localization accuracy in the evaluation process of candidates. What's more, they usually over-rely on the discriminative features in a single frame in the training process. Consequently, they may fail when the discriminative features are occluded or changed in the tracking phase. In this paper, we propose a novel localization-aware meta tracker (LMT) guided with adversarial features to address the above issues. First of all, we design a novel intersection over union guided method to effectively balance the problem of classification and localization accuracy. To further improve the robustness of our classifier, we creatively use adversarial features during offline training phase. Those adversarial features can effectively guide the classifier in learning how to better deal with the situation where the discriminative features are occluded or changed. Finally, benefiting from meta learning, our algorithm only needs to perform one iterative update on the first frame and it can perform well on the tracking sceneries. The extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our LMT compared with the state-of-the-art trackers on three benchmarks: OTB-2015, VOT-2016, and VOT-2018.",

TPVX realizes the virtualization of table resources in PDP with global consideration, i.e., when mapping tenant flow tables to physical switches, TPVX considers their table sizes and the pre-formatted sub-tables in the physical network to improve TCAM utilization and avoid memory fragmentation. Our experimental results verify that with TPVX, the utilization of the table resources in PDP can be improved dramatically and the extra processing latency due to the newly-introduced overheads can be maintained well simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks have performed well on various benchmark vision tasks with large-scale labeled training data; however, such training data is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Due to domain shift or dataset bias, directly transferring models trained on a large-scale labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled or unlabeled target domain often results in poor performance. In this paper, we consider the domain adaptation problem in image emotion recognition. Specifically, we study how to adapt the discrete probability distributions of image emotions from a source domain to a target domain in an unsupervised manner. We develop a novel adversarial model for emotion distribution learning, termed EmotionGAN, which alternately optimizes the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) loss, semantic consistency loss, and regression loss. The EmotionGAN model can adapt source domain images such that they appear as if they were drawn from the target domain, while preserving the annotation information. Extensive experiments are conducted on the FlickrLDL and TwitterLDL datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Affective social multimedia computing is an emergent research topic for both affective computing and multimedia research communities. Social multimedia is fundamentally changing how we communicate, interact, and collaborate with other people in our daily lives. Social multimedia contains much affective information. Effective extraction of affective information from social multimedia can greatly help social multimedia computing (e.g., processing, index, retrieval, and understanding). Besides, with the rapid development of digital photography and social networks, people get used to sharing their lives and expressing their opinions online. As a result, user-generated social media data, including text, images, audios, and videos, grow rapidly, which urgently demands advanced techniques on the management, retrieval, and understanding of these data.",

      "abstract": "Image captioning, which aims to automatically generate a sentence description for an image, has attracted much research attention in cognitive computing. The task is rather challenging, since it requires cognitively combining the techniques from both computer vision and natural language processing domains. Existing CNN-RNN framework-based methods suffer from two main problems: in the training phase, all the words of captions are treated equally without considering the importance of different words; in the caption generation phase, the semantic objects or scenes might be misrecognized. In our paper, we propose a method based on the encoder-decoder framework, named Reference based Long Short Term Memory (R-LSTM), aiming to lead the model to generate a more descriptive sentence for the given image by introducing reference information. Specifically, we assign different weights to the words according to the correlation between words and images during the training phase. We additionally maximize the consensus score between the captions generated by the captioning model and the reference information from the neighboring images of the target image, which can reduce the misrecognition problem. We have conducted extensive experiments and comparisons on the benchmark datasets MS COCO and Flickr30k. The results show that the proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on all metrics, especially achieving a 10.37% improvement in terms of CIDEr on MS COCO. By analyzing the quality of the generated captions, we come to a conclusion that through the introduction of reference information, our model can learn the key information of images and generate more trivial and relevant words for images.",

Recently, with the explosive growth of visual data, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to affective image content analysis (AICA). In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods comprehensively with respect to two main challenges -- affective gap and perception subjectivity. We begin with an introduction to the key emotion representation models that have been widely employed in AICA. Available existing datasets for performing evaluation are briefly described. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches on emotion feature extraction, personalized emotion prediction, and emotion distribution learning. Finally, we discuss some future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Despite the fact that attribute-based approaches and attention-based approaches have been proven to be effective in image captioning, most attribute-based approaches simply predict attributes independently without taking the co-occurrence dependencies among attributes into account. Besides, most attention-based captioning models directly leverage the feature map extracted from CNN, in which many features may be redundant in relation to the image content. In this paper, we focus on training a good attribute-inference model via the recurrent neural network (RNN) for image captioning, where the co-occurrence dependencies among attributes can be maintained. The uniqueness of our inference model lies in the usage of a RNN with the visual attention mechanism to \\textit{observe} the image before generating captions. Additionally, it is noticed that compact and attribute-driven features will be more useful for the attention-based captioning model. To this end, we extract the context feature for each attribute, and guide the captioning model adaptively attend to these context features. We verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach over the other captioning approaches by conducting massive experiments and comparisons on MS COCO image captioning dataset.",

Existing works mainly focused on modelling the involved physiological corpus of each subject, without considering the psychological factors. The latent correlation among different subjects has also been rarely examined. We propose to investigate the influence of personality on emotional behavior in a hypergraph learning framework. Assuming that each vertex is a compound tuple (subject, stimuli), multi-modal hypergraphs can be constructed based on the personality correlation among different subjects and on the physiological correlation among corresponding stimuli. To reveal the different importance of vertices, hyperedges, and modalities, we assign each of them with weights. The emotion relevance learned on the vertex-weighted multi-modal multi-task hypergraphs is employed for emotion recognition. We carry out extensive experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing unseen classes is an important task for real-world applications, due to: 1) it is common that some classes in reality have no labeled image exemplar for training; and 2) novel classes emerge rapidly. Recently, to address this task many zero-shot learning (ZSL) approaches have been proposed where explicit linear scores, like inner product score, are employed to measure the similarity between a class and an image. We argue that explicit linear scoring (ELS) seems too weak to capture complicated image-class correspondence. We propose a simple yet effective framework, called Implicit Non-linear Similarity Scoring (ICINESS). In particular, we train a scoring network which uses image and class features as input, fuses them by hidden layers, and outputs the similarity. Based on the universal approximation theorem, it can approximate the true similarity function between images and classes if a proper structure is used in an implicit non-linear way, which is more flexible and powerful. With ICINESS framework, we implement ZSL algorithms by shallow and deep networks, which yield consistently superior results.",

However, spatial convolutions are expensive in terms of model size and computation, both of which grow quadratically with respect to kernel size. In this paper, we present a parameter-free, FLOP-free \"shift\" operation as an alternative to spatial convolutions. We fuse shifts and point-wise convolutions to construct end-to-end trainable shift-based modules, with a hyperparameter characterizing the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate the operation's efficacy, we replace ResNet's 3x3 convolutions with shift-based modules for improved CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 accuracy using 60% fewer parameters; we additionally demonstrate the operation's resilience to parameter reduction on ImageNet, outperforming ResNet family members. We finally show the shift operation's applicability across domains, achieving strong performance with fewer parameters on image classification, face verification and style transfer.",

      "abstract": "One of the main barriers for deploying neural networks on embedded systems has been large memory and power consumption of existing neural networks. In this work, we introduce SqueezeNext, a new family of neural network architectures whose design was guided by considering previous architectures such as SqueezeNet, as well as by simulation results on a neural network accelerator. This new network is able to match AlexNet's accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark with $112\\times$ fewer parameters, and one of its deeper variants is able to achieve VGG-19 accuracy with only 4.4 Million parameters, ($31\\times$ smaller than VGG-19). SqueezeNext also achieves better top-5 classification accuracy with $1.3\\times$ fewer parameters as compared to MobileNet, but avoids using depthwise-separable convolutions that are inefficient on some mobile processor platforms. This wide range of accuracy gives the user the ability to make speed-accuracy tradeoffs, depending on the available resources on the target hardware. Using hardware simulation results for power and inference speed on an embedded system has guided us to design variations of the baseline model that are $2.59\\times$/$8.26\\times$ faster and $2.25\\times$/$7.5\\times$ more energy efficient as compared to SqueezeNet/AlexNet without any accuracy degradation.",

      "abstract": "With network virtualization, an infrastructure provider can create virtual software-defined networks (vSDNs) over a shared substrate network and lease them to service providers (SPs). This enables the SPs to run their Big Data applications in a short time-to-market, flexible and cost-effective way. However, in a dynamic network, both the instances of vSDNs and the traffic in each vSDN can change over time, which would degrade the optimality of the embedding schemes of vSDNs and even cause serious reliability issues. Therefore, in this work, we extend our protocol-oblivious forwarding (POF) based network virtualization hypervisor (NVH) system (i.e., PVX) to realize hitless vSDN migration to avoid ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) depletion. Specifically, we design the PVX system to realize the vSDN migration that is transparent to the controllers of vSDNs and would cause zero or very few packet losses. The proposed PVX is then implemented in a real network testbed, and we conduct experiments to verify its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "The existing methods for image captioning usually train the language model under the cross entropy loss, which results in the exposure bias and inconsistency of evaluation metric. Recent research has shown these two issues can be well addressed by policy gradient method in reinforcement learning domain attributable to its unique capability of directly optimizing the discrete and non-differentiable evaluation metric. In this paper, we utilize reinforcement learning method to train the image captioning model. Specifically, we train our image captioning model to maximize the overall reward of the sentences by adopting the temporal-difference (TD) learning method, which takes the correlation between temporally successive actions into account. In this way, we assign different values to different words in one sampled sentence by a discounted coefficient when back-propagating the gradient with the REINFORCE algorithm, enabling the correlation between actions to be learned. Besides, instead of estimating a \"baseline\" to normalize the rewards with another network, we utilize the reward of another Monte-Carlo sample as the \"baseline\" to avoid high variance. We show that our proposed method can improve the quality of generated captions and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset MS COCO in terms of seven evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale labeled training datasets have enabled deep neural networks to excel on a wide range of benchmark vision tasks. However, in many applications it is prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to obtain large quantities of labeled data. To cope with limited labeled training data, many have attempted to directly apply models trained on a large-scale labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled target domain. Unfortunately, direct transfer across domains often performs poorly due to domain shift and dataset bias. Domain adaptation is the machine learning paradigm that aims to learn a model from a source domain that can perform well on a different (but related) target domain. In this paper, we summarize and compare the latest unsupervised domain adaptation methods in computer vision applications. We classify the non-deep approaches into sample re-weighting and intermediate subspace transformation categories, while the deep strategy includes discrepancy-based methods, adversarial generative models, adversarial discriminative models and reconstruction-based methods. We also discuss some potential directions.",

      "abstract": "Computationally modelling the affective content of images has been extensively studied recently because of its wide applications in entertainment, advertisement, and education. Significant progress has been made on designing discriminative features to bridge the affective gap. Assuming that viewers can reach a consensus on the emotion of images, most existing works focused on assigning the dominant emotion category or the average dimension values to an image. However, the image emotions perceived by viewers are subjective by nature with the influence of personal and situational factors. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach that characterizes the categorical image emotions as a discrete probability distribution (DPD). To associate emotion with the visual features extracted from images, we present shared sparse learning to learn the combination coefficients, with which the DPD of an unseen image is predicted by linearly combining the DPDs of the training images. Furthermore, we extend our method to the setup where multi-features are available and learn the optimal weights for each feature to reflect the importance of different features. Extensive experiments are carried out on Abstract, Emotion6 and IESN datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

In this paper, we study how to realize the on-demand slicing of application-driven virtual software-defined elastic optical networks (vSD-EONs) based on the concept of ADN. We design the network system for on-demand application-driven vSD-EON slicing and demonstrate the building and operating of application-driven vSD-EONs with it experimentally. Specifically, our experimental demonstrations consider three scenarios: (1)&#x00A0;the tenant&#x2019;s application requires high availability for the data plane, (2)&#x00A0;the tenant&#x2019;s application is interactive and thus requires short end-to-end latency, and (3)&#x00A0;the tenant&#x2019;s application needs an enhanced physical-layer security guarantee. With an experimental testbed that consists of commercial optical transmission facilities, bandwidth-variable wavelength-selective switches, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, and high-performance servers with both optical and electrical ports, we verify that the proposed vSD-EON slicing system can build vSD-EONs on-demand according to tenants&#x2019; application demands and operate them correctly.",

In this paper, we apply the idea of software-defined wireless network virtualization (WiNV) to WiFi networks and design and demonstrate a novel network system, namely, ADE<sup>2</sup>WiNFV. The proposed system can orchestrate software-defined WiNV with network-function-virtualization-based mobile edge computing (MEC) to realize application-driven end-to-end (E2E) slicing over heterogeneous wireline/wireless networks. Our experimental demonstrations verify that ADE<sup>2</sup>WiNFV can realize application-aware E2E slices on demand, each of which contains not only guaranteed E2E bandwidth resources (i.e., in the forms of virtual links, virtual switches, and virtual access points) but also isolated IT resources (i.e., in the form of virtual network functions) to carry specific applications with QoS guarantees.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we design and implement a distributed network virtualization hypervisor (NVH) system, namely, DPVisor, which can provide superior network programmability based on protocol-oblivious forwarding to realize highly-available, scalable, and protocol-independent virtual software-defined network slicing. The experimental comparisons indicate that DPVisor achieves comparable performance as ONVisor (i.e., an OpenFlow-based ONOS benchmark), in terms of the message processing latency, message processing throughput, and failure recovery time. Moreover, to optimize the performance of the distributed NVH systems, we carefully adjust the consistency model used in the state synchronization of NVH instances and propose a local cache-based scheme to balance the tradeoff between the consistency and availability of network status. Our experimental results confirm that the message processing throughput of the distributed NVH systems can be greatly improved (i.e., for both DPVisor and ONVisor), while the data consistency among NVH instances is still maintained well.",

      "abstract": "Correlation filter (CF) has been widely used in tracking tasks due to its simplicity and high efficiency. However, conventional CF-based trackers fail to handle the scale variation that occurs when the targeted object is moving, which is one of the most notable unsolved problems of visual object tracking. In this paper, we propose a scalable visual tracking algorithm based on kernelized correlation filters, referred to as quadrangle kernelized correlation filters (QKCF). Unlike existing complicated scalable trackers that either perform the correlation filtering operation multiple times or extract many candidate windows at various scales, our tracker intends to estimate the scale of the object based on the positions of its four corners, which can be detected using a new Gaussian training output matrix within one filtering process. After obtaining four peak values corresponding to the four corners, we measure the detection confidence of each part response by evaluating its spatial and temporal smoothness. On top of it, a weighted Bayesian inference framework is employed to estimate the final location and size of the bounding box from the response matrix, where the weights are synchronized with the calculated detection likelihoods. Experiments are performed on the OTB-100 data set and 16 benchmark sequences with significant scale variations. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we leverage the protocol-oblivious forwarding (POF) to design a novel network system that can realize highly-efficient mobility management and overcome the drawbacks of existing approaches. Moreover, we explore the forwarding plane programmability provided by POF to realize dynamic virtual network function (vNF) deployment for traffic adaption. We implement our system and conduct experiments to verify that it functions well for NFV-assisted mobility management and achieves reduced handover latency and enhanced QoE.",

      "abstract": "Detecting events from massive social media data in social networks can facilitate browsing, search, and monitoring of real-time events by corporations, governments, and users. The short, conversational, heterogeneous, and real-time characteristics of social media data bring great challenges for event detection. The existing event detection approaches rely mainly on textual information, while the visual content of microblogs and the intrinsic correlation among the heterogeneous data are scarcely explored. To deal with the above challenges, we propose a novel real-time event detection method by generating an intermediate semantic level from social multimedia data, named microblog clique (MC), which is able to explore the high correlations among different microblogs. Specifically, the proposed method comprises three stages. First, the heterogeneous data in microblogs is formulated in a hypergraph structure. Hypergraph cut is conducted to group the highly correlated microblogs with the same topics as the MCs, which can address the information inadequateness and data sparseness issues. Second, a bipartite graph is constructed based on the generated MCs and the transfer cut partition is performed to detect the events. Finally, for new incoming microblogs, incremental hypergraph is constructed based on the latest MCs to generate new MCs, which are classified by bipartite graph partition into existing events or new ones. Extensive experiments are conducted on the events in the Brand-Social-Net dataset and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Current image emotion recognition works mainly classified the images into one dominant emotion category, or regressed the images with average dimension values by assuming that the emotions perceived among different viewers highly accord with each other. However, due to the influence of various personal and situational factors, such as culture background and social interactions, different viewers may react totally different from the emotional perspective to the same image. In this paper, we propose to formulate the image emotion recognition task as a probability distribution learning problem. Motivated by the fact that image emotions can be conveyed through different visual features, such as aesthetics and semantics, we present a novel framework by fusing multi-modal features to tackle this problem. In detail, weighted multi-modal conditional probability neural network (WMMCPNN) is designed as the learning model to associate the visual features with emotion probabilities. By jointly exploring the complementarity and learning the optimal combination coefficients of different modality features, WMMCPNN could effectively utilize the representation ability of each uni-modal feature. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmarks and the results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for emotion distribution prediction.",

      "abstract": "Existing works on image emotion recognition mainly assigned the dominant emotion category or average dimension values to an image based on the assumption that viewers can reach a consensus on the emotion of images. However, the image emotions perceived by viewers are subjective by nature and highly related to the personal and situational factors. On the other hand, image emotions can be conveyed by different features, such as semantics and aesthetics. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach that formulates the categorical image emotions as a discrete probability distribution (DPD). To associate emotions with the extracted visual features, we present a weighted multi-modal shared sparse leaning to learn the combination coefficients, with which the DPD of an unseen image can be predicted by linearly integrating the DPDs of the training images. The representation abilities of different modalities are jointly explored and the optimal weight of each modality is automatically learned. Extensive experiments on three datasets verify the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Image captioning is an important problem in artificial intelligence, related to both computer vision and natural language processing. There are two main problems in existing methods: in the training phase, it is difficult to find which parts of the captions are more essential to the image; in the caption generation phase, the objects or the scenes are sometimes misrecognized. In this paper, we consider the training images as the references and propose a Reference based Long Short Term Memory (R-LSTM) model, aiming to solve these two problems in one goal. When training the model, we assign different weights to different words, which enables the network to better learn the key information of the captions. When generating a caption, the consensus score is utilized to exploit the reference information of neighbor images, which might fix the misrecognition and make the descriptions more natural-sounding. The proposed R-LSTM model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark dataset MS COCO and obtains top 2 position on 11 of the 14 metrics on the online test server.",

The NVH, namely SR-PVX, uses a novel SR-based mechanism to ensure that the substrate switches can process packets from vSDNs with very small flow-table consumption. We design the network architecture, packet format, and packet processing procedure, and implement them to experimentally demonstrate that SR-PVX can control substrate POF switches to accomplish the SR-based vSDN slicing. We also perform an experiment to show that the POF-enabled vSDN created by SR-PVX can easily realize a stateful firewall with its POF-FIS programmability.",

      "abstract": "Images can convey rich semantics and induce various emotions to viewers. Most existing works on affective image analysis focused on predicting the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. However, such dominant emotion is often insufficient in real-world applications, as the emotions that are induced by an image are highly subjective and different with respect to different viewers. In this paper, we propose to predict the personalized emotion perceptions of images for each individual viewer. Different types of factors that may affect personalized image emotion perceptions, including visual content, social context, temporal evolution, and location influence, are jointly investigated. Rolling multi-task hypergraph learning (RMTHG) is presented to consistently combine these factors and a learning algorithm is designed for automatic optimization. For evaluation, we set up a large scale image emotion dataset from Flickr, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net, on both dimensional and categorical emotion representations with over 1 million images and about 8,000 users. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significant performance gains on personalized emotion classification, as compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Previous works on image emotion analysis mainly focused on predicting the dominant emotion category or the average dimension values of an image for affective image classification and regression. However, this is often insufficient in various real-world applications, as the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different. In this paper, we propose to predict the continuous probability distribution of image emotions which are represented in dimensional valence-arousal space. We carried out large-scale statistical analysis on the constructed Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset, on which we observed that the emotion distribution can be well-modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. This model is estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm with specified initializations. Then, we extract commonly used emotion features at different levels for each image. Finally, we formalize the emotion distribution prediction task as a shared sparse regression (SSR) problem and extend it to multitask settings, named multitask shared sparse regression (MTSSR), to explore the latent information between different prediction tasks. SSR and MTSSR are optimized by iteratively reweighted least squares. Experiments are conducted on the Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset with comparisons to three alternative baselines. The quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Images can convey rich semantics and induce strong emotions in viewers. My research aims to predict image emotions from different aspects with respect to two main challenges: affective gap and subjective evaluation. To bridge the affective gap, we extract emotion features based on principles-of-art to recognize image-centric dominant emotions. As the emotions that are induced in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different, we propose to predict user-centric personalized emotion perceptions for each viewer and image-centric emotion probability distribution for each image. To tackle the subjective evaluation issue, we set up a large scale image emotion dataset from Flickr, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net, on both dimensional and categorical emotion representations with over 1 million images and about 8,000 users. Different types of factors may influence personalized image emotion perceptions, including visual content, social context, temporal evolution and location influence. We make an initial attempt to jointly combine them by the proposed rolling multi-task hypergraph learning. Both discrete and continuous emotion distributions are modelled via shared sparse learning. Further, several potential applications based on image emotions are designed and implemented.",

      "abstract": "Crowd behavior analysis has recently attracted extensive attention in research. However, the existing research mainly focuses on investigating motion patterns in crowds, while the emotional aspects of crowd behaviors are left unexplored. Analyzing the emotion of crowd behaviors is indeed extremely important, as it uncovers the social moods that are beneficial for video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel crowd representation termed crowd mood. Crowd mood is established based upon the discovery that the social emotional hypothesis of crowd behaviors can be revealed by investigating the spacing interactions and the structural levels of motion patterns in crowds. To this end, we first learn the structured trajectories of crowds by particle advection using low-rank approximation with group sparsity constraint, which implicitly characterizes the coherent motion patterns. Second, rich emotional motion features are explicitly extracted and fused by support vector regression to reflect social characteristics. In particular, we construct weighted features in a boosted manner by considering the features' significance. Finally, crowd mood is intuitively presented as affective curves to track the emotion states of the crowd dynamics, which is robust to noise, sensitive to semantic shift, and compact for pattern expressions. Extensive evaluations on crowd video data sets demonstrate that our approach effectively models crowd mood and achieves significantly better results with comparisons to several alternative and state-of-the-art approaches for various tasks, i.e., crowd mood classification, global abnormal mood detection, and crowd emotion matching.",

      "abstract": "Understanding a scene provided by very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has become a more and more challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new method for scene classification based on saliency computing of patches sampling from the VHR images. Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) is then adopted to select the corresponding informative salient patches for image scene representation. The proposed technique for selecting informative salient patches is efficient and robust for scene understanding. We conduct experiments on the public UC Merced benchmark dataset, which contains 21 different areal categories with sub-meter resolution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Since the number of surveillance cameras in public areas increases very fast, massive crowd videos are captured and shared, which brings an urgent need to retrieve these videos efficiently and effectively. However, most recent research on crowd video mainly focused on crowd behavior understanding and abnormal detection. In this study, as the very first attempt, we propose a crowd video retrieval method via deep attribute-embedding graph ranking. Group profiling attributes are capable of reflecting rich crowd patterns in videos. To deeply embed the specific relationship and manifold structure of crowd patterns, we integrate graph ranking, optimized weights learning and deep metric transforming in a unified regularization framework for crowd video retrieval. To sufficiently explore the effects of multiple attributes and their complementation in crowds, we devise several scene-independent visual descriptors specifically for each crowd video. Interpretable descriptors are categorized into different levels and structures as group profiling attributes, according to semantic properties of crowd patterns. Extensive experiments conducted on CUHK crowd dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Images can convey rich semantics and evoke strong emotions in viewers. The research of my PhD thesis focuses on image emotion computing (IEC), which aims to predict the emotion perceptions of given images. The development of IEC is greatly constrained by two main challenges: affective gap and subjective evaluation. Previous works mainly focused on finding features that can express emotions better to bridge the affective gap, such as elements-of-art based features and shape features. According to the emotion representation models, including categorical emotion states (CES) and dimensional emotion space (DES), three different tasks are traditionally performed on IEC: affective image classification, regression and retrieval. The state-of-the-art methods on the three above tasks are image-centric, focusing on the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. For my PhD thesis, I plan to answer the following questions: (1) Compared to the low-level elements-of-art based features, can we find some higher level features that are more interpretable and have stronger link to emotions? (2) Are the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image subjective and different? If they are, how can we tackle the user-centric emotion prediction? (3) For image-centric emotion computing, can we predict the emotion distribution instead of the dominant emotion category?",

Different factors that may influence emotion perceptions, including visual content, social context, temporal evolution, and location influence are jointly investigated via the presented rolling multi-task hypergraph learning. For evaluation, we set up a large scale image emotion dataset from Flickr, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net, with over 1 million images and about 8,000 users. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Previous works on actor identification mainly focused on static features based on face identification and costume detection, without considering the abundant dynamic information contained in videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine representative actions of each actor, and show the remarkable power of such actions for actor identification task. Videos are firstly divided into shots and represented by BoW based on spatial-temporal features. Then we integrate the prototype theory with SVM to rank the shots and obtain the representative actions. Our method for actor identification combines representative actions with actors' appearance. We validate the method on episodes of the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\". The experimental results show that the representative actions are consistent with human judgements and can greatly improve the matching performance as complementary to existing handcrafted static features for actor identification.",

      "abstract": "Previous works on image emotion analysis mainly focused on assigning a dominated emotion category or the average dimension values to an image for affective image classification and regression. However, this is often insufficient in many applications, as the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different. In this paper, we propose to predict the continuous probability distribution of dimensional image emotions represented in valence-arousal space. By the statistical analysis on the constructed Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset, we represent the emotion distribution as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is estimated by the EM algorithm. Then we extract commonly used features of different levels for each image. Finally, we formulize the emotion distribution prediction as a multi-task shared sparse regression (MTSSR) problem, which is optimized by iteratively reweighted least squares. Besides, we introduce three baseline algorithms. Experiments conducted on the Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to some state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Dance is a special and important type of action, composed of abundant and various action elements. However, the recommendation of dance videos on the web are still not well studied. It is hard to realize it in the way of traditional methods using associated texts or static features of video content. In this paper, we study the problem focusing on extraction and representation of action information in dances. We propose to recommend dance videos based on the automatically discovered ``Dance Styles'', which play a significant role in characterizing different types of dances. To bridge the semantic gap of video content and mid-level concept, style, we take advantage of a mid-level action representation method, and extract representative patches as ``Dancelets'', a sort of intermediation between videos and the concepts. Furthermore, we propose to employ Motion Boundaries as saliency priors and sparsely extract patches containing more representative information to generate a set of dancelet candidates. Dancelets are then discovered by Normalized-cut method, which is superior in grouping visually similar patterns into the same clusters. For the fast and effective recommendation, a random forest-based index is built, and the ranking results are derived according to the matching results in all the leaf notes. Extensive experiments validated on the web dance videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for dance style discovery and video recommendation based on styles.",

However, this is often insufficient, as the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different. In this paper, we propose to predict the probability distribution of categorical image emotions. Firstly we extract commonly used features of different levels for each image. Then we formulize the emotion distribution prediction as a shared sparse leaning problem, which is optimized by iteratively reweighted least squares. Besides, we introduce three baseline algorithms. Experiments are carried out on a dataset of peer rated abstract paintings and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, as compared to some state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in the field of image and video processing have led to a renewed interest in sketch correlated research. With that, there have emerged considerable solid evidence which revealed the significance of sketch to us. However, there have been few profound discussions on sketch based action analysis so far. In this paper, we present a framework of converting human actions to commendable sketches and discovering distinctive action sketches. The action sketches should satisfy three characteristics: sketchability, objective-ness and consistency. Primitive sketches are prepared according to the structured forests based fast edge detection. Meanwhile, we take advantage of Struck to accomplish adaptive object tracking in parallel. After that, we propose a method to ensure the spatio-temporal consistency between every sequential action sketches. On completion of previous stages, the process of distinctive mining of action sketches is carried out. The experimental results show that our approach has a promising potential.",

      "abstract": "Many target tracking videos suffer from significant shake due to the undesirable camera motion or target vibration. These degraded video records have a negative impact on viewing experience as well as the follow-up analysis and application. Most existing digital video stabilization methods aim at removing camera shake using the techniques of global motion estimation and compensation between adjacent frames, while paying little attention to motion pattern and the relationship between the foreground and background contents. In this paper, we present a novel approach to stabilize the videos containing large dynamic object, which can realize the normal stabilization task and describe the target motion path at the meantime. We combine K-means and Gaussian mixture model to distinguish the motion modes of background and foreground without applying any prior knowledge about the moving object. The proposed approach gives a flexible choice in stabilizing background motion as traditional algorithms or foreground motion for salient target surveillance.",

      "abstract": "With various novel methods having been proposed, recent years witnessed great progress in abnormal event detection. Broadly speaking, most existing methods can be divided into two categories: global feature representation based ones and local feature representation based ones, though the specific feature model and scale differ a lot. These two types of methods have reverse pros and cons: global feature representation methods can better guarantee spatial-temporal continuity of abnormal events but lack the ability to accurately model features of the basic event elements, while local feature methods are just the opposite. That makes their results complement each other. In this paper, we propose to explicitly apply temporal continuity constraint on sparse coding based local feature representation method, not just enlarging the scale of local feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our method can usually achieve more stable and smooth results, thus more high detection accuracy. In some cases, the performance gain can be enormous.",

      "abstract": "As an effective and convenient intermediate means, sketch has been playing an important role in expressing human intentions. Aware of its significance, plentiful sketch related studies have been conducted, such as sketch based image retrieval and recognition. However, very few works have researched the intrinsic factors that make sketch look vivid. In this paper, we explore the key to a good sketch by a weak supervised approach to discovery discriminative patches for different categories of sketches. For each class, we randomly extract tens of thousands of patches at multiple scales, which are represented by Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG). Then all patches are thrown into an iterative detection process to find the most discriminative ones. Experimentally, we analyze the visual results and give a reasonable discussion about good and bad sketches. Furthermore, more experimental results on the TU-Berlin sketch benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as compared to other available approaches.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the authors propose a collaborative composition model for automatically recommending suitable positions and poses in the scene of photography taken by amateurs. By analysing aesthetic‐aware features, the authors' strategy jointly takes attention and geometry composition into account to learn the aesthetic manifestation knowledge of professional photographers. Firstly, aesthetic composition representation exploits the strength of visual saliency to explicitly encode the spatial correlation of the professional photos. Secondly, ℓ2 regularised least square is adopted to constrain the representation coefficients, which provides a fast solution in selecting aesthetic candidates collaboratively. In addition, a novel confidence measure scheme is further designed based on reconstruction errors and the reference photos are updated adaptively according to the composition rules. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the model performs well for the portrait photographing recommendation.",

Recent research on image emotion analysis mainly focused on affective image classification, trying to find features that can classify emotions better. We concentrate on affective image retrieval and investigate the performance of different features on different kinds of images in a multi-graph learning framework. Firstly, we extract commonly used features of different levels for each image. Generic features and features derived from elements-of-art are extracted as low-level features. Attributes and interpretable principles-of-art based features are viewed as mid-level features, while semantic concepts described by adjective noun pairs and facial expressions are extracted as high-level features. Secondly, we construct single graph for each kind of feature to test the retrieval performance. Finally, we combine the multiple graphs together in a regularization framework to learn the optimized weights of each graph to efficiently explore the complementation of different features. Extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Emotions can be evoked in humans by images. Most previous works on image emotion analysis mainly used the elements-of-art-based low-level visual features. However, these features are vulnerable and not invariant to the different arrangements of elements. In this paper, we investigate the concept of principles-of-art and its influence on image emotions. Principles-of-art-based emotion features (PAEF) are extracted to classify and score image emotions for understanding the relationship between artistic principles and emotions. PAEF are the unified combination of representation features derived from different principles, including balance, emphasis, harmony, variety, gradation, and movement. Experiments on the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), a set of artistic photography and a set of peer rated abstract paintings, demonstrate the superiority of PAEF for affective image classification and regression (with about 5% improvement on classification accuracy and 0.2 decrease in mean squared error), as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We then utilize PAEF to analyze the emotions of master paintings, with promising results.",

      "abstract": "Playing appropriate music when watching images can make the images vivid and bring people into their intrinsic world. In this paper, we propose to musicalize images based on their emotions. Most of previous works on image emotion analysis mainly used elements-of-art based low-level visual features, which are vulnerable to the arrangements of elements. Here we propose to extract visual features, inspired by the concept of principles-of-art, to recognize image emotions. To enrich the descriptive power, a dimensional perspective is introduced to emotion modeling. Experiments on the IAPS dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods for emotion regression. The music in MST dataset with approximate emotions to the recognized image emotions is selected to musicalize these images. The user study results show its effectiveness and popularity of the image musicalization method.",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to index and recommend videos based on affective analysis, mainly on facial expression recognition of viewers. We first build a facial expression recognition classifier by embedding the process of building compositional Haar-like features into hidden conditional random fields (HCRFs). Then we extract viewers' facial expressions frame by frame through the videos, collected from the camera when viewers are watching videos, to obtain the affections of viewers. Finally, we draw the affective curve which tells the process of affection changes. Through the curve, we segment each video into affective sections, give the indexing result of the videos, and list recommendation points from views' aspect. Experiments on our collected database from the web show that the proposed method has a promising performance.",

And for temporal feature fusion, we adopt hidden dynamic conditional random fields (HDCRFs) based on HCRFs by introducing time dimension variable. Finally spatial features are embedded into HDCRFs to recognize facial expressions. Experiments on the well-known Cohn-Kanada database show that the proposed method has a promising recognition performance. And affective classification experimental results on our own videos show that most subjects are satisfied with the classification results.",

For comparison, data on condensation of instrument-grade and commercial-grade isobutane are also presented. The vapor was condensed on the outside of a horizontal instrumented tube with cooling water flowing inside the tube. The tube was fitted with thermocouples imbedded inside the wall of the tube to measure tube wall temperature at five equidistant stations along the length of the tube. The vapor temperature in the shell was measured using 17 thermocouples located at 150 mm intervals and spanning the five stations. Results for the data taken, based on the difference between vapor temperature and wall temperature, indicate lower condensation film coefficient when the mole fraction of isopentane is increased in the mixture. Mole-percent values of isopentane <50% would be expected to reverse this trend.",
