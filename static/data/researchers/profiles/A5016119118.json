A strong longitudinal trend emerges: evolving from foundational affective NLP (e.g., empathetic response generation) toward integrated, psychology-informed architectures (e.g., theory-of-mind benchmarking, tripartite feedback loops, social simulation), with increasing emphasis on rigorous evaluation, controllability, clinical validity, and neurodiverse inclusivity. The work consistently prioritizes interpretability, human-centered design, and closed-loop optimization in real-world therapeutic contexts.",

      "abstract": "While large language models show promise in mental healthcare, evaluating their therapeutic competence remains challenging due to the unstructured and longitudinal nature of counseling. We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.",

Existing evaluations are limited by the static assessment that focuses on knowledge tests, the single perspective that centers on user experience, and the open-loop framework that lacks actionable feedback. To address these issues, we propose Ψ-Arena, an interactive framework for comprehensive assessment and optimization of LLM-based counselors, featuring three key characteristics: (1) Realistic arena interactions that simulate real-world counseling through multi-stage dialogues with psychologically profiled NPC clients, (2) Tripartite evaluation that integrates assessments from the client, counselor, and supervisor perspectives, and (3) Closed-loop optimization that iteratively improves LLM counselors using diagnostic feedback. Experiments across eight state-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance variations in different real-world scenarios and evaluation perspectives. Moreover, reflection-based optimization results in up to a 141% improvement in counseling performance. We hope PsychoArena provides a foundational resource for advancing reliable and human-aligned LLM applications in mental healthcare.",

      "abstract": "Character-based dialogue (aka role-playing) enables users to freely customize characters for interaction, which often relies on LLMs, raising the need to evaluate LLMs’ character customization capability. However, existing benchmarks fail to ensure a robust evaluation as they often only involve a single character category or evaluate limited dimensions. Moreover, the sparsity of character features in responses makes feature-focused generative evaluation both ineffective and inefficient. To address these issues, we propose CharacterBench, the largest bilingual generative benchmark, with 22,859 human-annotated samples covering 3,956 characters from 25 detailed character categories. We define 11 dimensions of 6 aspects, classified as sparse and dense dimensions based on whether character features evaluated by specific dimensions manifest in each response. We enable effective and efficient evaluation by crafting tailored queries for each dimension to induce characters’ responses related to specific dimensions. Further, we develop CharacterJudge model for cost-effective and stable evaluations. Experiments show its superiority over SOTA automatic judges (e.g., GPT-4) and our benchmark’s potential to optimize LLMs’ character customization.",

      "abstract": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often misunderstand social situations and struggle to participate in daily routines. Social Stories™ are traditionally crafted by psychology experts under strict constraints to address these challenges but are costly and limited in diversity. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, there's an opportunity to develop more automated, affordable, and accessible methods to generate Social Stories in real-time with broad coverage. However, adapting LLMs to meet the unique and strict constraints of Social Stories is a challenging issue. To this end, we propose SS-GEN, a Social Story GENeration framework with LLMs. Firstly, we develop a constraint-driven sophisticated strategy named StarSow to hierarchically prompt LLMs to generate Social Stories at scale, followed by rigorous human filtering to build a high-quality dataset. Additionally, we introduce quality assessment criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of these generated stories. Considering that powerful closed-source large models require very complex instructions and expensive API fees, we finally fine-tune smaller language models with our curated high-quality dataset, achieving comparable results at lower costs and with simpler instruction and deployment. This work marks a significant step in leveraging AI to personalize Social Stories cost-effectively for autistic children at scale, which we hope can encourage future research on special groups.",

      "abstract": "Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data. We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible and practical.",

      "abstract": "Answering complex logical queries over knowledge graphs (KGs) is a fundamental yet challenging task. Recently, query representation has been a mainstream approach to complex logical reasoning, making the target answer and query closer in the embedding space. However, there are still two limitations. First, prior methods model the query as a fixed vector, but ignore the uncertainty of relations on KGs. In fact, different relations may contain different semantic distributions. Second, traditional representation frameworks fail to capture the joint distribution of queries and answers, which can be learned by generative models that have the potential to produce more coherent answers. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel generative model, named DiffCLR, which exploits the diffusion model for complex logical reasoning to approximate query distributions. Specifically, we first devise a query transformation to convert logical queries into input sequences by dynamically constructing contextual subgraphs. Then, we integrate them into the diffusion model to execute a multi-step generative process, and a structure-enhanced self-attention is further designed for incorporating the structural features embodied in KGs. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show our model effectively outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in multi-hop chain queries with significant improvement.",

      "abstract": "Empathy is a key ability for a human-like dialogue system. Inspired by social psychology, empathy includes both affective and cognitive aspects. Previous works on this topic have merely focused on recognizing emotions or modeling cognition with commonsense knowledge. Nevertheless, the generated results of these works still have a big gap with human-like empathetic responses. In this paper, we propose Seri, a SkEtching-Reasoning-Integrating framework for empathetic response generation. In particular, we define an empathy planner to capture and reason about multi-source information that considers cognition and affection. Further, we introduce a dynamic integrator module that allows the model dynamically select the appropriate information to generate empathetic responses. Experimental results on EmpatheticDialogue show that our method outperforms competitive baselines and generates responses with higher diversity and cognitive empathy levels.",

Though several methods have been proposed to generate empathetic responses, existing works often lead to monotonous empathy that refers to generic and safe expressions. In this paper, we propose to use explicit control to guide the empathy expression and design a framework DiffusEmp based on conditional diffusion language model to unify the utilization of dialogue context and attribute-oriented control signals. Specifically, communication mechanism, intent, and semantic frame are imported as multi-grained signals that control the empathy realization from coarse to fine levels. We then design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, and integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset EmpatheticDialogue show that our framework outperforms competitive baselines in terms of controllability, informativeness, and diversity without the loss of context-relatedness.",

      "abstract": "Controllable story generation is a challenging task in the field of NLP, which has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, most existing works generate a whole story conditioned on the appointed keywords or emotions, ignoring the psychological changes of the protagonist. Inspired by psychology theories, we introduce global psychological state chains, which include the needs and emotions of the protagonists, to help a story generation system create more controllable and well-planned stories. In this paper, we propose a Psychology-guIded Controllable Story Generation System (PICS) to generate stories that adhere to the given leading context and desired psychological state chains for the protagonist. Specifically, psychological state trackers are employed to memorize the protagonist's local psychological states to capture their inner temporal relationships. In addition, psychological state planners are adopted to gain the protagonist's global psychological states for story planning. Eventually, a psychology controller is designed to integrate the local and global psychological states into the story context representation for composing psychology-guided stories. Automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that PICS outperforms baselines, and each part of PICS shows effectiveness for writing stories with more consistent psychological changes.",

      "abstract": "Motivations, emotions, and actions are inter-related essential factors in human activities. While motivations and emotions have long been considered at the core of exploring how people take actions in human activities, there has been relatively little research supporting analyzing the relationship between human mental states and actions. We present the first study that investigates the viability of modeling motivations, emotions, and actions in language-based human activities, named COMMA (Cognitive Framework of Human Activities). Guided by COMMA, we define three natural language processing tasks (emotion understanding, motivation understanding and conditioned action generation), and build a challenging dataset Hail through automatically extracting samples from Story Commonsense. Experimental results on NLP applications prove the effectiveness of modeling the relationship. Furthermore, our models inspired by COMMA can better reveal the essential relationship among motivations, emotions and actions than existing methods.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn representations for entities and relations. Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a trained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r, t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works focus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us how to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited explanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt to study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability? For the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and from relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic Evidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important semantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods. For the problem 2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In SE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor pattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which contributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation. Finally, through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task and performs a better extrapolation ability.

There are many connections between daily news, for example, they may be different reports about the same event or the same person. However, previous works classify news mainly based on single news, they ignore relationships between multiple news. This paper innovatively utilizes relationships between multiple news, such as their relevance in time, place and people, to classify news. To take full advantage of these relationships and integrate various information of multiple news, we propose News Classification Graph (NCG), a heterogeneous graph with different types of nodes and edges. Furthermore, we propose Joint Heterogeneous graph Network (JHN) to properly embed the NCG. It fully utilizes the information of heterogeneous nodes and heterogeneous edges in NCG. Extensive experiments carried on four news datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our work in solving the news classification problem.",
