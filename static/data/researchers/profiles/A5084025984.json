    "trend_summary": "Shengping Zhang's research spans over two decades, evolving from foundational work in affective influences on behavior (e.g., finance, online personality) to cutting-edge, multimodal, real-time emotion-aware AI systems. A clear longitudinal trend emerges: integration of emotion modeling with perception (vision, audio, behavioral signals), generation (digital humans, animation), and application domains—especially clinical mental health support and robotics. Recent work emphasizes dynamic, adaptive, and real-time affective capabilities across modalities, reflecting a shift toward deployable, ethically grounded affective intelligence.",

However, current models still face three notable limitations: 1) an inability to discern varying levels of consistency between textual descriptions and multi-view images, 2) a deficiency in explicit fine-grained alignment between images and text, and 3) a lack of specific supervision mechanisms for facilitating global joint-embedding learning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual alignment-enhanced fashion VLP model. This model delves deeply into the rich resources of multi-view images and semantic attributes associated with each fashion item. Notably, we introduce two novel pretraining tasks: Multi-grained Adaptive Image-Text Alignment (MAITA) and Joint Embedding-oriented Alignment (JEA). MAITA focuses on optimizing the text/image encoder by orchestrating adaptive alignment between multi-view images and input text. This encompasses both coarse-grained and fine-grained alignment strategies to enrich semantic understanding, while JEA is devised to supervise the fine-grained semantic learning process of the global multimodal joint embedding. Experimental results spanning four diverse downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, text-guided image retrieval, category recognition, and subcategory recognition, substantiate the significant performance superiority of our model over prior state-of-the-art fashion VLP models.",

      "abstract": "Listening head generation aims to synthesize realistic and responsive non-verbal listener head motions that respond to speakers in conversational scenarios. Existing methods typically rely on fixed audio-visual input modalities and predefined emotion labels, limiting their adaptability and expressiveness in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time framework, REA-Listener, to generate high-fidelity listening head videos with flexible modality adaptation and dynamic emotion modeling. Specifically, we first propose a Modality-Adaptive Mixture of Experts (MA-MoE) module to encode arbitrary combinations of speaker audio and visual signals into a unified embedding space, ensuring robustness under partial modality conditions. To further enhance the temporal consistency of listener emotion, we present a lightweight emotional head dynamics generator with a multi-modal emotion predictor, which infers listener emotions dynamically from speaker context alongside head motion coefficient prediction. Finally, we employ a 3D-aware renderer based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to produce high-quality listener head videos in real time. With these components, our approach achieves efficient head motion generation at 30fps on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, supporting real-time interaction. Extensive evaluations and applications demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in listening head generation.",

It is designed to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically, our model is designed with three core goals: Video-level Sampling. We expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer video context from an near-global perspective. Video-level Association. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. Modality Scalable. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our UM-ODTrack achieves a new SOTA performance.",

      "abstract": "Pyrolysis is an important methodology for achieving efficient and clean utilization of coal. Lump coal pyrolysis demonstrates distinct advantages over pulverized coal processing, particularly in enhanced gas yield and superior coke quality. As a critical parameter in lump coal pyrolysis, particle size significantly influences heat transfer and mass transfer during pyrolysis, yet its governing mechanisms remain insufficiently explored. This research systematically investigates pyrolysis characteristics of the low-rank coal from Ordos, Inner Mongolia, across graded particle sizes (2–5 mm, 5–10 mm, 10–20 mm, and 20–30 mm) through pyrolysis experiments. Real-time central temperature monitoring of coal bed coupled with advanced characterization techniques—including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gas chromatography (GC), and GC–mass spectrometry (GC-MS)—reveals particle-size-dependent pyrolysis mechanisms. Key findings demonstrate that the larger particles enhance bed-scale convective heat transfer, accelerating temperature propagation from reactor walls to the coal center. However, excessive sizes cause significant intra-particle thermal gradients, impeding core pyrolysis. The 10–20 mm group emerges as optimal—balancing these effects to achieve uniform thermal attainment, evidenced by 20.99 vol% peak hydrogen yield and maximum char graphitization. Tar yield first demonstrates a tendency to rise and then decline, peaking at 14.66 wt.% for 5–10 mm particles. This behavior reflects competing mechanisms: enlarging particle size can improve bed permeability (reducing tar residence time and secondary reactions), but it can also inhibit volatile release and intensify thermal cracking of tar in oversized coal blocks. The BET analysis result reveals elevated specific surface area and pore volume with increasing particle size, except for the 10–20 mm group, showing abrupt porosity reduction—attributed to pore collapse caused by intense polycondensation reactions. Contrasting previous studies predominantly focused on less than 2 mm pulverized coal, this research selects large-size (from 2 mm to 30 mm) lump coal to clarify the effect of particle size on coal pyrolysis, providing critical guidance for industrial-scale lump coal pyrolysis optimization.",

      "abstract": "Numerous low-level vision tasks operate in the RAW domain due to its linear properties, bit depth, and sensor designs. Despite this, RAW image datasets are scarce and more expensive to collect than the already large and public sRGB datasets. For this reason, many approaches try to generate realistic RAW images using sensor information and sRGB images. This paper covers the second challenge on RAW Reconstruction from sRGB (Reverse ISP). We aim to recover RAW sensor images from smartphones given the corresponding sRGB images without metadata and, by doing this, “reverse” the ISP transformation. Over 150 participants joined this NTIRE 2025 challenge and submitted efficient models. The proposed methods and benchmark establish the state-of-the-art for generating realistic RAW data.",

The primary goal of the challenge is to design an event-based method that achieves high-quality image deblurring, with performance quantitatively assessed using Peak Signal-toNoise Ratio (PSNR). Notably, there are no restrictions on computational complexity or model size. The task focuses on leveraging both events and images as inputs for singleimage deblurring. A total of 199 participants registered, among whom 15 teams successfully submitted valid results, offering valuable insights into the current state of eventbased image deblurring. We anticipate that this challenge will drive further advancements in event-based vision research.",

      "abstract": "We propose GRGS, a generalizable and relightable 3D Gaussian framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis under diverse lighting conditions. Unlike existing methods that rely on per-character optimization or ignore physical constraints, GRGS adopts a feed-forward, fully supervised strategy projecting geometry, material, and illumination cues from multi-view 2D observations into 3D Gaussian representations. To recover accurate geometry under diverse lighting conditions, we introduce a Lighting-robust Geometry Refinement (LGR) module trained on synthetically relit data to predict precise depth and surface normals. Based on the high-quality geometry, a Physically Grounded Neural Rendering (PGNR) module is further proposed to integrate neural prediction with physics-based shading, supporting editable relighting with shadows and indirect illumination. Moreover, we design a 2D-to-3D projection training scheme leveraging differentiable supervision from ambient occlusion, direct, and indirect lighting maps, alleviating the computational cost of ray tracing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRGS achieves superior visual quality, geometric consistency, and generalization across characters and lighting conditions.",

Existing matting methods which have not explored scalable architectures or path-learning strategies, fail to tackle this challenge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Path-Adaptive Matting (PAM), a framework that dynamically adjusts network paths based on image contexts and computational cost constraints. We formulate the training of the computational cost-constrained matting network as a bilevel optimization problem, jointly optimizing the matting network and the path estimator. Building on this formalization, we design a path-adaptive matting architecture by incorporating path selection layers and learnable connect layers to estimate optimal paths and perform efficient inference within a unified network. Furthermore, we propose a performance-aware path-learning strategy to generate path labels online by evaluating a few paths sampled from the prior distribution of optimal paths and network estimations, enabling robust and efficient online path learning. Experiments on five image matting datasets demonstrate that the proposed PAM framework achieves competitive performance across a range of computational cost constraints.",

      "abstract": "3D panoptic scene understanding seeks to create novel view images with 3D-consistent panoptic segmentation, which is crucial for many vision and robotics applications. Mainstream methods (e.g., Panoptic Lifting) directly use machine-generated 2D panoptic segmentation masks as training labels. However, these generated masks often exhibit multi-view inconsistencies, leading to ambiguities during the optimization process. To address this, we present Multi-view Consistent 3D Panoptic Scene Understanding (MVC-PSU), featuring two key components: 1) Probabilistic Semantic Aligner, which associates semantic information of corresponding pixels across multiple views by probabilistic alignment to ensure that predicted panoptic segmentation masks are consistent across different views. 2) Geometric Consistency Enforcer, which uses multi-view projection and monocular depth consistency to ensure that the geometry of the reconstructed scene is accurate and consistent across different views. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MVC-PSU surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the ScanNet, Replica, and HyperSim datasets.",

      "abstract": "Most existing 3D visual speech animation methods synthesize lip movements synchronized with speech, which however neglect head poses and therefore degrade the animation realism. The animation of head poses presents two primary challenges: (1) the intricate mapping between speech and head poses remains poorly understood and (2) the absence of 4D face datasets featuring realistic head poses. Inspired by prosody decomposition in speech processing, we discern that head movements correlate with the fundamental frequency (F0) of speech prosody, while lip movements align with the language content. These observations motivate us to propose a novel framework, dubbed ProsodyTalker, that concurrently synthesizes lip and head movements, grounded in the principles of prosody decomposition. The core idea is first to adopt information perturbation to explicitly decompose the speech prosody into pose-related F0 and lip-related language content. Then, an autoregressive content-oriented fusion decoder is employed to enhance lip synchronization in the synthesized facial sequences. To synthesize head poses, we design a transformer-based variational autoencoder to learn a latent distribution of facial sequences and propose an F0-conditioned latent diffusion model to establish a probabilistic mapping from F0 to pose-related latent codes. Furthermore, we contribute a large-scale 4D face dataset containing bunches of variations in identities, head poses and facial motions. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves more realistic animation than state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Successful video deblurring relies on effectively using sharp pixels from other frames to recover the blurry pixels of the current frame. However, mainstream methods only use estimated optical flows to align and fuse features from adjacent frames without considering the pixel-wise blur levels, leading to the introduction of blurry pixels from adjacent frames. Furthermore, these methods fail to effectively exploit information from the entire input video. To address these limitations, we propose STDANet++, which redesigns the state-of-the-art method STDANet by introducing patch-based spatio-temporal deformable attention (PSTDA) module and long-term frame fusion (LTFF) module to the BiRNN-based structure. By effectively utilizing sharp information across the entire video, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro, DVD and BSD datasets, according to our experimental results.

      "abstract": "Differentiable rendering techniques have recently shown promising results for free-viewpoint video synthesis of characters. However, such methods, either Gaussian Splatting or neural implicit rendering, typically necessitate per-subject optimization which does not meet the requirement of real-time rendering in an interactive application. We propose a generalizable Gaussian Splatting approach for high-resolution image rendering under a sparse-view camera setting. To this end, we introduce Gaussian parameter maps defined on the source views and directly regress Gaussian properties for instant novel view synthesis without any fine-tuning or optimization. We train our Gaussian parameter regression module on human-only data or human-scene data, jointly with a depth estimation module to lift 2D parameter maps to 3D space. The proposed framework is fully differentiable with both depth and rendering supervision or with only rendering supervision. We further introduce a regularization term and an epipolar attention mechanism to preserve geometry consistency between two source views, especially when neglecting depth supervision. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while achieving an exceeding rendering speed.

      "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have significantly improved the performance of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) by adding noise to a mask and iteratively denoising it to match the target distributions. Due to the direct extraction of features from noisy masks and the lack of conditional constraints on a prediction area, the diffusion model may deviate from a correct prediction range and produces mispredictions in regions with high uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-guided diffusion model (UGDNet) for COD, which explicitly quantifies uncertainty and integrates it as an anchor condition into the diffusion models to provide an initialization of the diffusion regions. The core idea is first to utilize a probability representation and transformer to explicitly model uncertainty, aiming to identify areas where a model may generate overconfident mispredictions. Then, we use the uncertainty as an anchor condition to provide a reference prediction range for the diffusion model, guiding each step of the diffusion process. Furthermore, we use uncertainty to guide feature aggregation, prompting the model to pay extra attention to the semantic features of regions with high uncertainty to refine the segmentation results further. The experimental results indicate that our proposed UGDNet achieves higher accuracy than existing state-of-the-art models on five COD benchmarks, including COD10K, NC4K, CAMO, CHAMELEON, and CDS2K.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the digital signal modulation recognition in non-cooperative situations is significant research area. The existing recognition methods are complex to meet the requirement of its performance which leads to reduce the recognition rate. This research proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Ensemble Machine Learning (ML) approach for digital signal modulation recognition. The ensemble ML includes Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Ensemble models provide solutions for most sophisticated and noisy signal environments since different learners are able to respond to the changes in SNR and modulation type. This approach leads to higher recognition accuracy, particularly in complex situations which makes ensemble ML is reliable and effective for digital signal modulation recognition. The ACO has an ability of generating a diverse number of solutions within a short period due to probabilistic decision making which ensures getting near-optimal solutions for feature selection and classification in modulation recognition. Also, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is used to extract features and provide multiple resolutions allowing one to detect high-frequency components and low frequency components. The ensemble ML achieved overall recognition rate of 0.96, 0.95 and 0.99 for Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and 8 Phase Shift Keying (8PSK) respectively.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Face reshaping aims to adjust the shape of a face in a portrait image to make the face aesthetically beautiful, which has many potential applications. Existing methods 1) operate on the pre-defined facial landmarks, leading to artifacts and distortions due to the limited number of landmarks, 2) synthesize new faces based on segmentation masks or sketches, causing generated faces to look dissatisfied due to the losses of skin details and difficulties in dealing with hair and background blurring, and 3) project the positions of the deformed feature points from the 3D face model to the 2D image, making the results unrealistic because of the misalignment between feature points. In this paper, we propose a novel method named face shape transfer (FST) via semantic warping, which can transfer both the overall face and individual components (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth) of a reference image to the source image. To achieve controllability at the component level, we introduce five encoding networks, which are designed to learn feature embedding specific to different face components. To effectively exploit the features obtained from semantic parsing maps at different scales, we employ a straightforward method of directly connecting all layers within the global dense network. This direct connection facilitates maximum information flow between layers, efficiently utilizing diverse scale semantic parsing information. To avoid deformation artifacts, we introduce a spatial transformer network, allowing the network to handle different types of semantic warping effectively. To facilitate extensive evaluation, we construct a large-scale high-resolution face dataset, which contains 14,000 images with a resolution of 1024 × 1024. Superior performance of our method is demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative experiments on the benchmark dataset.",

      "abstract": "The ability to animate photo-realistic head avatars reconstructed from monocular portrait video sequences represents a crucial step in bridging the gap between the virtual and real worlds. Recent advancements in head avatar techniques, including explicit 3D morphable meshes (3DMM), point clouds, and neural implicit representation have been exploited for this ongoing research. However, 3DMM-based methods are constrained by their fixed topologies, point-based approaches suffer from a heavy training burden due to the extensive quantity of points involved, and the last ones suffer from limitations in deformation flexibility and rendering efficiency. In response to these challenges, we propose MonoGaussianAvatar (Monocular Gaussian Point-based Head Avatar), a novel approach that harnesses 3D Gaussian point representation coupled with a Gaussian deformation field to learn explicit head avatars from monocular portrait videos. We define our head avatars with Gaussian points characterized by adaptable shapes, enabling flexible topology. These points exhibit movement with a Gaussian deformation field in alignment with the target pose and expression of a person, facilitating efficient deformation. Additionally, the Gaussian points have controllable shape, size, color, and opacity combined with Gaussian splatting, allowing for efficient training and rendering. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art results among previous methods.

Compared to previous systems, Tele-Aloha utilizes only four sparse RGB cameras, one consumer-grade GPU, and one autostereoscopic screen to achieve high-resolution (2048x2048), real-time (30 fps), low-latency (less than 150ms) and robust distant communication. As the core of Tele-Aloha, we propose an efficient novel view synthesis algorithm for upper-body. Firstly, we design a cascaded disparity estimator for obtaining a robust geometry cue. Additionally a neural rasterizer via Gaussian Splatting is introduced to project latent features onto target view and to decode them into a reduced resolution. Further, given the high-quality captured data, we leverage weighted blending mechanism to refine the decoded image into the final resolution of 2K. Exploiting world-leading autostereoscopic display and low-latency iris tracking, users are able to experience a strong three-dimensional sense even without any wearable head-mounted display device. Altogether, our telepresence system demonstrates the sense of co-presence in real-life experiments, inspiring the next generation of communication.",

      "abstract": "We present GaussianAvatar, an efficient approach to cre-ating realistic human avatars with dynamic 3D appear-ances from a single video. We start by introducing animat-able 3D Gaussians to explicitly represent humans in var-ious poses and clothing styles. Such an explicit and ani-matable representation can fuse 3D appearances more effi-ciently and consistently from 2D observations. Our repre-sentation is further augmented with dynamic properties to support pose-dependent appearance modeling, where a dy-namic appearance network along with an optimizable feature tensor is designed to learn the motion-to-appearance mapping. Moreover, by leveraging the differentiable motion condition, our method enables a joint optimization of motions and appearances during avatar modeling, which helps to tackle the long-standing issue of inaccurate motion esti-mation in monocular settings. The efficacy of GaussianA-vatar is validated on both the public dataset and our col-lected dataset, demonstrating its superior performances in terms of appearance quality and rendering efficiency. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/aipixel/GaussianAvatar.",

The proposed method enables 2K-resolution rendering under a sparse-view camera setting. Unlike the original Gaussian Splatting or neural implicit rendering methods that necessitate per-subject optimizations, we introduce Gaussian parameter maps defined on the source views and regress directly Gaussian Splatting properties for instant novel view synthesis without any fine-tuning or optimization. To this end, we train our Gaussian parameter regression module on a large amount of human scan data, jointly with a depth estimation module to lift 2D parameter maps to 3D space. The proposed framework is fully differentiable and experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while achieving an exceeding rendering speed.

      "abstract": "The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQA-Track), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOT<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</inf>, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.

      "abstract": "Existing joint low-light enhancement and deblurring methods learn pixel-wise mappings from paired synthetic data, which results in limited generalization in real-world scenes. While some studies explore the rich generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on the assumed degradation process and cannot handle unknown real-world degradations well. To address these problems, we propose a novel zero-shot framework, FourierDiff, which embeds Fourier priors into a pre-trained diffusion model to harmoniously handle the joint degradation of luminance and structures. FourierDiff is appealing in its relaxed requirements on paired training data and degradation assumptions. The key zero-shot insight is motivated by image characteristics in the Fourier domain: most luminance information concentrates on amplitudes while structure and content information are closely related to phases. Based on this observation, we decompose the sampled results of the reverse diffusion process in the Fourier domain and take advantage of the amplitude of the generative prior to align the enhanced brightness with the distribution of natural images. To yield a sharp and content-consistent enhanced result, we further design a spatial-frequency alternating optimization strategy to progressively refine the phase of the input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in real-world scenes. The code is available at https://github.com/aipixel/FourierDiff.",

      "abstract": "Existing diffusion models for pose-guided human video generation mostly suffer from temporal inconsistency in the generated appearance and poses due to the inherent randomization nature of the generation process. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DiffPerformer, to synthesize high-fidelity and temporally consistent human video. Without complex architecture modification or costly training, DiffPerformer finetunes a pre-trained diffusion model on a single video of the target character and introduces an implicit video representation as a proxy to learn temporally consistent guidance for the diffusion model. The guidance is encoded into VAE latent space and an iterative optimization loop is constructed between the implicit video representation and the diffusion model, allowing to harness the smooth property of the implicit video representation and the generative capabilities of the diffusion model in a mutually beneficial way. Moreover, we propose 3D-aware human flow as a temporal constraint during the optimization to explicitly model the correspondence between driving poses and human appearance. This alleviates the mis-alignment between driving poses and target performer and therefore maintains the appearance coherence under various motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/aipixel/DiffPerformer.",

      "abstract": "The intersection of physics-based vision and deep learning presents an exciting frontier for advancing computer vision technologies. By leveraging the principles of physics to inform and enhance deep learning models, we can develop more robust and accurate vision systems. Physics-based vision aims to invert the processes to recover scene properties such as shape, reflectance, light distribution, and medium properties from images. In recent years, deep learning has shown promising improvements for various vision tasks, and when combined with physics-based vision, these approaches can enhance the robustness and accuracy of vision systems. This technical report summarizes the outcomes of the Physics-Based Vision Meets Deep Learning (PBDL) 2024 challenge, held in CVPR 2024 workshop. The challenge consisted of eight tracks, focusing on Low-Light Enhancement and Detection as well as High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging. This report details the objectives, methodologies, and results of each track, highlighting the top-performing solutions and their innovative approaches.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a low-budget and high-authenticity bidirectional telepresence system, Tele-Aloha, targeting peer-to-peer communication scenarios. Compared to previous systems, Tele-Aloha utilizes only four sparse RGB cameras, one consumer-grade GPU, and one autostereoscopic screen to achieve high-resolution (2048x2048), real-time (30 fps), low-latency (less than 150ms) and robust distant communication. As the core of Tele-Aloha, we propose an efficient novel view synthesis algorithm for upper-body. Firstly, we design a cascaded disparity estimator for obtaining a robust geometry cue. Additionally a neural rasterizer via Gaussian Splatting is introduced to project latent features onto target view and to decode them into a reduced resolution. Further, given the high-quality captured data, we leverage weighted blending mechanism to refine the decoded image into the final resolution of 2K. Exploiting world-leading autostereoscopic display and low-latency iris tracking, users are able to experience a strong three-dimensional sense even without any wearable head-mounted display device. Altogether, our telepresence system demonstrates the sense of co-presence in real-life experiments, inspiring the next generation of communication.",

      "abstract": "Recently, RGB-T tracking methods have made significant progress, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in addressing the complexities of tracking tasks within demanding environments. However, these methods overlook instability of modal validity in real-world scenarios. This limits the model’s ability to understand the correlation between modalities, thereby hindering the model’s ability to fully leverage the synergistic effects of RGB and TIR. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RGB-T tracking model named MCTrack, from the perspective of leveraging correlation among modalities. First, during the feature extraction stage, we design a novel module based on channel matching modeling to construct bidirectional channel context information flow for two modalities. By leveraging information flow, specific modalities correlation information can be transmitted to two modes, augmenting the correlation between the two modes adaptively. Subsequently, after the feature extraction network, the features of each modality are decoded and transformed to generate more correlated feature representations. During this stage, we extract distinctive and collective features by leveraging the correlation among modalities. Then fusing these features and generated search region features specifically for localization. This aids the model in comprehending the correlation between RGB and TIR under complex scenarios, thereby enhancing its ability to capture and utilize key features. Based on extensive experiments conducted on four popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks, our model demonstrates superior performance, particularly showcasing impressive results on the LasHeR dataset with an achieved Precision of 71.6%.",

      "abstract": "How to effectively exploit spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture target appearance changes in visual tracking. However, most deep learning-based trackers mainly focus on designing a complicated appearance model or template updating strategy, while lacking the exploitation of context between consecutive frames and thus entailing the when-and-how-to-update dilemma. To address these issues, we propose a novel explicit visual prompts framework for visual tracking, dubbed EVPTrack. Specifically, we utilize spatio-temporal tokens to propagate information between consecutive frames without focusing on updating templates. As a result, we cannot only alleviate the challenge of when-to-update, but also avoid the hyper-parameters associated with updating strategies. Then, we utilize the spatio-temporal tokens to generate explicit visual prompts that facilitate inference in the current frame. The prompts are fed into a transformer encoder together with the image tokens without additional processing. Consequently, the efficiency of our model is improved by avoiding how-to-update. In addition, we consider multi-scale information as explicit visual prompts, providing multiscale template features to enhance the EVPTrack's ability to handle target scale changes. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks (i.e., LaSOT, LaSOText, GOT-10k, UAV123, TrackingNet, and TNL2K.) validate that our EVPTrack can achieve competitive performance at a real-time speed by effectively exploiting both spatio-temporal and multi-scale information. Code and models are available at https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/EVPTrack.",

      "abstract": "Online contextual reasoning and association across consecutive video frames are critical to perceive instances in visual tracking. However, most current top-performing trackers persistently lean on sparse temporal relationships between reference and search frames via an offline mode. Consequently, they can only interact independently within each image-pair and establish limited temporal correlations. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a simple, flexible and effective video-level tracking pipeline, named ODTrack, which densely associates the contextual relationships of video frames in an online token propagation manner. ODTrack receives video frames of arbitrary length to capture the spatio-temporal trajectory relationships of an instance, and compresses the discrimination features (localization information) of a target into a token sequence to achieve frame-to-frame association. This new solution brings the following benefits: 1) the purified token sequences can serve as prompts for the inference in the next video frame, whereby past information is leveraged to guide future inference; 2) the complex online update strategies are effectively avoided by the iterative propagation of token sequences, and thus we can achieve more efficient model representation and computation. ODTrack achieves a new SOTA performance on seven benchmarks, while running at real-time speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack.",

We modify the classical spectral rendering into two main steps, 1) the generation of a series of spectrum maps spanning different wavelengths, 2) the combination of these spectrum maps for the RGB output. Our SpectralNeRF follows these two steps through the proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture (SpectralMLP) and Spectrum Attention UNet (SAUNet). Given the ray origin and the ray direction, the SpectralMLP constructs the spectral radiance field to obtain spectrum maps of novel views, which are then sent to the SAUNet to produce RGB images of white-light illumination. Applying NeRF to build up the spectral rendering is a more physically-based way from the perspective of ray-tracing. Further, the spectral radiance fields decompose difficult scenes and improve the performance of NeRF-based methods. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed SpectralNeRF is superior to recent NeRF-based methods when synthesizing new views on synthetic and real datasets. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/liru0126/SpectralNeRF.",

      "abstract": "The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The composite interlamination is the key part of load transfer and plays a decisive role in the overall mechanical performance of composite structures. The interlaminar property is predominantly influenced by the matrix resin which is easily affected by the hygrothermal environment. This paper delved into the effect of hygrothermal aging duration on the interlayer debonding behavior of unidirectional (UD) laminates. The pre‐cracked specimens were treated by hygrothermal aging with a period of 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. The double cantilever beam (DCB) tests were employed to evaluate the interlaminar property. The effect of hygrothermal aging on load–displacement responses, R ‐curves, crack growth speed, and fracture surface topography was analyzed. The results revealed that the load‐bearing capacity of aged specimens presented a reduction of 18.6%–29.0% compared with unaged ones. The interlaminar fracture toughness of specimens subjected to 15 days of treatment decreased significantly compared with that of unaged specimens due to the increase of water absorption caused by hygrothermal aging. With the increase in hygrothermal aging time, the interlaminar fracture toughness peaked at 60 days because of the post‐curing effect, followed by a declining trend influenced by the dominant hygrothermal aging effect. The fiber bridging of aged samples was increasingly obvious, became the most prominent at 60 days, and then gradually reduced. The fiber bridging diminished the crack propagation speed, hindered interlaminar debonding, and contributed to the interlaminar toughening. Highlights The samples underwent hygrothermal aging for 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Load ability of aged samples was at least 18.6% lower than that of unaged ones. R ‐curves rose before the crack length of 79 mm and then tended to stabilize. Fracture toughness first decreased, then increased and reduced with aging time. Fiber bridging could hinder crack growth and improve the interlayer property.",

Stereo images with unlimited parallax (e.g., large ranges and asymmetrical types) are more challenging in real-world applications and have rarely been explored so far. To restore high-quality stereo images with unlimited parallax, this paper proposes an attention-guided correspondence learning method, which learns both self- and cross-views feature correspondence guided by parallax and omnidirectional attention. To learn cross-view feature correspondence, a Selective Parallax Attention Module (SPAM) is proposed to interact with cross-view features under the guidance of parallax attention that adaptively selects receptive fields for different parallax ranges. Furthermore, to handle asymmetrical parallax, we propose a Non-local Omnidirectional Attention Module (NOAM) to learn the non-local correlation of both self- and cross-view contexts, which guides the aggregation of global contextual features. Finally, we propose an Attention-guided Correspondence Learning Restoration Network (ACLRNet) upon SPAMs and NOAMs to restore stereo images by associating the features of two views based on the learned correspondence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method on three stereo image restoration tasks including super-resolution, denoising, and compression artifact reduction.",

      "abstract": "Existing human matting methods are incapable of accurately estimating the alpha mattes of arbitrarily selected humans from a group photo. An alternative solution is to apply them to the corresponding cropped image patches. However, this option obtains an inaccurate alpha estimation due to the interference of the body parts of the neighboring humans. In addition, these methods are only trained on finely annotated synthetic data, which causes poor performance in real-world scenarios due to the domain shift. To address these problems, we propose human selective matting (HSMatt), which performs matting for arbitrarily selected humans from a group photo given only a simple bounding box as guidance. Specifically, we design a global–local context network to extract both local and global semantic context features. A human-aware trimap network is then proposed to generate human-aware trimaps for the selected humans, which adopts stacked bidirectional inference modules with intermediate supervision to progressively refine the estimated trimap. Finally, a partially supervised matting network is introduced to estimate the alpha matte, which uses a sample-varying loss to train the network on both the finely annotated synthetic data and coarsely annotated real-world data, resulting in high accuracy and good generalization. To evaluate the proposed HSMatt, we construct the first human selective matting dataset, named HSM-200K, which contains over 200,000 human images with instance-level alpha matte annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HSMatt outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face to a target face image while preserving the target attributes (e.g., facial expression, head pose, illumination, and background). Most existing methods use a face recognition model to extract global features from the source face and directly fuse them with the target to generate a swapping result. However, identity-irrelevant attributes (e.g., hairstyle and facial appearances) contribute a lot to the recognition task, and thus swapping this task-specific feature inevitably interfuses source attributes with target ones. In this paper, we propose an identity-aware variational autoencoder (ID-VAE) based face swapping framework, dubbed VAFSwap, which learns disentangled identity and attribute representations for high-fidelity face swapping. In particular, we overcome the unpaired training barrier of VAE and impose a proxy identity on the latent space by exploiting the weak supervision from an auxiliary image set whose identity is averaged from multiple collected face images. To explicitly guide the identity fusion, we further devise an identity-associated matrix that corresponds different face regions with their identity representations to perform identity-related feature interactions. Finally, we incorporate spatial dimensions into the latent space and exploit the generative priors of a pre-trained face generator, allowing the effective elimination of noticeable swapping artifacts. Extensive experiments on the FaceForensics++ and CelebA-HQ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.",

      "abstract": "Blind Face Super-Resolution (BFSR) has recently gained widespread attention, which aims to super-resolve Low-Resolution (LR) face images with complex unknown degradation to High-Resolution (HR) face images. However, existing BFSR methods suffer from two major limitations. First, most of them are trained on synthetic degradation data pairs with pre-defined degradation models, which leads to poor performance due to the degradation mismatch between other unknown complex degradations in real-world scenarios. Second, some methods rely on hand-crafted face priors as constraints, such as facial landmarks and parsing maps, which require additional callouts and laborious hyperparameter tuning for real cases. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple and effective self-supervised cooperative learning framework via a conditional diffusion contraction method for BFSR, dubbed DifBFSR, which establishes the posterior distribution of HR images from degraded LR images with unknown degradation via a powerful diffusion model without expensive supervised training or additional constraint design. Specifically, we first transform the degraded LR face image to an intermediate HR face prediction with degradation-invariant by a simple Super-Resolution module (SRM), which only relies on self-supervised optimization. To enhance the face prediction, we propose a Contraction Filter Module (CFM) to gradually contract the restoration error by adaptive dynamic filtering, which efficiently leverages rich nature face prior encapsulated in the pre-trained diffusion model through conditional posterior sampling. Finally, by combining the SRM, CFM, and diffusion model in a self-supervised cooperative learning framework, DifBFSR can robustly handle unknown complex degradations, which favorably avoids the cumbersome training and parameter tuning. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on complex degraded synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art BFSR methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes the DiffuGesture entry to the GENEA Challenge 2023. In this paper, we utilize conditional diffusion models to formulate the gesture generation problem. The DiffuGesture system generates human-like gestures from the two-person dialogue scenario, which are responsive to the interlocutor motions and accompany with the input speech. DiffuGesture system is built upon the recent DiffGesture [39]. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight transformer encoder to fuse the temporal relationships between human gestures and multi-modal conditions. Moreover, we adopt implicit classifier-free guidance to trade off between diversity and gesture quality. According to the collective evaluation released by GENEA Challenge 2023, our system demonstrates strong competitiveness in the appropriateness evaluation.",

      "abstract": "We present CaPhy, a novel method for reconstructing animatable human avatars with realistic dynamic properties for clothing. Specifically, we aim for capturing the geometric and physical properties of the clothing from real observations. This allows us to apply novel poses to the human avatar with physically correct deformations and wrinkles of the clothing. To this end, we combine unsupervised training with physics-based losses and 3D-supervised training using scanned data to reconstruct a dynamic model of clothing that is physically realistic and conforms to the human scans. We also optimize the physical parameters of the underlying physical model from the scans by introducing gradient constraints of the physics-based losses. In contrast to previous work on 3D avatar reconstruction, our method is able to generalize to novel poses with realistic dynamic cloth deformations. Experiments on several subjects demonstrate that our method can estimate the physical properties of the garments, resulting in superior quantitative and qualitative results compared with previous methods.",

      "abstract": "Existing makeup transfer methods typically transfer simple makeup colors in a well-conditioned face image and fail to handle makeup style details (e.g., complicated colors and shapes) and facial occlusion. To address these problems, this paper proposes Hybrid Transformers with Attention-guided Spatial Embeddings (named HT-ASE) for makeup transfer and removal. Specifically, a makeup context extractor adopts makeup context global-local interactions to aggregate the high-level context and low-level detail features of the makeup styles, which obtains the context-aware makeup features that encode the complicated colors and shapes of the makeup styles. A face identity extractor adopts a face identity local interaction to aggregate the identity-relevant features of shallow layers into identity semantic features, which refines the identity features. A spatially similarity-aware fusion network introduces a spatially-adaptive layer-instance normalization with attention-guided spatial embeddings to perform semantic alignment and fusion between the makeup and identity features, yielding precise and robust transfer results even with large spatial misalignment and facial occlusion. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially in the preservation of makeup style details and handling facial occlusion.",

      "abstract": "Image stitching aims to combine two images with overlapping fields to expand the field-of-view (FoV). However, the stitched images of existing methods are irregular, and need to be processed by rectangling methods, which is time-consuming and prone to be unnatural. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end framework, Rectangular-output Deep Image Stitching Network (RDISNet), to directly stitch two images into a standard rectangular image while learning color consistency between image pairs and maintaining the authenticity of the content. To further preserve the structure of large objects in the stitched image, we design a dilated BN-RCU block to expand the receptive field of RDISNet for extracting enriched spatial context. Furthermore, we design a novel data synthesis pipeline and build the first rectangular-output deep image stitching dataset (RDIS-D) for jointing image stitching and rectangling. Experimental results demonstrate that RDISNet performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Human instance matting aims to estimate an alpha matte for each human\\ninstance in an image, which is extremely challenging and has rarely been\\nstudied so far. Despite some efforts to use instance segmentation to generate a\\ntrimap for each instance and apply trimap-based matting methods, the resulting\\nalpha mattes are often inaccurate due to inaccurate segmentation. In addition,\\nthis approach is computationally inefficient due to multiple executions of the\\nmatting method. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel\\nEnd-to-End Human Instance Matting (E2E-HIM) framework for simultaneous multiple\\ninstance matting in a more efficient manner. Specifically, a general perception\\nnetwork first extracts image features and decodes instance contexts into latent\\ncodes. Then, a united guidance network exploits spatial attention and semantics\\nembedding to generate united semantics guidance, which encodes the locations\\nand semantic correspondences of all instances. Finally, an instance matting\\nnetwork decodes the image features and united semantics guidance to predict all\\ninstance-level alpha mattes. In addition, we construct a large-scale human\\ninstance matting dataset (HIM-100K) comprising over 100,000 human images with\\ninstance alpha matte labels. Experiments on HIM-100K demonstrate the proposed\\nE2E-HIM outperforms the existing methods on human instance matting with 50%\\nlower errors and 5X faster speed (6 instances in a 640X640 image). Experiments\\non the PPM-100, RWP-636, and P3M datasets demonstrate that E2E-HIM also\\nachieves competitive performance on traditional human matting.\\n",

      "abstract": "Deep learning-based image compressive sensing (CS) methods have achieved great success in the past few years. However, most of them are content-independent, with a spatially uniform sampling rate allocation for the entire image. Such practises may potentially degrade the performance of image CS with block-based sampling, since the content of different blocks in an image is different. In this article, we propose a novel rate-adaptive image CS neural network (dubbed RACSNet) to achieve adaptive sampling rate allocation based on the content characteristics of the image with a single model. Specifically, a measurement domain-based reconstruction distortion is first used to guide the sampling rate allocation for different blocks in an image without access to the ground truth image. Then, a step-wise training strategy is designed to train a reusable sampling matrix, which is capable of sampling image blocks to generate the compressed measurements under arbitrary sampling rates. Subsequently, a pyramid-shaped initial reconstruction sub-network and a hierarchical deep reconstruction sub-network that fuse the measurement information of different scales are put forward to reconstruct image blocks from the compressed measurements. Finally, a reconstruction distortion map and an improved loss function are developed to eliminate the blocking artifacts and further enhance the CS reconstruction. Experimental results on both objective metrics and subjective visual qualities show that the proposed RACSNet achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "We propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based architecture for achieving high-quality physically based rendering (PBR). Conventional PBR relies heavily on ray tracing, which is computationally expensive in complicated environments. Some recent deep learning-based methods can improve efficiency but cannot deal with illumination variation well. In this paper, we propose PBR-GAN, an end-to-end GAN-based network that solves these problems while generating natural photo-realistic images. Two encoders (the shading encoder and albedo encoder) and two decoders (the image decoder and light decoder) are introduced to achieve our target. The two encoders and the image decoder constitute the generator that learns the mapping between the generated domain and the real domain. The light decoder produces light maps that pay more attention to the highlight and shadow regions. The discriminator aims to optimize the generator by distinguishing target images from the generated ones. Three novel loss items, concentrating on domain translation, overall shading preservation, and light map estimation, are proposed to optimize the photo-realistic outputs. Furthermore, a real dataset is collected to provide realistic information for training GAN architecture. Extensive experiments indicate that PBR-GAN can preserve the illumination variation and improve the image perceptual quality.",

      "abstract": "Most of the existing bounding box-based trackers rely on a classification subnetwork and a regression subnetwork to predict the location and scale of the bounding box. They learn the classification subnetwork by processing each sample individually and applying the suggested classification confidence to produce the final prediction. They typically involve heuristic positive sample configurations, which inevitably introduce mislabelled training samples and therefore deteriorate their tracking performance. Moreover, the parallel prediction of the bounding box position and scale may lead to misalignment of classification and regression. To address these issues,we propose a simple yet effective soft constraint-based tracking framework without positive samples (named SoftCT). SoftCT adaptively senses the target's pixel position through a soft constraint mechanism, which eliminates potential performance gaps caused by artificially marking the target's pixel position. In addition, SoftCT computes the state of the bounding box by aggregating such positional information, thereby allowing the tracker to avoid misalignment in classification and regression due to uninformed communication. Specifically, SoftCT directly senses the position of the target pixel and fuses this information into the bounding box prediction, rather than requiring explicit annotation or regression of the target pixel. Extensive experiments on six tracking benchmarks including GOT-10k, TrackingNet, LaSOT, UAV123, LaSOText and TNL2K demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Learning-based approaches to monocular motion capture have recently shown promising results by learning to regress in a data-driven manner. However, due to the challenges in data collection and network designs, it remains challenging for existing solutions to achieve real-time full-body capture while being accurate in world space. In this work, we introduce ProxyCap, a human-centric proxy-to-motion learning scheme to learn world-space motions from a proxy dataset of 2D skeleton sequences and 3D rotational motions. Such proxy data enables us to build a learning-based network with accurate world-space supervision while also mitigating the generalization issues. For more accurate and physically plausible predictions in world space, our network is designed to learn human motions from a human-centric perspective, which enables the understanding of the same motion captured with different camera trajectories. Moreover, a contact-aware neural motion descent module is proposed in our network so that it can be aware of foot-ground contact and motion misalignment with the proxy observations. With the proposed learning-based solution, we demonstrate the first real-time monocular full-body capture system with plausible foot-ground contact in world space even using hand-held moving cameras.

      "abstract": "Transformer has achieved impressive progress in visual tracking due to their capability of global modeling, which enables them to learn low-frequency features(i.e., high-level semantic information). However, it seems to overlook the high-frequency features(i.e., low-level texture and edge information) which are crucial to identify different intra-class object instances in the tracking task. To address this issue, we propose a transformer based tracker via frequency fusion perspective that investigated whether high-frequency and low-frequency features can be effectively combined to achieve robust tracking. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective two-stage fusion strategy and use an appropriate frequency fusion strategy in tracking process of each stage so as to make full use of frequency domain information. In the feature extraction stage, we use wavelet decomposition of high-frequency subbands to solve the performance loss caused by the transformer's catastrophic forgetting of high-frequency information. In the prediction head stage, we use a variety of wavelet decomposition subbands to model the multi-frequency information. The two-stage fusion strategy makes our model extract more balanced and beneficial multi-frequency information, enabling it to effectively capture target texture information and local edge information while also being sensitive to global information. Extensive experiments on six challenging benchmarks (i.e., LaSOT <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{ext}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> , UAV123, TNL2K, LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k) demonstrates the superior performance of our tracker.",

      "abstract": "Image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer an in-shop clothing image to a person image. Most existing methods adopt a single global deformation to perform clothing warping directly, which lacks fine-grained modeling of in-shop clothing and leads to distorted clothing appearance. In addition, existing methods usually fail to generate limb details well because they are limited by the used clothing-agnostic person representation without referring to the limb textures of the person image. To address these problems, we propose Limb-aware Virtual Try-on Network named PL-VTON, which performs fine-grained clothing warping progressively and generates high-quality try-on results with realistic limb details. Specifically, we present Progressive Clothing Warping (PCW) that explicitly models the location and size of in-shop clothing and utilizes a two-stage alignment strategy to progressively align the in-shop clothing with the human body. Moreover, a novel gravity-aware loss that considers the fit of the person wearing clothing is adopted to better handle the clothing edges. Then, we design Person Parsing Estimator (PPE) with a non-limb target parsing map to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and body regions. Finally, we introduce Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) that focuses on generating realistic details in limb regions, where a coarse try-on result is first generated by fusing the warped clothing image with the person image, then limb textures are further fused with the coarse result under limb-aware guidance to refine limb details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PL-VTON outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

      "abstract": "Coal gasification is recognized as the core technology of clean coal utilization that exhibits significant advantages in hydrogen-rich syngas production and CO2 emission reduction. This review briefly discusses the recent research progress on various coal gasification techniques, including conventional coal gasification (fixed bed, fluidized bed, and entrained bed gasification) and relatively new coal gasification (supercritical water gasification, plasma gasification, chemical-looping gasification, and decoupling gasification) in terms of their gasifiers, process parameters (such as coal type, temperature, pressure, gasification agents, catalysts, etc.), advantages, and challenges. The capacity and potential of hydrogen production through different coal gasification technologies are also systematically analyzed. In this regard, the decoupling gasification technology based on pyrolysis, coal char–CO2 gasification, and CO shift reaction shows remarkable features in improving comprehensive utilization of coal, low-energy capture and conversion of CO2, as well as efficient hydrogen production. As the key unit of decoupling gasification, this work also reviews recent research advances (2019–2023) in coal char–CO2 gasification, the influence of different factors such as coal type, gasification agent composition, temperature, pressure, particle size, and catalyst on the char–CO2 gasification performance are studied, and its reaction kinetics are also outlined. This review serves as guidance for further excavating the potential of gasification technology in promoting clean fuel production and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "abstract": "Both the discrete motion states and continuous joint kinematics are essential for controlling assistive robots under changeable environmental conditions. However, few studies investigate both the discrete and continuous motion intents. This article is the first work to propose an end-to-end motion intent decoding method that integrates recognition of discrete locomotion modes and prediction of continuous joint kinematics and gait events. First, we propose a data-driven approach to segment the transitional periods of the adjacent locomotion modes and determine their boundaries. Second, we build a convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) network that utilizes locomotion mode classification as the prior of joint kinematics and gait event prediction and thus decodes discrete and continuous motion intents. Finally, we evaluate our method through extensive experiments and comparisons. The proposed method for locomotion mode recognition achieves an accuracy of 98.73% for steady state and 97.53% for transitional periods. For knee angle prediction, the method achieves the ahead-of-time prediction with normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) lower than 8.41%, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${R}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> -value higher than 0.93, and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${R}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> -square higher than 0.88 for various prediction times. For gait event prediction, it predicts the future timing of events with an error of 8.46 ms for initial contact, 32.76 ms for heel off, and 8.91 ms for toe off. This study reveals the feasibility of predicting locomotion-based kinematics and gait events on various terrains. The rich motion intents studied in this work highlight the potential of a more detailed lower limb rehabilitation system.",

      "abstract": "Traditional studies emphasize the significance of context information in improving matting performance. Consequently, deep learning-based matting methods delve into designing pooling or affinity-based context aggregation modules to achieve superior results. However, these modules cannot well handle the context scale shift caused by the difference in image size during training and inference, resulting in matting performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit the context aggregation mechanisms of matting networks and find that a basic encoder-decoder network without any context aggregation modules can actually learn more universal context aggregation, thereby achieving higher matting performance compared to existing methods. Building on this insight, we present AEMatter, a matting network that is straightforward yet very effective. AEMatter adopts a Hybrid-Transformer backbone with appearance-enhanced axis-wise learning (AEAL) blocks to build a basic network with strong context aggregation learning capability. Furthermore, AEMatter leverages a large image training strategy to assist the network in learning context aggregation from data. Extensive experiments on five popular matting datasets demonstrate that the proposed AEMatter outperforms state-of-the-art matting methods by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "The knee has gradually become an important research target for the lower extremity exoskeleton. However, the issue that whether the flexion-assisted profile based on the contractile element (CE) is effective throughout the gait is still a research gap. In this study, we first analyze the effective flexion-assisted method through the passive element's (PE) energy storage and release mechanism. Specifically, ensuring assisting within an entire joint power period and the human's active movement is a prerequisite for the CE-based flexion-assisted method. Second, we design the enhanced adaptive oscillator (EAO) to ensure the human's active movement and the integrity of the assistance profile. Third, a fundamental frequency estimation based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is proposed to shorten the convergence time of EAO significantly. The finite state machine (FSM) is designed to improve the stability and practicality of EAO. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the prerequisite condition for the CE-based flexion-assisted method by using electromyography (EMG) and metabolic indicators in experiments. In particular, for the knee joint, CE-based flexion assistance should be within an entire joint power period rather than just in the negative power phase. Ensuring the human's active movement will also significantly reduce the activation of antagonistic muscles. This study will aid in designing assistive methods from the perspective of natural human actuation and apply the EAO to the human-exoskeleton system.",

Additionally, these methods typically suffer from temporal inconsistency (e.g., flickering artifacts and motion blurs) when handling large-scale motions since the local perception property of CNNs limits them to model long-range dependencies in both spatial and temporal domains. To address these problems, we propose the first unsupervised method for low-light video enhancement to our best knowledge, named LightenFormer, which models long-range intra- and inter-frame dependencies with a spatial-temporal co-attention transformer to enhance brightness while maintaining temporal consistency. Specifically, an effective but lightweight S-curve Estimation Network (SCENet) is first proposed to estimate pixel-wise S-shaped non-linear curves (S-curves) to adaptively adjust the dynamic range of an input video. Next, to model the temporal consistency of the video, we present a Spatial-Temporal Refinement Network (STRNet) to refine the enhanced video. The core module of STRNet is a novel Spatial-Temporal Co-attention Transformer (STCAT), which exploits multi-scale self- and cross-attention interactions to capture long-range correlations in both spatial and temporal domains among frames for implicit motion estimation. To achieve unsupervised training, we further propose two non-reference loss functions based on the invertibility of the S-curve and the noise independence among frames. Extensive experiments on the SDSD and LLIV-Phone datasets demonstrate that our LightenFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Shadow generation aims to generate a plausible shadow for the inserted foreground object in a composite image. Besides the composite image and the associated mask of the inserted foreground object, existing methods also require a mask of all background objects as well as their shadows as an auxiliary input, which is laborious in practical applications. Meanwhile, most existing methods use a linear illumination transformation to darken the shadow region, which is prone to produce unrealistic shadows especially when background illumination is complex. To address these problems, this paper proposes an automatic shadow generation method, which avoids the laborious acquisition of the background object masks while harmonizing the shadow region to achieve plausible shadow effects. Specifically, to implicitly exploit background illumination to infer the shadow shape of the inserted foreground object, we first propose a Hierarchy Attention U-Net (HAU-Net) to sequentially build global interactions between the foreground object and background across spatial and channel dimensions. Since the spatial-variant property of the shadow, we formulate shadow harmonization as an exposure fusion problem and propose an Illumination-Aware Fusion Network (IFNet), which uses an improved illumination model with a double linear transformation to produce multiple under-exposure images of the shadow region. IFNet then learns pixel-wise fusion kernels that consider the local smoothness of the shadow to fuse the composite image with these under-exposure images to generate the realistic shadow of the foreground object. Extensive experiments on the DESOBA and Shadow-AR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for shadow generation on both the BOS and BOS-free test images.",

The realization of this challenge typically requires large amounts of labeled data and several hours of network fine-tuning. However, obtaining an annotated collection of images for each desired manipulation is usually very expensive and time-consuming. Recent works aim to overcome this limitation by leveraging the pre-trained models. While they are promising, the accuracy of the manipulation and the authenticity of the results cannot meet the needs of real face editing scenarios. To address these problems, this paper encodes the image and text description into a shared embedding space and proposes a unified image generation and manipulation framework by leveraging the powerful joint representation capability from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). With carefully designed network structures and loss functions, the proposed framework can learn a latent residual mapper network to map the input conditions into corresponding latent code residuals. This scheme enables the proposed method to perform high-quality face image generation and manipulation by leveraging the generative power from the pre-trained StyleGAN2 model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of manipulation accuracy, visual realism, and irrelevant attribute preservation. Reference Related Cited by",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating brain tumor and highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Herein, we introduce biomimetic nanosonosensitizer systems (MDNPs) combined with noninvasive ultrasound (US) actuation for orthotopic GBM-targeted delivery and sonodynamic-enhanced chemotherapy. MDNPs were fabricated with biodegradable and pH-sensitive polyglutamic acid (PGA) and the chemotherapeutic agent and sonosensitizer doxorubicin (DOX), camouflaged with human GBM U87 cell membranes. MDNPs presented homologous targeting accumulation and in vivo long-term circulation ability. They effectively passed through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under US assistance and reached the orthotopic GBM site. MDNPs exhibited controllable US-elicited sonodynamic effect by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS not only induced cancer cell apoptosis but also downregulated drug-resistance-related factors to disrupt chemoresistance and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. The in vivo study of orthotopic GBM treatments further proved that MDNPs exhibited US-augmented synergistic antitumor efficacy and strongly prolonged the survival rate of mice. The use of low-dose DOX and the safety of US enabled repeated treatment (4 times) without obvious cardiotoxicity. This effective and safe US-enhanced chemotherapy strategy with the advantages of noninvasive brain delivery and high drug sensitivity holds great promise for deep-seated and drug-resistant tumors.",

      "abstract": "Natural image matting is a challenging and significant task in computer vision. Recently, image matting achieves fantastic development by introducing deep learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, there is no image matting method using the Transformer. Compared with CNNs, the Transformer pays more attention to the interest points and the relationships of content, which is beneficial to the image matting task. In this paper, we first present a novel Transformer-based image matting method with Shifted Window self-Attention. Specifically, our method contains two encoders, an alpha encoder and a context encoder. The former leverages the Transformer with Shifted Window self-Attention to extract features of details, such as hairs, feathers and porous parts of foreground objects. Shifted Window self-Attention focuses on patches with the size of the window and connections of adjacent patches. With this, the Transformer is capable of dealing with high-resolution images. The context encoder, which takes rescaled images as input, aims to extract the whole structure information of foreground objects. Then, we propose a novel Hierarchical Pyramid Pooling Module (HPPM) which enables the network to have the flexibility to extract features at various resolutions. Experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on the Composition-1K dataset.",

      "abstract": "Existing image-based virtual try-on methods directly transfer specific clothing to a human image without utilizing clothing attributes to refine the transferred clothing geometry and textures, which causes incomplete and blurred clothing appearances. In addition, these methods usually mask the limb textures of the input for the clothing-agnostic person representation, which results in inaccurate predictions for human limb regions (i.e., the exposed arm skin), especially when transforming between long-sleeved and short-sleeved garments. To address these problems, we present a progressive virtual try-on framework, named PL-VTON, which performs pixel-level clothing warping based on multiple attributes of clothing and embeds explicit limb-aware features to generate photo-realistic try-on results. Specifically, we design a Multi-attribute Clothing Warping (MCW) module that adopts a two-stage alignment strategy based on multiple attributes to progressively estimate pixel-level clothing displacements. A Human Parsing Estimator (HPE) is then introduced to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and limb regions. Finally, we propose a Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) module to estimate high-quality details in limb regions by fusing textures of the clothing and the human body with the guidance of explicit limb-aware features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art virtual try-on methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. The code is available at https://github.com/xyhanHIT/PL-VTON.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Recently, the combination of deep learning and time-lapse imaging provides an objective, standard and scientific solution for embryo selection. However, the reported studies were based on blastocyst formation or clinical pregnancy as the end point. To the best of our knowledge, there is no predictive model that uses the outcome of live birth as the predictive end point. Can a deep learning model predict the probability of live birth from time-lapse system? Methods This study retrospectively analyzed the time-lapse data and live birth outcomes of embryos samples from January 2018 to November 2019. We used the SGD optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.025 and cosine learning rate reduction strategy. The network is randomly initialized and trained for 200 epochs from scratch. The model is quantitively evaluated over a hold-out test and a 5-fold cross-validation by the average area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results The deep learning model was able to predict live birth outcomes from time-lapse images with an AUC of 0.968 in 5-fold stratified cross-validation. Conclusions This research reported a deep learning model that predicts the live birth outcome of a single blastocyst transfer. This efficient model for predicting the outcome of live births can automatically analyze the time-lapse images of the patient’s embryos without the need for manual embryo annotation and evaluation, and then give a live birth prediction score for each embryo, and sort the embryos by the predicted value.",

      "abstract": "Variation of scales or aspect ratios has been one of the main challenges for tracking. To overcome this challenge, most existing methods adopt either multi-scale search or anchor-based schemes, which use a predefined search space in a handcrafted way and therefore limit their performance in complicated scenes. To address this problem, recent anchor-free based trackers have been proposed without using prior scale or anchor information. However, an inconsistency problem between classification and regression degrades the tracking performance. To address the above issues, we propose a simple yet effective tracker (named Siamese Box Adaptive Network, SiamBAN) to learn a target-aware scale handling schema in a data-driven manner. Our basic idea is to predict the target boxes in a per-pixel fashion through a fully convolutional network, which is anchor-free. Specifically, SiamBAN divides the tracking problem into classification and regression tasks, which directly predict objectiveness and regress bounding boxes, respectively. A no-prior box design is proposed to avoid tuning hyper-parameters related to candidate boxes, which makes SiamBAN more flexible. SiamBAN further uses a target-aware branch to address the inconsistency problem. Experiments on benchmarks including VOT2018, VOT2019, OTB100, UAV123, LaSOT and TrackingNet show that SiamBAN achieves promising performance and runs at 35 FPS.",

Since the end of World War Ⅱ, both Japan and South Korea have been politically, economically, militarily, and culturally influenced by the United States to a high degree. The Americanized version of democracy has been transformed and practiced differently in Japan and South Korea. Multiculturalism, the product of democratization and globalization, has also been advanced and developed in both Japan and South Korea. This study concludes by pointing out that the differences between Japanese and South Korean educational policies and pedagogical approaches to teaching immigrant children have resulted in different outcomes for immigrant children. Dissimilar notions of multiculturalism in Japan and South Korea have discursively constructed the notion of successful immigrants, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Trustworthy human-exoskeleton interaction essentially relates to determining the assistive force profile. Current methods of decoding human motor intent enable the customized determination of the assistive force profile by providing limited information of human kinetics. In this article, we propose and validate a novel motor intent decoding scheme that can enable a fully customized assistive force profile, where only inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used. First, we improve the robustness of the IMU-based kinematic estimation by sampling IMU measurements that well meet the hinge-joint assumption, and by online calibrating axes’ direction in order to avoid the post-hoc analysis of joint axes’ directions during the determination of the body-fixed coordinate frame. Second, using the calculated kinematics as input, we develop a computationally efficient dynamic model, through which kinetics of users can be calculated in real time. Finally, we leverage a cable-driven ankle exoskeleton method to validate the assistive performance of our motor intent decoding scheme. We perform experiments on ten healthy subjects to evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm, and the change of metabolic rate and muscle efforts under the exoskeleton’s assistance. The results show the improvement from determining the assistive force profile by nominal curves and the feasibility of our algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Natural image matting estimates the alpha values of unknown regions in the trimap. Recently, deep learning based methods propagate the alpha values from the known regions to unknown regions according to the similarity between them. However, we find that more than 50% pixels in the unknown regions cannot be correlated to pixels in known regions due to the limitation of small effective reception fields of common convolutional neural networks, which leads to inaccurate estimation when the pixels in the unknown regions cannot be inferred only with pixels in the reception fields. To solve this problem, we propose Long-Range Feature Propagating Network (LFPNet), which learns the long-range context features outside the reception fields for alpha matte estimation. Specifically, we first design the propagating module which extracts the context features from the downsampled image. Then, we present Center-Surround Pyramid Pooling (CSPP) that explicitly propagates the context features from the surrounding context image patch to the inner center image patch. Finally, we use the matting module which takes the image, trimap and context features to estimate the alpha matte. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on the AlphaMatting and Adobe Image Matting datasets.",

      "abstract": "A practical long-term tracker typically contains three key properties, i.e. an efficient model design, an effective global re-detection strategy and a robust distractor awareness mechanism. However, most state-of-the-art long-term trackers (e.g., Pseudo and re-detecting based ones) do not take all three key properties into account and therefore may either be time-consuming or drift to distractors. To address the issues, we propose a two-task tracking framework (named DMTrack), which utilizes two core components (i.e., one-shot detection and re-identification (re-id) association) to achieve distractor-aware fast tracking via Dynamic convolutions (d-convs) and Multiple object tracking (MOT) philosophy. To achieve precise and fast global detection, we construct a lightweight one-shot detector using a novel dynamic convolutions generation method, which provides a unified and more flexible way for fusing target information into the search field. To distinguish the target from distractors, we resort to the philosophy of MOT to reason distractors explicitly by maintaining all potential similarities' tracklets. Benefited from the strength of high recall detection and explicit object association, our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LaSOT, Ox-UvA, TLP, VOT2018LT and VOT2019LT benchmarks and runs in real-time (3x faster than comparisons) <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> .",

      "abstract": "Recently, several Space-Time Memory based networks have shown that the object cues (e.g. video frames as well as the segmented object masks) from the past frames are useful for segmenting objects in the current frame. However, these methods exploit the information from the memory by global-to-global matching between the current and past frames, which lead to mismatching to similar objects and high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel local-to-local matching solution for semi-supervised VOS, namely Regional Memory Network (RMNet). In RMNet, the precise regional memory is constructed by memorizing local regions where the target objects appear in the past frames. For the current query frame, the query regions are tracked and predicted based on the optical flow estimated from the previous frame. The proposed local-to-local matching effectively alleviates the ambiguity of similar objects in both memory and query frames, which allows the information to be passed from the regional memory to the query region efficiently and effectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed RM-Net performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets.",

      "abstract": "The fast-growing techniques of measuring and fusing multi-modal biomedical signals enable advanced motor intent decoding schemes of lower-limb exoskeletons, meeting the increasing demand for rehabilitative or assistive applications of take-home healthcare. Challenges of exoskeletons' motor intent decoding schemes remain in making a continuous prediction to compensate for the hysteretic response caused by mechanical transmission. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing an ahead-of-time continuous prediction of lower-limb kinematics, with the prediction of knee angles during level walking as a case study. Firstly, an end-to-end kinematics prediction network(KinPreNet), <xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sup>1</sup></xref> consisting of a feature extractor and an angle predictor, is proposed and experimentally compared with features and methods traditionally used in ahead-of-time prediction of gait phases. Secondly, inspired by the electromechanical delay(EMD), we further explore our algorithm's capability of compensating response delay of mechanical transmission by validating the performance of the different sections of prediction time. And we experimentally reveal the time boundary of compensating the hysteretic response. Thirdly, a comparison of employing EMG signals or not is performed to reveal the EMG and kinematic signals' collaborated contributions to the continuous prediction. During the experiments, EMG signals of nine muscles and knee angles calculated from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals are recorded from ten healthy subjects. Our algorithm can predict knee angles with the averaged RMSE of 3.98 deg which is better than the 15.95-deg averaged RMSE of utilizing the traditional methods of ahead-of-time prediction. The best prediction time is in the interval of 27ms and 108ms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of continuously predicting lower-limb kinematics in an ahead-of-time manner based on the electromechanical delay (EMD).",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer has caused the most cancer deaths in the past several years. Benign–malignant lung nodule classification is vital in lung nodule detection, which can help early diagnosis of lung cancer. Most existing works extract the features of chest CT images using the well-designed networks, which require substantial effort of experts. To automate the manual process of network design, we propose an attention-guided differentiable architecture search (A-DARTS) method, which directly searches for the optimal network on chest CT images. In addition, A-DARTS utilizes an attention mechanism to alleviate the effect of the initialization-sensitive nature of the searched network while enhancing the feature presentation ability. Extensive experiments on the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection (LIDC-IDRI) benchmark dataset show that the proposed method achieves a lung nodule classification accuracy of 92.93%, which is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Most of the existing trackers usually rely on either a multi-scale searching scheme or pre-defined anchor boxes to accurately estimate the scale and aspect ratio of a target. Unfortunately, they typically call for tedious and heuristic configurations. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective visual tracking framework (named Siamese Box Adaptive Network, SiamBAN) by exploiting the expressive power of the fully convolutional network (FCN). SiamBAN views the visual tracking problem as a parallel classification and regression problem, and thus directly classifies objects and regresses their bounding boxes in a unified FCN. The no-prior box design avoids hyper-parameters associated with the candidate boxes, making SiamBAN more flexible and general. Extensive experiments on visual tracking benchmarks including VOT2018, VOT2019, OTB100, NFS, UAV123, and LaSOT demonstrate that SiamBAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and runs at 40 FPS, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency. The code will be available at https://github.com/hqucv/siamban.",

      "abstract": "Scene text recognition with arbitrary shape is very challenging due to large variations in text shapes, fonts, colors, backgrounds, etc. Most state-of-the-art algorithms rectify the input image into the normalized image, then treat the recognition as a sequence prediction task. The bottleneck of such methods is the rectification, which will cause errors due to distortion perspective. In this paper, we find that the rectification is completely unnecessary. What all we need is the spatial attention. We therefore propose a simple but extremely effective scene text recognition method based on transformer [50]. Different from previous transformer based models [56,34], which just use the decoder of the transformer to decode the convolutional attention, the proposed method use a convolutional feature maps as word embedding input into transformer. In such a way, our method is able to make full use of the powerful attention mechanism of the transformer. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a very large margin on both regular and irregular text datasets. On one of the most challenging CUTE dataset whose state-of-the-art prediction accuracy is 89.6%, our method achieves 99.3%, which is a pretty surprising result. We will release our source code and believe that our method will be a new benchmark of scene text recognition with arbitrary shapes.",

This AI model has been tested in a real urban river basin. The evaluation results based on the model reveal that most parts of the river do not meetits management goal of being suitable for fireflies to inhabit. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis based on the AI Model is carried out to select and rank the river environment improvement measures in terms of the effectiveness of improvement. This study has shown that an AI Model is able to reveal and simulate the complicated relationships between river management goals and diverse river environment factors and also is able to make the sensitivity analysis and the selecting of effective river environment improvement measures much more convenient and reliable. This study will contribute to establishing a more reliable river environment planning and management methodology.",

      "abstract": "Light field imaging presents an attractive alternative to RGB imaging because of the recording of the direction of the incoming light. The detection of salient regions in a light field image benefits from the additional modeling of angular patterns. For RGB imaging, methods using CNNs have achieved excellent results on a range of tasks, including saliency detection. However, it is not trivial to use CNN-based methods for saliency detection on light field images because these methods are not specifically designed for processing light field inputs. In addition, current light field datasets are not sufficiently large to train CNNs. To overcome these issues, we present a new Lytro Illum dataset, which contains 640 light fields and their corresponding ground-truth saliency maps. Compared to current publicly available light field saliency datasets [1], [2], our new dataset is larger, of higher quality, contains more variation and more types of light field inputs. This makes our dataset suitable for training deeper networks and benchmarking. Furthermore, we propose a novel end-to-end CNN-based framework for light field saliency detection. Specifically, we propose three novel MAC (Model Angular Changes) blocks to process light field micro-lens images. We systematically study the impact of different architecture variants and compare light field saliency with regular 2D saliency. Our extensive comparisons indicate that our novel network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset and has desired generalization abilities on other existing datasets.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in several face-related tasks, such as face detection, alignment and recognition. As a fundamental problem in computer vision, face tracking plays a crucial role in various applications, such as video surveillance, human emotion detection and human-computer interaction. However, few CNN-based approaches are proposed for face (bounding box) tracking. In this paper, we propose a face tracking method based on Siamese CNNs, which takes advantages of powerful representations of hierarchical CNN features learned from massive face images. The proposed method captures discriminative face information at both local and global levels. At the local level, representations for attribute patches (i.e:, eyes, nose and mouth) are learned to distinguish a face from another one, which are robust to pose changes and occlusions. At the global level, representations for each whole face are learned, which take into account the spatial relationships among local patches and facial characters, such as skin color and nevus. In addition, we build a new largescale challenging face tracking dataset to evaluate face tracking methods and to facilitate the research forward in this field. Extensive experiments on the collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to several state-of-theart visual tracking methods.",

      "abstract": "Recent years deep learning based visual object trackers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. However, most of these trackers lack an effective mechanism to avoid the wrong template update or re-detect the object when unreliable tracking result appears. In this paper, a novel tracking framework consisting of a tracking network for locating the target and a policy network for decision making is proposed. Firstly, during the off-line training phase, a variant of policy gradient algorithm is adopted, which makes the model converge better and faster. Secondly, current response map and history response map are both fed to the policy network to check the reliability of the tracking result, which effectively distinguishes the response diversity. Finally, an efficient redetection module is proposed to filter a large number of searching areas, which greatly improves the speed. Our proposed algorithm is measured on OTB dataset. Assessment results show that our tracking algorithm improves performance by 5%-6% at the expense of only a small amount of speed.",

      "abstract": "Given massive video data generated from different applications such as security monitoring and traffic management, to save cost and human labour, developing an industrial intelligent video analytic system, which can automatically extract and analyze the meaningful content of videos, is essential. For achieving the objective of motion perception in video analytic system, a key problem is how to perform effective tracking of object of interest so that the location and the status of the tracked object can be inferred accurately. To solve this problem, with the popularity of RGB-infrared dual camera systems, this paper proposes a new RGB-infrared tracking framework which aims to exploit information from both RGB and infrared modalities to enhance the tracking robustness. In particular, within the tracking framework, a robust multi-modality anchor graph-based label prediction model is developed, which is able to 1) construct a scalable graph representation of the relationship of the samples based on local anchor approximation; 2) defuse a limited amount of known labels to large amount of unlabeled sample efficiently based on transductive learning strategy; and 3) adaptive incorporate importance weights for measuring modality discriminability. Efficient optimization algorithms are derived to solve the prediction model. Experimental results on various multi- modality videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Most of them can be combined by the eigen factor, which represents the property of structure itself, including parameters of cross-section and member. The classical differential equation is used to make a parameter analysis. The results show that in the range of practice, the influences of the eigen factor are critical and nonlinear, and the stiffness reduction ratio in buildings is large, about 0.8 in the example.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in visual tracking. Most of existing methods train or fine-tune a binary classifier to distinguish the target from its background. However, they may suffer from the performance degradation due to insufficient training data. In this paper, we show that attribute information (e.g., illumination changes, occlusion and motion) in the context facilitates training an effective classifier for visual tracking. In particular, we design an attribute-based CNN with multiple branches, where each branch is responsible for classifying the target under a specific attribute. Such a design reduces the appearance diversity of the target under each attribute and thus requires less data to train the model. We combine all attributespecific features via ensemble layers to obtain more discriminative representations for the final target/background classification. The proposed method achieves favorable performance on the OTB100 dataset compared to state-of-the-art tracking methods. After being trained on the VOT datasets, the proposed network also shows a good generalization ability on the UAV-Traffic dataset, which has significantly different attributes and target appearances with the VOT datasets.",

      "abstract": "Naturally occurring cyclic peptides are rich sources of bioactive compounds that can be developed as novel pharmaceuticals with high selectivity and potency. However, the scarcity of their existence in nature impedes their further applications, which make the chemical synthesis of these intriguing compounds an imperative task. In this thesis, the total syntheses of nine naturally occurring cyclic peptides, along with two of their analogues, are described and some of these compounds are also evaluated for potential biological activity. Dianthin I (Chapter 2), pseudostellarin A (Chapter 2), heterophyllin J (Chapter 2) are three cyclic pentapeptides consisting of all proteinogenic amino acids. Their total syntheses were achieved by preparing the protected linear peptide precursors via Fmoc-solid phase synthesis (Fmoc-SPPS) followed by a classic solution-phase peptide cyclization. The same strategy was also applied to the syntheses of onychocins and their analogues (Chapter 3), which are a series of cyclotetrapeptides featuring the alternative presence of NMe-Phe in the peptide sequence. The unusual cyclization reagent, 2-propanephosphonic acid anhydride, was employed in peptide cyclization, which not only furnished the desired cyclic tetrapetides in reasonable yields but also generated several unstable cyclic peptide conformers in addition to the stable trans,cis,trans,cis cyclopeptides. Talarolide A (Chapter 4) is a cyclic heptapeptide containing a hydroxamate moiety within the peptide backbone. The proposed structure of talarolide A was successfully prepared from three different cyclization sites using a similar synthetic strategy as mentioned above. Despite the mismatch of the NMR data between the synthetic talarolide A and the natural product, a detailed structural analysis using 2D NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the synthetic product has the reported structure of talarolide A. The structure of the original natural product is therefore questioned. In addition, the first synthesis of the anti-TB cyclic peptide callyaerin A (Chapter 5), containing a rare (Z)-2,3-diaminoacrylamide (DAA) bridging motif, was also accomplished. Fmoc-formylglycine-diethylacetal was used as a masked equivalent of formylglycine in the synthesis of the linear precursor. Subsequent intramolecular cyclization between the formylglycine residue and the N-terminal amine in the linear peptide precursor afforded the macrocyclic natural product in high yield. Synthetic callyaerin A possessed potent anti-TB activity (MIC100 = 32 μM) while its all-amide congener was inactive. A variable temperature NMR of callyearin A and its all-amide counterpart demonstrated the high conformational rigidity imposed by the DAA moiety on the peptide structure, thus indicating its potential as a novel conformational constraint for peptides.",

      "abstract": "Computational color constancy refers to the estimation of the scene illumination and makes the perceived color relatively stable under varying illumination. In the past few years, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have delivered superior performance in illuminant estimation. Several representative methods formulate it as a multi-label prediction problem by learning the local appearance of image patches using CNNs. However, these approaches inevitably make incorrect estimations for the ambiguous patches affected by their neighborhood contexts. Inaccurate local estimates are likely to bring in degraded performance when combining into a global prediction. To address the above issues, we propose a contextual deep network for patch-based illuminant estimation equipped with refinement. First, the contextual net with a center-surround architecture extracts local contextual features from image patches, and generates initial illuminant estimates and the corresponding color corrected patches. The patches are sampled based on the observation that pixels with large color differences describe the illumination well. Then, the refinement net integrates the input patches with the corrected patches in conjunction with the use of intermediate features to improve the performance. To train such a network with numerous parameters, we propose a stage-wise training strategy, in which the features and the predicted illuminant from previous stages are provided to the next learning stage with more finer estimates recovered. Experiments show that our approach obtains competitive performance on two illuminant estimation benchmarks.",

Creep Fiber method is used to obtain the time-depedent results, which proved to be quiet effect in both elastic and visco-elastic analysis. Only two individual centrical loading points or bars need considering, and then the system of two sumultaneous differential equations becomes simple in a clear fashion. It can be solved analyically by Rüsch constitutive equation of creep. For high and large beams of bridge structures the fibres of the two points are constant over time because the radius of inertial of steel beam is far larger than that of concrete slab, which simplifies the procedure further. The results show that under sustained loading creep of concrete produces significant negative effects. It may increase the modular ratio to 2.3 times of the initial, reduce the whole flexural stiffness by 76%, and cause the local buckling risk of the top flange and web of steel beam. These should be considered in the design of structure.",

The effects of increasing the steel height of composite beam are quiet different from that of the pure steel beam because of composite and creep effects. To reveal the influences of this critical prarameter Rüsch constitutive equation of creep is used to obtain the exact results. With the increase of the steel height and after a limiting value is reached, the rate of the increase of the whole section stiffness becomes smaller, the rate of the increase of the compression zone of steel web becomes larger, yet the axial force and redistributed moment of concrete slab become almost constant. The deflection increases almost linearly and keeps a large slope with the increase of the steel height. Local buckling risk of the web must be considered.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep model for unbalanced distribution Character Recognition by employing focal loss based connectionist temporal classification (CTC) function. Previous works utilize Traditional CTC to compute prediction losses. However, some datasets may consist of extremely unbalanced samples, such as Chinese. In other words, both training and testing sets contain large amounts of low‐frequent samples. The low‐frequent samples have very limited influence on the model during training. To solve this issue, we modify the traditional CTC by fusing focal loss with it and thus make the model attend to the low‐frequent samples at training stage. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two types of datasets: synthetic and real image sequence datasets. The results on both datasets demonstrate that the proposed focal CTC loss function achieves desired performance on unbalanced datasets. Specifically, our method outperforms traditional CTC by 3 to 9 percentages in accuracy on average.",

      "abstract": "Traditional image compressed sensing (CS) coding frameworks solve an inverse problem that is based on the measurement coding tools (prediction, quantization, entropy coding, etc.) and the optimization based image reconstruction method. These CS coding frameworks face the challenges of improving the coding efficiency at the encoder, while also suffering from high computational complexity at the decoder. In this paper, we move forward a step and propose a novel deep network based CS coding framework of natural images, which consists of three sub-networks: sampling sub-network, offset sub-network and reconstruction sub-network that responsible for sampling, quantization and reconstruction, respectively. By cooperatively utilizing these sub-networks, it can be trained in the form of an end-to-end metric with a proposed rate-distortion optimization loss function. The proposed framework not only improves the coding performance, but also reduces the computational cost of the image reconstruction dramatically. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of achieving superior rate-distortion performance against state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Automated recognition of mouse behaviors is crucial in studying psychiatric and neurologic diseases. To achieve this objective, it is very important to analyze the temporal dynamics of mouse behaviors. In particular, the change between mouse neighboring actions is swift in a short period. In this paper, we develop and implement a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm to describe the temporal characteristics of mouse behaviors. In particular, we here propose a hybrid deep learning architecture, where the first unsupervised layer relies on an advanced spatial-temporal segment Fisher vector encoding both visual and contextual features. Subsequent supervised layers based on our segment aggregate network are trained to estimate the state-dependent observation probabilities of the HMM. The proposed architecture shows the ability to discriminate between visually similar behaviors and results in high recognition rates with the strength of processing imbalanced mouse behavior datasets. Finally, we evaluate our approach using JHuang's and our own datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "The performance of a synthetic aperture radar automatic (SAR) target recognition system mainly depends on feature extraction and classification. It is crucial to select discriminative features to train a classifier to achieve desired performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature extraction and classification algorithm based on a visual saliency model. First, an SAR-oriented graph-based visual saliency model is introduced. Second, relying on the ability of our saliency model in highlighting the most significant regions, Gabor and histogram of oriented gradients features are extracted from the processed SAR images. Third, in order to have more discriminative features, the discrimination correlation analysis algorithm is used for feature fusion and combination. Finally, a two-level directed acyclic graph (DAG) support vector metric learning is developed that seamlessly takes advantage of a two-level DAG by eliminating weak classifiers and the Mahalanobis distance-based radial basis function kernel which emphasizes relevant features and reduces the influence of noninformative features. Experiments on real SAR data from the MSTAR database are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Compressed Sensing (CS) has been successfully applied to image compression in the past few years. However, there are still several challenges that restrict its applications in practice including large memory requirement and unsatisfactory reconstruction performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a classification guided deep convolutional network for image compressed sensing (CCSNet), which includes a sampling sub-network and a reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, multiple convolutional layers are used to sample the original image, which significantly reduces the parameters of the sampling matrix while causes performance degradation moderately compared against existing convolution based sampling methods. In the reconstruction sub-network, a novel two-branch architecture is proposed to improve the adaptability of the model to various textures in natural images. The first branch, named the classification branch, is to classify the sampled measurements of the original image to one of the predefined textural classes. The second branch, named the reconstruction branch, consists of multiple sub-branches, which are responsible for reconstructing the original images belonging to the corresponding textural classes. By jointly utilizing two sub-networks, the entire network can be trained in the form of end-to-end metric with a joint loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a significant quality improvement in terms of PSNR compared against state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Tracking target of interests is an important step for motion perception in intelligent video surveillance systems. While most recently developed tracking algorithms are grounded in RGB image sequences, it should be noted that information from RGB modality is not always reliable (e.g. in a dark environment with poor lighting condition), which urges the need to integrate information from infrared modality for effective tracking because of the insensitivity to illumination condition of infrared thermal camera. However, several issues encountered during the tracking process limit the fusing performance of these heterogeneous modalities: 1) the cross-modality discrepancy of visual and motion characteristics, 2) the uncertainty of degree of reliability in different modalities, and 3) large target appearance variations and background distractions within each modality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel and optimal discriminative learning framework for multi-modality tracking. In particular, the proposed discriminative learning framework is able to: 1) jointly eliminate outlier samples caused by large variations and learn discriminability-consistent features from heterogeneous modalities, and 2) collaboratively perform modality reliability measurement and target-background separation. Extensive experiments on RGB-infrared image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to visual tracking with demonstrated success in recent years. Most CNN-based trackers utilize hierarchical features extracted from a certain layer to represent the target. However, features from a certain layer are not always effective for distinguishing the target object from the backgrounds especially in the presence of complicated interfering factors (e.g., heavy occlusion, background clutter, illumination variation, and shape deformation). In this work, we propose a CNN-based tracking algorithm which hedges deep features from different CNN layers to better distinguish target objects and background clutters. Correlation filters are applied to feature maps of each CNN layer to construct a weak tracker, and all weak trackers are hedged into a strong one. For robust visual tracking, we propose a hedge method to adaptively determine weights of weak classifiers by considering both the difference between the historical as well as instantaneous performance, and the difference among all weak trackers over time. In addition, we design a Siamese network to define the loss of each weak tracker for the proposed hedge method. Extensive experiments on large benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art tracking methods.",

      "abstract": "The compressed sensing (CS) has been successfully applied to image compression in the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain domain. Several CS reconstruction models have been proposed and obtained superior performance. However, these methods suffer from blocking artifacts or ringing effects at low sampling ratios in most cases. To address this problem, we propose a deep convolutional Laplacian Pyramid Compressed Sensing Network (LapC-SNet) for CS, which consists of a sampling sub-network and a reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, we utilize a convolutional layer to mimic the sampling operator. In contrast to the fixed sampling matrices used in traditional CS methods, the filters used in our convolutional layer are jointly optimized with the reconstruction sub-network. In the reconstruction sub-network, two branches are designed to reconstruct multi -scale residual images and muti -scale target images progressively using a Laplacian pyramid architecture. The proposed LapCSNet not only integrates multi-scale information to achieve better performance but also reduces computational cost dramatically. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of reconstructing more details and sharper edges against the state-of-the-arts methods.",

      "abstract": "Sparse coding has been applied to visual tracking and related vision problems with demonstrated success in recent years. Existing tracking methods based on local sparse coding sample patches from a target candidate and sparsely encode these using a dictionary consisting of patches sampled from target template images. The discriminative strength of existing methods based on local sparse coding is limited as spatial structure constraints among the template patches are not exploited. To address this problem, we propose a structure-aware local sparse coding algorithm, which encodes a target candidate using templates with both global and local sparsity constraints. For robust tracking, we show the local regions of a candidate region should be encoded only with the corresponding local regions of the target templates that are the most similar from the global view. Thus, a more precise and discriminative sparse representation is obtained to account for appearance changes. To alleviate the issues with tracking drifts, we design an effective template update scheme. Extensive experiments on challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against numerous state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "The use of multiple features has been shown to be an effective strategy for visual tracking because of their complementary contributions to appearance modeling. The key problem is how to learn a fused representation from multiple features for appearance modeling. Different features extracted from the same object should share some commonalities in their representations while each feature should also have some feature-specific representation patterns which reflect its complementarity in appearance modeling. Different from existing multi-feature sparse trackers which only consider the commonalities among the sparsity patterns of multiple features, this paper proposes a novel multiple sparse representation framework for visual tracking which jointly exploits the shared and feature-specific properties of different features by decomposing multiple sparsity patterns. Moreover, we introduce a novel online multiple metric learning to efficiently and adaptively incorporate the appearance proximity constraint, which ensures that the learned commonalities of multiple features are more representative. Experimental results on tracking benchmark videos and other challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracker.",

      "abstract": "For autonomous driving application, a car shall be able to track objects in the scene in order to estimate where and how they will move such that the tracker embedded in the car can efficiently alert the car for effective collision-avoidance. Traditional discriminative object tracking methods usually train a binary classifier via a support vector machine (SVM) scheme to distinguish the target from its background. Despite demonstrated success, the performance of the SVM-based trackers is limited because the classification is carried out only depending on support vectors (SVs) but the target's dynamic appearance may look similar to the training samples that have not been selected as SVs, especially when the training samples are not linearly classifiable. In such cases, the tracker may drift to the background and fail to track the target eventually. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose to integrate the point-to-set/image-to-imageSet distance metric learning (DML) into visual tracking tasks and take full advantage of all the training samples when determining the best target candidate. The point-to-set DML is conducted on convolutional neural network features of the training data extracted from the starting frames. When a new frame comes, target candidates are first projected to the common subspace using the learned mapping functions, and then the candidate having the minimal distance to the target template sets is selected as the tracking result. Extensive experimental results show that even without model update the proposed method is able to achieve favorable performance on challenging image sequences compared with several state-of-the-art trackers.",

However, the efficient synthesis of compounds embodying this unique functionality remains an arduous task, especially in the case of enediamino peptides. An overview of the reported methods for the syntheses of enediamino amino acid analogues and peptides is provided in this review with the aim of facilitating further investigations into these promising compounds. More information can be found in the Focus Review by Margaret A. Brimble et al. on page 1180 in Issue 9, 2017 (DOI: 10.1002/ajoc.201700169).",

Several CS reconstruction models have been recently proposed and obtained superior performance. However, there still exist two important challenges within the CS theory. The first one is how to design a sampling mechanism to achieve an optimal sampling efficiency, and the second one is how to perform the reconstruction to get the highest quality to achieve an optimal signal recovery. In this paper, we try to deal with these two problems with a deep network. First of all, we train a sampling matrix via the network training instead of using a traditional manually designed one, which is much appropriate for our deep network based reconstruct process. Then, we propose a deep network to recover the image, which imitates traditional compressed sensing reconstruction processes. Experimental results demonstrate that our deep networks based CS reconstruction method offers a very significant quality improvement compared against state-of-the-art ones.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study one-shot learning gesture recognition on RGB-D data recorded from Microsoft’s Kinect. To this end, we propose a novel bag of manifold words (BoMW) based feature representation on sysmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds. In particular, we use covariance matrices to extract local features from RGB-D data due to its compact representation ability as well as the convenience of fusing both RGB and depth information. Since covariance matrices are SPD matrices and the space spanned by them is the SPD manifold, traditional learning methods in the Euclidean space such as sparse coding can not be directly applied to them. To overcome this problem, we propose a unified framework to transfer the sparse coding on SPD manifolds to the one on the Euclidean space, which enables any existing learning method can be used. After building BoMW representation on a video from each gesture class, a nearest neighbour classifier is adopted to perform the one-shot learning gesture recognition. Experimental results on the ChaLearn gesture dataset demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed one-shot learning gesture recognition method compared against state-of-the-art methods. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is also validated on a new RGB-D action recognition dataset.",

      "abstract": "Modeling the process of information diffusion is a challenging problem. Although numerous attempts have been made in order to solve this problem, very few studies are actually able to simulate and predict temporal dynamics of the diffusion process. In this paper, we propose a novel information diffusion model, namely GT model, which treats the nodes of a network as intelligent and rational agents and then calculates their corresponding payoffs, given different choices to make strategic decisions. By introducing time-related payoffs based on the diffusion data, the proposed GT model can be used to predict whether or not the user's behaviors will occur in a specific time interval. The user's payoff can be divided into two parts: social payoff from the user's social contacts and preference payoff from the user's idiosyncratic preference. We here exploit the global influence of the user and the social influence between any two users to accurately calculate the social payoff. In addition, we develop a new method of presenting social influence that can fully capture the temporal dynamics of social influence. Experimental results from two different datasets, Sina Weibo and Flickr demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method with different evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "In the past years, skin beautifying softwares have been widely used in portable devices for social activities, which have the functionalities of turning one's skin into flawless complexion. With a huge number of photos uploaded to social media, it is useful for users to distinguish whether a photo is beautified or not. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a skin beautification detection method by mining and distinguishing the intrinsic features of original photos and the corresponding beautified photos. To this aim, we propose to use sparse coding to learn two sets of basis functions using densely sampled patches from the original photos and the beautified photos, respectively. To detect whether a test photo is beautified, we represent the sampled patches from the photo using the learned basis functions and then see which set of basis functions produces more sparse coefficients. To our knowledge, our effort is the first one to detect skin beautification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we collected about 1000 photos including both the original photos and the photos beautified by a software. Our experimental results indicate the proposed method achieved a desired detection accuracy of over 80%.",

Traditional intra prediction methods for HEVC rely on using the nearest reference lines for predicting a block, which ignore much richer context between the current block and its neighboring blocks and therefore cause inaccurate prediction especially when weak spatial correlation exists between the current block and the reference lines. To overcome this problem, in this paper, an intra-prediction convolutional neural network (IPCNN) is proposed for intra prediction, which exploits the rich context of the current block and therefore is capable of improving the accuracy of predicting the current block. Meanwhile, the reconstruction of the three nearest blocks can also be refined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that directly applies CNNs to intra prediction for HEVC. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of applying CNNs to intra prediction and the proposed method can achieve 0.70% bitrate reduction compared to HEVC reference software HM-14.0.",

Traditional image coding standards (such as JPEG and JPEG2000) make the decoded image suffer from many blocking artifacts or noises since the use of big quantization steps. To overcome this problem, we proposed an end-to-end compression framework based on two CNNs, as shown in Figure 1, which produce a compact representation for encoding using a third party coding standard and reconstruct the decoded image, respectively. To make two CNNs effectively collaborate, we develop a unified end-to-end learning framework to simultaneously learn CrCNN and ReCNN such that the compact representation obtained by CrCNN preserves the structural information of the image, which facilitates to accurately reconstruct the decoded image using ReCNN and also makes the proposed compression framework compatible with existing image coding standards.",

      "abstract": "Manual measurement of mouse behavior is highly labor intensive and prone to error. This investigation aims to efficiently and accurately recognize individual mouse behaviors in action videos and continuous videos. In our system each mouse action video is expressed as the collection of a set of interest points. We extract both appearance and contextual features from the interest points collected from the training datasets, and then obtain two Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dictionaries for the visual and contextual features. The two GMM dictionaries are leveraged by our spatial-temporal stacked Fisher Vector (FV) to represent each mouse action video. A neural network is used to classify mouse action and finally applied to annotate continuous video. The novelty of our proposed approach is: (i) our method exploits contextual features from spatiotemporal interest points, leading to enhanced performance, (ii) we encode contextual features and then fuse them with appearance features, and (iii) location information of a mouse is extracted from spatio-temporal interest points to support mouse behavior recognition. We evaluate our method against the database of Jhuang et al. (Jhuang et al., 2010) and the results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Recently, sparse representation based visual tracking methods have attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community. Although achieve superior performance to traditional tracking methods, however, a basic problem has not been answered yet --- that whether the sparsity constrain is really needed for visual tracking? To answer this question, in this paper, we first propose a robust non-sparse representation based tracker and then conduct extensive experiments to compare it against several state-of-the-art sparse representation based trackers. Our experiment results and analysis indicate that the proposed non-sparse tracker achieved competitive tracking accuracy with sparse trackers while having faster running speed, which support our non-sparse tracker to be used in practical applications.",

Although achieve\\nsuperior performance to traditional tracking methods, however, a basic problem\\nhas not been answered yet --- that whether the sparsity constrain is really\\nneeded for visual tracking? To answer this question, in this paper, we first\\npropose a robust non-sparse representation based tracker and then conduct\\nextensive experiments to compare it against several state-of-the-art sparse\\nrepresentation based trackers. Our experiment results and analysis indicate\\nthat the proposed non-sparse tracker achieved competitive tracking accuracy\\nwith sparse trackers while having faster running speed, which support our\\nnon-sparse tracker to be used in practical applications.\\n",

Motivated in part by the success of the hierarchical organization of the primary visual cortex (area V1), we establish an architecture consisting of five layers: whitening, rectification, normalization, coding, and pooling. The first three layers stem from the models developed for object recognition. In this paper, our attention focuses on the coding and pooling layers. In particular, we use a discriminative sparse coding method in the coding layer along with spatial pyramid representation in the pooling layer, which makes it easier to distinguish the target to be tracked from its background in the presence of appearance variations. An extensive experimental study shows that the proposed method has higher tracking accuracy than several state-of-the-art trackers.",

      "abstract": "Because of the complementarity of multiple visual cues (features) in appearance modeling, many tracking algorithms attempt to fuse multiple features to improve the tracking performance from two aspects: increasing the representation accuracy against appearance variations and enhancing the discriminability between the tracked target and its background. Since both these two aspects simultaneously contribute to the success of a visual tracker, how to fully unleash the capabilities of multiple features from these two aspects in appearance modeling is a key issue for feature fusion-based visual tracking. To address this problem, different from other feature fusion-based trackers which consider one of these two aspects only, this paper proposes an unified feature learning framework which simultaneously exploits both the representation capability and the discriminability of multiple features for visual tracking. In particular, the proposed feature learning framework is capable of: 1) learning robust features by separating out corrupted features for accurate feature representation, 2) seamlessly imposing the discriminabiltiy of multiple visual cues into feature learning, and 3) fusing features by exploiting their shared and feature-specific discriminative information. Extensive experiment results on challenging videos show that the the proposed tracker performs favourably against other ten state-of-the-art trackers.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, several methods have been developed to utilize hierarchical features learned from a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for visual tracking. However, as features from a certain CNN layer characterize an object of interest from only one aspect or one level, the performance of such trackers trained with features from one layer (usually the second to last layer) can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN based tracking framework, which takes full advantage of features from different CNN layers and uses an adaptive Hedge method to hedge several CNN based trackers into a single stronger one. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset of 100 challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to several state-of-theart trackers.",

      "abstract": "Most existing tracking approaches are based on either the tracking by detection framework or the tracking by matching framework. The former needs to learn a discriminative classifier using positive and negative samples, which will cause tracking drift due to unreliable samples. The latter usually performs tracking by matching local interest points between a target candidate and the tracked target, which is not robust to target appearance changes over time. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking by matching framework for robust tracking based on basis matching rather than point matching. In particular, we learn the target model from target images using a set of Gabor basis functions, which have large responses on the corresponding spatial positions after a max pooling. During tracking, a target candidate is evaluated by computing the responses of the Gabor basis functions on their corresponding spatial positions. The experimental results on a set of challenging sequences validate that the performance of the proposed tracking method outperforms those of several state-of-the-art methods.",

This challenge is central for paleobotany because most angiosperm fossils are isolated, unidentified leaves. We here demonstrate that a computer vision algorithm trained on several thousand images of diverse cleared leaves successfully learns leaf-architectural features, then categorizes novel specimens into natural botanical groups above the species level. The system also produces heat maps to display the locations of numerous novel, informative leaf characters in a visually intuitive way. With assistance from computer vision, the systematic and paleobotanical value of leaves is ready to increase significantly.",

In the Histograms of Oriented Gradients descriptor (HOG), the zero-order information of the gradients is captured. By contrast, in the HLAOG descriptor we accumulate the differences between gradient orientations and their nearest bin centers, which characterizes the distribution of the gradient orientations in regard to the bin centers. The HLAOG descriptor is demonstrated to be complementary to HOG in the experiments. Then, for setting the weights of the votes on different bins in a better way, we choose Gaussian function as the weighting method and present another new Gaussian Weighted Histograms of Oriented Gradients descriptor (called GWHOG) based on HOG. Evaluations on two public object recognition datasets (Caltech-101 and VOC2007) show that the combination of HOG and HLAOG outperforms HOG and the combination of HLAOG and GWHOG gets the best result.",

      "abstract": "Visual saliency is one of the most noteworthy perceptual abilities of human vision. Recent progress in cognitive psychology suggests that: 1) visual saliency analysis is mainly completed by the bottom-up mechanism consisting of feedforward low-level processing in primary visual cortex (area V1) and 2) color interacts with spatial cues and is influenced by the neighborhood context, and thus it plays an important role in a visual saliency analysis. From a computational perspective, the most existing saliency modeling approaches exploit multiple independent visual cues, irrespective of their interactions (or are not computed explicitly), and ignore contextual influences induced by neighboring colors. In addition, the use of color is often underestimated in the visual saliency analysis. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective color saliency model that considers color as the only visual cue and mimics the color processing in V1. Our approach uses region-/boundary-defined color features with spatiochromatic filtering by considering local color-orientation interactions, therefore captures homogeneous color elements, subtle textures within the object and the overall salient object from the color image. To account for color contextual influences, we present a divisive normalization method for chromatic stimuli through the pooling of contrary/complementary color units. We further define a color perceptual metric over the entire scene to produce saliency maps for color regions and color boundaries individually. These maps are finally globally integrated into a one single saliency map. The final saliency map is produced by Gaussian blurring for robustness. We evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic stimuli and several benchmark saliency data sets from the visual saliency analysis to salient object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of color as a unique visual cue achieves competitive results on par with or better than 12 state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Group detection becomes an important task in crowd behavior surveillance. However, most existing methods ignore the formation persistency characteristics, which predict unreliable interactions when the crowd is realistic and complex. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based method to declare that the formation period really matters for detecting social groups in crowd. First, we develop a socially motivated representation by modeling the formation period probability in a Bayesian manner, which results in social and temporal consistency for group member interactions. A graph is then established using individuals as nodes and formation periods as edge weights to reflect pedestrian relationships. In this way, seeking of socially consistent groups is converted into an optimization problem which seeks dense subgraphs with maximum formation likelihood within the graph structure. We employ graph shift optimization to detect groups by finding all the dense subgraphs due to its robust performance. In the experimental results on public datasets, our proposed method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel approach to non-rigid objects contour tracking in this paper based on a supervised level set model (SLSM). In contrast to most existing trackers that use bounding box to specify the tracked target, the proposed method extracts the accurate contours of the target as tracking output, which achieves better description of the non-rigid objects while reduces background pollution to the target model. Moreover, conventional level set models only emphasize the regional intensity consistency and consider no priors. Differently, the curve evolution of the proposed SLSM is object-oriented and supervised by the specific knowledge of the targets we want to track. Therefore, the SLSM can ensure a more accurate convergence to the exact targets in tracking applications. In particular, we firstly construct the appearance model for the target in an online boosting manner due to its strong discriminative power between the object and the background. Then, the learnt target model is incorporated to model the probabilities of the level set contour by a Bayesian manner, leading the curve converge to the candidate region with maximum likelihood of being the target. Finally, the accurate target region qualifies the samples fed to the boosting procedure as well as the target model prepared for the next time step. We firstly describe the proposed mechanism of two-phase SLSM for single target tracking, then give its generalized multi-phase version for dealing with multi-target tracking cases. Positive decrease rate is used to adjust the learning pace over time, enabling tracking to continue under partial and total occlusion. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices in the form of region covariances are considered rich descriptors for images and videos. Recent studies suggest that exploiting the Riemannian geometry of the SPD manifolds could lead to improved performances for vision applications. For tasks involving processing large-scale and dynamic data in computer vision, the underlying model is required to progressively and efficiently adapt itself to the new and unseen observations. Motivated by these requirements, this paper studies the problem of online dictionary learning on the SPD manifolds. We make use of the Stein divergence to recast the problem of online dictionary learning on the manifolds to a problem in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, for which, we develop efficient algorithms by taking into account the geometric structure of the SPD manifolds. To our best knowledge, our work is the first study that provides a solution for online dictionary learning on the SPD manifolds. Empirical results on both large-scale image classification task and dynamic video processing tasks validate the superior performance of our approach as compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Sparse representation-based visual tracking approaches have attracted increasing interests in the community in recent years. The main idea is to linearly represent each target candidate using a set of target and trivial templates, while imposing a sparsity constraint onto the representation coefficients. After we obtain the coefficients using l(1)-norm minimization methods, the candidate with the lowest error, when it is reconstructed using only the target templates and the associated coefficients, is considered as the tracking result. In spite of promising system performance widely reported, it is unclear if the performance of these trackers can be maximized. In addition, computational complexity caused by the dimensionality of the feature space limits these algorithms in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a real-time visual tracking method based on structurally random projection (RP) and weighted least squares (WLS) techniques. In particular, to enhance the discriminative capability of the tracker, we introduce background templates to the linear representation framework. To handle appearance variations over time, we relax the sparsity constraint using a WLS method to obtain the representation coefficients. To further reduce the computational complexity, structurally RP is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, while preserving the pairwise distances between the data points in the feature space. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art tracking methods.",

      "abstract": "Previous work has developed a visual tracking algorithm, based on sparsity, that represents a target as a superposition of templates from a gallery in a fashion that the coefficients are sparsely populated. When occlusions occur, sparsity is maintained by bringing additional trivial templates (identity bases) into that gallery. While reported desirable results in visual tracking applications, several researches in recognition community have questioned the effectiveness of imposing L1 norm based sparsityconstraint and recommended collaborative representation, which replaces L2 norm as the measure of sparsity. Little work has been done in visual tracking to access the usefulness of the sparsity for visual tracking. This work aims to present a study on sparse and collaborative representation in the context of visual tracking and demonstrate which representation is really useful to achieve better tracking performance. To this end, extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging sequences and a discussion based on the experimental comparison is presented.",

      "abstract": "Videos taken under low lighting condition usually have serious loss of visibility and contrast and are inconvenient for observation and analysis. To solve this problem, this paper presents a real-time night video enhancement approach. As observed that a pixel-wise inversion of a night video has quite similar appearance with the video acquired at foggy days, we use the similar idea of haze removal method to enhance the perceptual quality of the night videos. We present an improved dark channel prior model and integrate it with local smoothing and image Gaussian Pyramid operators. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the perceptual quality of night videos in real-time in terms of not only enhancing details, but also effectively avoiding excessive enhancement phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel method based on sparsely coded motion attention for detecting abnormal events in crowded scenes. Unlike existing sparse coding based approaches, our model does not need to learn a dictionary and directly sparsely codes the motion features of the center patches with features of its surrounding patches. The sparse coding error is used to measure the motion attention intensity of the center patch. To reflect the crowd abnormal intensity, an online updated weighting scheme is designed to obtain the global activity intensity map. Two publicly available datasets-UMN dataset and UCSD Ped1 dataset are utilized to evaluate our approach in detecting global abnormal event and local abnormal event, respectively. The experiments show our method achieves the promising performance and is competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Level set technique is novelly introduced into the mean shift sample space to implement kernel evolution and update. Since the active contour model is designed to drive the kernel constantly to the direction that maximizes target likelihood, the kernel can adapt to target shape variation simultaneously with the mean shift iterations. Thus, it can give a better estimation bias to produce accurate shift of the mean and successfully avoid performance loss stemmed from pollution of the non-object regions hiding inside the kernel. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the technique.",

      "abstract": "Planar-mirror-based catadioptric method is one of the most hot topics in recent years. To overcome the disadvantages of the planar-mirror-based catadioptric panoramic camera, described by Nalwa (1996, 2001, 2000), such as the requirement for high-precision optical device designing and the stitching lines in the resulting images, we proposed a planar-mirror-based video image mosaic system with high precision for designing. Firstly, we designed a screw nut on our system, which can be adjusted to locate the viewpoints of the cameras' mirror images at a single point approximately. It provides a method for those who have difficulties in their designing and manufacturing for high precision. Then, after the image distortion correction and cylinder projection transforms, we can stitch the images to get a wide field of view image by template matching algorithm. Finally, nonlinear weighting fusion is adopted to eliminate the stitching line effectively. The experimental results show that our system has good characteristics such as video rate capture, high resolution, no stitching line and without affection by the depth of field of view.",

      "abstract": "A novel approach based on a refined level sets method is presented in this paper for non-rigid object tracking. In contrast with conventional level sets methods, which are blind to target and emphasize the intensity consistency only, the proposed level set method is strengthened by making full use of the tracking context. By associating multiple feature spaces, the most discriminative target information is extracted and fused into the energy functional to drive the curve evolution. Therefore, the proposed level set method can lead an accurate convergence to the object in real-world tracking applications, as well as solving multi-mode object segmentation problem facing a typical level-set tracker. The update mechanism implemented on the target model enables tracking to continue under occlusion. Experiments confirm the robustness and reliability of our method.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent video surveillance is currently one of the most active research topics in computer vision, especially when facing the explosion of video data captured by a large number of surveillance cameras. As a key step of an intelligent surveillance system, robust visual tracking is very challenging for computer vision. However, it is a basic functionality of the human visual system (HVS). Psychophysical findings have shown that the receptive fields of simple cells in the visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented, and bandpass, and it forms a sparse, distributed representation of natural images. In this article, motivated by these findings, we propose an effective appearance model based on sparse coding and apply it in visual tracking. Specifically, we consider the responses of general basis functions extracted by independent component analysis on a large set of natural image patches as features and model the appearance of the tracked target as the probability distribution of these features. In order to make the tracker more robust to partial occlusion, camouflage environments, pose changes, and illumination changes, we further select features that are related to the target based on an entropy-gain criterion and ignore those that are not. The target is finally represented by the probability distribution of those related features. The target search is performed by minimizing the Matusita distance between the distributions of the target model and a candidate using Newton-style iterations. The experimental results validate that the proposed method is more robust and effective than three state-of-the-art methods.",

In this paper, motivated by the fact that a tracked object is usual- ly embedded into context that provides useful information for estimating the target, we propose a novel tracking algorithm named Tracking with Context Prediction (TCP). The context here includes the neighboring objects and specific parts of tar- get. The proposed method simultaneously track the target and context objects using the existing tracking methods. The positions of the context objects are used to predict the position of the target. Thus, the target can be stably tracked even when it is partially or fully occluded. By computing the probability of each prediction being target, our algorithm allows the drifting of context objects during tracking and do not require predictions from all context objects are correct. Experiments on challenging sequences show significant improvements especially in the case of occlusions and appearance changes.",

In contrast with traditional level set models which emphasize the intensity consistent segmentation and consider no priors, the proposed DAMLSM takes the context of tracking into account and use a discriminative patch based target model to guide the curve evolution. By modeling both the region and edge cues in a Bayesian manner, the proposed level set method can lead an accurate convergence to the candidate region with maximum likelihood of being the target. Finally, we update the target model to adapt to the appearance variation, enabling tracking to continue under occlusion. Experiments confirm the robustness and reliability of our method.",

The discriminative ability of SRA derives from the fact that the subset which most compactly expresses the input signal is activated in the regression analysis. To achieve a further improvement, Kernelized SRA (KSRA) is developed to make a nonlinear extension of SRA. The experiments are conducted on both palmprint and face recognition, which show that the proposed methods achieve a much better performance than sparse representation classifier, principal component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis.",

Conventional mean shift based trackers exploit only appearance information of observation to determine the target location which usually cannot effectively distinguish the foreground from background in complex scenes. In contrast, by constructing the inertial potential model, the proposed algorithm makes good use of motion information of previous frames adaptively to track the target. Then the probability of all candidates is modeled by considering both the photometric and motion cues in a Bayesian manner, leading the mean shift vector finally converge to the location with maximum likelihood of being the target. Experimental results on several challenging video sequences have verified that the proposed method is compared very robust and effective with the traditional mean shift based trackers in many complicated scenes.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel approach to non-rigid object tracking based on a supervised level set model (SLSM). In contrast with conventional level set models, which emphasize the intensity consistency only and consider no priors, the curve evolution of the proposed SLSM is object-oriented and supervised by the specific knowledge of the target we want to track. Therefore, the SLSM can ensure a more accurate convergence to the target in tracking applications. In particular, we firstly construct the appearance model for the target in an on-line boosting manner due to its strong discriminative power between objects and background. Then the probability of the contour is modeled by considering both the region and edge cues in a Bayesian manner, leading the curve converge to the candidate region with maximum likelihood of being the target. Finally, accurate target region qualifies the samples fed the boosting procedure as well as the target model prepared for the next time step. Positive decrease rate is used to adjust the learning pace over time, enabling tracking to continue under partial and total occlusion. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the technique.",

      "abstract": "Digital matting, the process of extracting a foreground object from an image, is an important task in image and video editing. Applying matting techniques to Chinese painting image processing can create novel composites or facilitate other editing tasks. However, Chinese paintings are painted on xuan-paper or silk, the semi-transparent strokes resulted from the diffusion and penetration of ink and pigments make it difficult to extract the foreground from the paintings only based on three-band image. In this paper, we demonstrate a new multispectral image matting technique for Chinese painting image editing. We derive a similarity function from Kubelka-Munk turbid media theory, and this allows us to find the optimal alpha matte. By adopting multispectral matting method, semitransparent foreground stroke can be extracted from the overlay of background strokes. Experimental results show the approach acceptable and promising.",

      "abstract": "Occlusion inference is an extremely difficult problem in visual tracking, especially when the target is occluded fully. In this paper, we proposed a novel visual tracking algorithm to solve this problem, which is based on occlusion edge detection and particle redistribution. Firstly, it judges whether there is occlusion or not. Then if the target happen to be occluded, the occlusion edge is able to be detected. Finally particles are assigned to redistribute around the occlusion edge. Once the target appears again from occlusion, the tracker could capture the target at the same moment. The algorithm could make tracking appeared objects or part of objects occurring in any frame. Experimental results verified that the proposed method outperforms traditional particle filter tracker.",

We model the object to be tracked with a RGB color histogram and multiple histograms of oriented gradients (HOG). Modeling object using only the former, a global appearance model, is widely used in visual tracking. However, it suffers many challenges such as illumination changes and pose changes and so on. In order to overcome this problem, we also model the object with multiple block based HOG histograms. The HOG histogram is a local appearance model and can effectively represent the shape information of the object which also gain increasing interests in computer vision especially in pedestrian detection. These two appearance models are complementary and used in the particle filter tracking framework. We test the performance of the proposed method on several challenging sequences, which verifies that our method outperforms the standard particle filter and achieves significant improvement.",

      "abstract": "Computer assisted diagnosis has been widely used in practice with the fast development of medical imaging. As a key technique, medical image processing plays an essential role in computer assisted diagnosis. However, most pattern discovering methods focus on human structure images as CT, MRT while very little work has been done in micrograph. In this paper, we proposed a set of simple statistical operations to detect accompanying pattern in micrograph. The samples of different tissues are compared from both spatial distribution and growing direction to check if they fit in the same pattern. The main purpose of this research is to help cancer expert analyze the cause of cancer. Taken breast cancer as experimental case, our results illustrated the accompanying pattern between blood vessels and dead cells.",

However, existing feature representation schemes are not effective enough to use MIL to detect video caption frames from news video, which hinders the practical applications of CBVR. This paper presents an algorithm that regards the video frames containing caption as a bag. It detects, localizes and extracts video caption frames using multiple-instance learning (MIL) automatically. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect, localize, and extract video caption frames with more high accuracy.",

In this paper, we utilized Au‐doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays to design a photoelectrochemical immunosensor for the detection of α‐SYN. The highly ordered TiO 2 nanotubes were fabricated by using an electrochemical anodization technique on pure Ti foil. After that, a photoelectrochemical deposition method was exploited to modify the resulting nanotubes with Au nanoparticles, which have been demonstrated to facilitate the improvement of photocurrent responses. Moreover, the Au‐doped TiO 2 nanotubes formed effective antibody immobilization arrays and immobilized primary antibodies (Ab 1 ) with high stability and bioactivity to bind target α‐SYN. The enhanced sensitivity was obtained by using {Ab 2 ‐Au‐GOx} bioconjugates, which featured secondary antibody (Ab 2 ) and glucose oxidase (GOx) labels linked to Au nanoparticles for signal amplification. The GOx enzyme immobilized on the prepared immunosensor could catalyze glucose in the detection solution to produce H 2 O 2 , which acted as a sacrificial electron donor to scavenge the photogenerated holes in the valence band of TiO 2 nanotubes upon irradiation of the other side of the Ti foil and led to a prompt photocurrent. The photocurrents were proportional to the α‐SYN concentrations, and the linear range of the developed immunosensor was from 50 pg mL −1 to 100 ng mL −1 with a detection limit of 34 pg mL −1 . The proposed method showed high sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and could become a promising technique for protein detection.",

In contrast with traditional trackers whose computations cover the whole target region and may easily be polluted by the similar background pixels, we divided the target into a number of patches and take the most discriminative one as the tracking basis. With the consideration of both the photometric and spatial information, we construct a discriminative target model on it. Then, a likelihood map can be got by comparing the target model with candidate regions, on which the mean shift procedure is employed for mode seeking. Finally, we update the target model to adapt to the appearance variation. Experiments confirm the robustness and reliability of our method.",

      "abstract": "This paper designs a novel hiding strategy based on an equivalence relation, which can remarkably enhance the quality of stego image without sacrificing the security and capacity of original steganography schemes. According to a constructed equivalence relation based on the capacity of hiding units, all hiding units can be partitioned into equivalence classes. Following that, the hiding procedure is performed in predefined order in equivalence classes as the traditional steganography scheme. Because of considering the relation between the length of message and capacity, the performance of the hiding method using proposed hiding strategy outperforms the original approaches when embedding the same length message. Experimental results indicate that the gain from the proposed strategy over existing hiding schemes can reach up to 4.0 dB.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel and robust object tracking algorithm based on sparse representation. Object tracking is formulated as a object recognition problem rather than a traditional search problem. All target candidates are considered as training samples and the target template is represented as a linear combination of all training samples. The combination coefficients are obtained by solving for the minimum l1-norm solution. The final tracking result is the target candidate associated with the non-zero coefficient. Experimental results on two challenging test sequences show that the proposed method is more effective than the widely used mean shift tracker.",

      "abstract": "Object tracking plays a very important role in many computer vision applications. However its performance will significantly deteriorate due to some challenges in complex scene, such as pose and illumination changes, clustering background and so on. In this paper, we propose a robust object tracking algorithm which exploits both global color and local scale invariant (SIFT) features in a particle filter framework. Due to the expensive computation cost of SIFT features, the proposed tracker adopts a speed-up variation of SIFT, SURF, to extract local features. Specially, the proposed method first finds matching points between the target model and target candidate, than the weight of the corresponding particle based on scale invariant features is computed as the the proportion of matching points of that particle to matching points of all particles, finally the weight of the particle is obtained by combining weights of color and SURF features with a probabilistic way. The experimental results on a variety of challenging videos verify that the proposed method is robust to pose and illumination changes and is significantly superior to the standard particle filter tracker and the mean shift tracker.",

      "abstract": "Traditional particle filter which uses simple geometric shapes for representation cannot track objects with complex shape accurately. In this paper, we propose a refined particle filter method for contour tracking based on a binary level set model. In contrast with other previous work, the computational efficiency is greatly improved due to the simple form of the level set function. In addition, we perform curve evolution in the update step to make good use of the observation at current time. Finally, we consider some appearance information as well as the energy function to measure the weight for particles, which can identify the target more accurately. Experiment results on several challenging video sequences have verified the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective in many complicated scenes.",

      "abstract": "Partial occlusion is one of the most challenging difficulties for object tracking. In this paper, we present an approach to address this problem by using an effective appearance model which has two innovations. First, in contrast to widely used color histogram that models the appearance of an object using only color information, we assert that both color and texture are important cues for tracking, especially in the presence of complex background. We thus propose a novel local descriptor, named local color texture pattern (LCTP), to model the appearance of the object with color and texture information simultaneously. Second, global color histogram completely ignores the spatial layout information of an object and are sensitive to partial occlusion. In this work, we overcome this limitation based on a block-dividing way: 1) divide target into multiple blocks and then represent each block with LCTP histogram, 2) with a selectivity strategy, we select blocks that are not occluded and then combine similarities of those selected blocks to obtain final similarity measure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to partial occlusion than two state-of-the-art algorithms.",

For watermarking algorithms based on SS, the embedding strength is always the key factor of robustness. Guided by the JND (Just Noticeable Distortion) model in DCT domain and the characteristics of DCT, a more reasonable embedding strength is proposed. First, all DC coefficients of DCT blocks in one frame are collected and then segmented into some sub-sequences, which makes the distribution of watermark energy more even and consequently improves its robustness. Second, the JND value sequences of the segmented DC coefficients are computed, and DCT is applied to these sequences. Third, the resulting DC coefficients are used as the embedding strengths so that higher correlation values will be obtained during the detection. At the same time, in order to resist collusion attack, the proposed algorithm will segment the video into scenes. Compared with the algorithm of using JND as the embedding strength directly, the proposed method improves the robustness effectively. In fact, it also has good robustness to several attacks, such as video compression attacks at different bit-rate, frame dropping and slightly geometric transformation and so on.",

      "abstract": "Psychophysical findings have shown that human vision system has an ability to improve target search by enhancing the representation of image components that are related to the searched target, which is the so-called feature-based visual attention. In this paper, motivated by these psychophysical findings, we propose a robust visual tracking algorithm by simulating such feature-based visual attention. Specially, we consider the general sparse basis functions extracted on a large set of natural image patches as features. We define that a feature is related to the target when succeeding activations of that feature cannot increase system's entropy. The target is finally represented by the probability distribution of those related features. The target search is performed by minimizing the Matusita distance measure between the distributions of the target model and candidate using Newton-style iterations. The experimental results verify that the proposed method is more robust and effective than widely used mean shift based methods.",

A notion of pairwise stability is applied to analyze firms’ incentives for cross-holdings. Under Cournot competition on output market and a restriction on how much equity a firm can hold in another firm, it is shown that (i) there is a unique pairwise stable cross-holding structure, in which firms hold the maximum allowable amount of equity in their rivals when there are two firms; (ii) there is a wide range of pairwise stable cross-holding structures when there are three firms, in each of which one firm retains all its own equity and holds the same allowable amount of equity in each of the other two firms, who in turn do not have any equity holdings in other firms; and (iii) the only pairwise stable cross-holding structure is the one with no cross-holdings when there are four or more firms. Our result implies that cross-holdings induce collusive behavior when the market is more concentrated.",

      "abstract": "Traditional background subtraction methods perform poorly when scenes contain dynamic backgrounds such as waving tree branches, spouting fountain, illumination changes, camera jitters, etc. In this paper, from the view of spatial context, we present a novel and effective dynamic background method with three contributions. First, we present a novel local dependency descriptor, called local dependency histogram (LDH), to effectively model the spatial dependencies between a pixel and its neighboring pixels. The spatial dependencies contain substantial evidence for differentiating dynamic background regions from moving objects of interest. Second, based on the proposed LDH, an effective approach to dynamic background subtraction is proposed, in which each pixel is modeled as a group of weighted LDHs. Labeling a pixel as foreground or background is done by comparing the LDH computed in current frame against its model LDHs. The model LDHs are adaptively updated by the current LDH. Finally, unlike traditional approaches using a fixed threshold to judge whether a pixel matches to its model, an adaptive thresholding technique is also proposed. Experimental results on a diverse set of dynamic scenes validate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods for dynamic background subtraction.",

Under certain conditions and Cournot competition on the output market, it is shown that monopoly is the only outcome of pairwise stable cross-holdings when there are two firms; a wide range of outcomes is possible when there are three firms, including as special cases the triopoly and the duopoly Cournot equilibria without any cross-holding; and the Cournot equilibrium is an outcome of pairwise stable cross-holdings when there are four or more firms. Competitive implications of the results are also briefly discussed.",

Multi-dimension transfer function can achieve high rendering quality, but suffer from troublesome user specifications. In order to reduce the complexity of manipulations, a transfer function design method based on dimension reduction model is proposed in this paper. The idea of dimension reduction model is to integrate several data features into one index for transfer function. This paper also presents one instance of dimension reduction model called acting force model (AFM) to verity the effectiveness. In AFM, one integrated index is calculated by applying transformative universal gravitation formula and kinetic energy formula to three data features: scalar value, gradient and coherence distance. The experiments demonstrate the proposed method can produce flexible results without overloading the users.",

Therefore, integrated and control management information system of construction engineering project enterprises groups (ICMISCPEG) has being used increasingly. The concept of ICMISCPEG is firstly analyzed, and then its establishment is expounded from data planning and system framework designing. As a case of CCCC (China Communications Construction Company Ltd) Second Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is studied, approves that ICMISCPEG is an effective methods for the construction enterprises groups to decide, plan, implement and control coordinately.",

      "abstract": "Background subtraction in dynamic scenes is an important and challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel and effective method for dynamic background subtraction based on covariance matrix descriptor. The algorithm integrates two distinct levels: pixel level and region level. At the pixel level, spatial properties that are obtained from pixel coordinate values, and appearance properties, i.e., intensity, texture, gradient, etc, are used as features of each pixel. In the region level, the correlation of features extracted at the pixel level is represented by a covariance matrix that is calculated over a rectangle region around the pixel. Each pixel is modeled as a group of weighted adaptive covariance matrices. Experimental results on a diverse set of dynamic scenes show that the proposed method dramatically out-performs traditional methods for dynamic background subtraction.",

These methods will perform poorly in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a solution to this problem. We first extend the local binary patterns from spatial domain to spatio-temporal domain, and present a new online dynamic texture extraction operator, named spatio-temporal local binary patterns (STLBP). Then we present a novel and effective method for dynamic background modeling and subtraction using STLBP. In the proposed method, each pixel is modeled as a group of STLBP dynamic texture histograms which combine spatial texture and temporal motion information together. Compared with traditional methods, experimental results show that the proposed method adapts quickly to the changes of the dynamic background. It achieves accurate detection of moving objects and suppresses most of the false detections for dynamic changes of nature scenes.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel feature-level Multiple HMMs classifier for lipreading is presented.Firstly, it subdivides mouth images into four non-overlapping subblocks.Then AdaBoost is used to adaptively select optimal Gabor kernels from four sub-blocks convolved with different Gabor kernel functions and corresponding HMMs are trained.Finally the \"boosted\" HMMs are used to build a stronger multiple HMMs classifier by combining the decisions of the composite HMMs according to a probability synthesis rule.The method is evaluated on Bimodal Chinese Audio-Video Database (HIT Bi-CAVDB).Experimental results show that the proposed method gives distinctly superior recognition rate than traditional methods.",

      "abstract": "The basic theory of the Finite Element Method is presented in detail. According to the practice of the propulsion shaft alignment, some improvements are made in the stiffness matrix due to taking the shear deformation effect into consideration. Based on the presented algorithm, the propulsion shaft alignment calculation program is developed in VB.NET language. By comparing calculation results with the output of other similar software without considering the shear deformation effect and the application in practice, it is proved that these improvements in the Finite Element Method are reasonable and can obtain more accurate results. The user-friendly interfaces, perfect functions and simple operations are included in the software, which meets the need of the checkout of the marine propulsion shaft and consummates the propulsion shaft alignment calculation model. It is convenient for the further redevelopment and study.",

      "abstract": "Rainfall brings urban residents both benefits, such as water resources, but also adverse risks such as flooding. Additionally, it has been recognized that wet weather run-off discharges pollutants and transfers chemicals and pathogen bacteria into the aquatic ecosystem. This causes not only deterioration of water quality but also environmental pollution risk. Both the flood risk and environmental pollution risk are treated here as ‘rainfall-related environmental risks’. Although these two kinds of risks are quite different in their characteristics, the main purpose of urban wet weather flow management is how to decrease these risks. Furthermore, these risks have a similar background which is concerned with both the urban structure and the life-style of urban residents. Recently, flood disaster has occurred in the Japanese urban area with increasing frequency causing damage due not only to rainfall intensity, but also the vulnerability of urban structures against heavy storms. Although there has been urban area expansion and a decline in substrate permeability, wet weather flow management in Japan is aimed simply to drain the increased run-off volume quickly. As for the management of hazardous chemicals which might be discharged together with rainfall run-off, this has not been implemented sufficiently. It is necessary to develop a methodology to reduce rainfall-related environmental risks in urban wet weather flow management. In this paper, the possible risk management process and control options of rainfall-related risks will be discussed after a summary of both the similar and differing points between inundation risk and environmental pollution risk. As a result, it is deemed necessary to operate a scheme to raise the rainfall-related environmental risk perception level of urban residents to ensure their participation in risk management.",

The discrete choice model based on a random utility theory is applied to the model theory in this paper. The result of the analysis is brought together as follows. 1) The choice model of recreation activities at the waterside can be modeled with the discrete choice model based on a random utility theory. 2) The utility function are composed by the variable which relates level of the recognition of the state for the waterside environment, physical attributes restrained visiting the waterside of river, individual attributes and a social situation. 3) The variable which decided whether to visit the waterside of river was able to be extracted in the analysis which used the sample made a pattern, such as the improvement of the water quality, planting the tree and constructing of the rest place along rivers, the existence of recreation time, the concern for waterside environment etc.",
